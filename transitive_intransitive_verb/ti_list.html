This page has been derived from several sources:
</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the material on the page of
 <a href="http://www.sf.airnet.ne.jp/%7Ets/japanese/message/jpnEUwEoW7XEUhMPq0e.html">transitive/intransitive verb pairs </a>
prepared by Shinji Takasugi. 
</li>
<li>additional verb pairs listed in William McClure's excellent book:
"Using Japanese" (Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000)
</li>
<li>verbs from the list in Ben Bullock's
 <a href="http://www.sljfaq.org/w/Transitive_and_intransitive_verbs">Alternative SLJ FAQ. </a>
</li>
<li>verb pairs suggested by the good people at the sci.lang.japan
Usenet newsgroup.
</li>
</ol>
The verbs have been matched against the EDICT file.
<p>
The first table has verbs where the transitive/intransitive pair
are related by an eru-aru pattern (ける→かる, げる→がる, etc.)
A few at the end are not quite regular in this formation.
