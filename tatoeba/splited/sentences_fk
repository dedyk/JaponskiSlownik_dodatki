7434318	eng	Perspecticide is often part of a strategy of coercive control that may include manipulation, stalking, and physical abuse. Abusers make their partners narrow their worlds.
7434319	eng	Once isolated, it is easy to lose one's sense of self. Abusers insist on controlling minute aspects of their partners' lives. Over time, victims internalize the rules and forget what life was like when they were freer to make their own choices.

7434325	eng	People subjected to perspecticide often blame themselves, as they feel despairing and disoriented. It can be hard for them to figure out exactly what’s wrong.
7434326	eng	Controlling partners serve as a filter for the outside world, gradually forcing their victims to lose the support of family, friends, and coworkers. Isolated and controlled in this way, victims lose self-esteem and have trouble remembering what they once thought, felt, and believed.
