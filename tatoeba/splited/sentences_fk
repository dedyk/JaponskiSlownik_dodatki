7416478	eng	But the Professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which would convict in a court of law.

7434317	rus	Не думаю, что мне будет страшно.
7434318	eng	Perspecticide is often part of a strategy of coercive control that may include manipulation, stalking, and physical abuse. Abusers make their partners narrow their worlds.
7434319	eng	Once isolated, it is easy to lose one's sense of self. Abusers insist on controlling minute aspects of their partners' lives. Over time, victims internalize the rules and forget what life was like when they were freer to make their own choices.
7434320	rus	Он нежно положил руку на её плечо.
7434321	eng	Abusers make their partners feel badly about themselves. Because they are isolated, people victimized by perspecticide begin to believe the negative descriptions of themselves and lose self-esteem.  Abusive partners create the expectations.

7434323	eng	The abuser demands certain acts as proof of love and over time, the person being victimized gives in.  "I do it because I care for you, because I love you, because I want to protect you."
7434324	rus	Я не хотел, чтобы Том страдал.
7434325	eng	People subjected to perspecticide often blame themselves, as they feel despairing and disoriented. It can be hard for them to figure out exactly what’s wrong.
7434326	eng	Controlling partners serve as a filter for the outside world, gradually forcing their victims to lose the support of family, friends, and coworkers. Isolated and controlled in this way, victims lose self-esteem and have trouble remembering what they once thought, felt, and believed.

You cannot understand the likes of such, because you have not had such an opportunity. Life is a lesson. Some are hard lessons, some unforgiving and damning. Some are irreversible and final.
