8071374	eng	Tom went to the train museum.
8071375	eng	There is an allure and excitement to the power of an old-fashioned steam train.
8071376	eng	Coal powered trains plied the rails in the United States for 175 years, starting in the 1830's, and were an integral part of America's westward expansion and industrial revolution.
8071377	deu	Das wissen wir bereits.
8071378	eng	From the earliest days of the republic, Americans broke their fast in the morning by eating whatever was most easily available, which often included bread, eggs or leftovers.
8071379	eng	Convenience is still a driving factor when it comes to breakfast.
8071380	eng	The habit of consuming certain foods for breakfast, such as cereal, is the result of extraordinarily effective marketing.
8071381	eng	“Advertising was practically invented to sell cereal,” says Heather Arndt Anderson, the author of "Breakfast: A History."
8071382	deu	Warum ist das falsch?
8071383	deu	Warum ist das verkehrt?
8071384	eng	As women entered the workforce to help support their families, cereal was a food kids could take care of on their own without having to do anything dangerous like light a stove.
8071385	eng	Advertising also played a key role in orange juice becoming a morning beverage.
8071386	eng	In 1916, a surplus of oranges gave birth to the advertising slogan, “Drink an orange,” which aimed to convince people that juicing an orange (or a few oranges) was a healthy way to start the day.
8071387	rus	Мне интересно, кто послал цветы.
8071388	eng	Coffee might have the 1773 Boston Tea Party to thank for its U.S. popularity. After the colonists protested British taxation by dumping tea into Boston Harbor, some made a point of shunning tea and turning to coffee instead.
8071389	eng	In a 1774 letter to his wife, Founding Father John Adams wrote, “I have drank Coffee every Afternoon since, and have borne it very well. Tea must be universally renounced.”
8071390	deu	Tom ist mit dem Ergebnis nicht zufrieden.
8071391	eng	By the 1830s, coffee was already such a staple that pioneers traveling to the American West made sure to pack coffee beans to have along on the journey.
8071392	eng	Pancakes have also been around practically forever.
8071393	deu	Tom ist mit dem Ergebnis unzufrieden.
8071394	eng	Researchers believe the world's oldest naturally preserved human mummy ate a pancake-like food as one of his last meals.
8071395	eng	Historians think it’s possible hotcakes were relegated to the morning because they are much quicker to prepare than bread. That left cooks with plenty of time to bake fresh loaves in time for dinner.
8071396	eng	In addition to pancakes, U.S. households still consume other breakfast foods — like bread and eggs — that their ancestors did.
8071397	eng	Looking toward the future, Arndt Anderson hopes more Americans will view leftovers as a breakfast food, which in addition to being tasty, is a great way to minimize waste.
8071398	eng	The power outage came on the anniversary of the 1977 New York City outage that left most of the city without power.
8071399	deu	Niemand außer Tom könnte das.
8071400	eng	The architecture of American homes is a lot like America itself, a hodgepodge of different styles from different countries often melded together into one whole.
8071401	eng	From colonials to Victorians to ranch-style houses and McMansions, the story of American residential architecture is that it tends to be eclectic.
8071402	eng	The history of American residential architecture has always been kind of like an all-you-can-eat buffet," says architect Susan Piedmont-Palladino, director of Virginia Tech's Washington Alexandria Architecture Center. "We can borrow anybody's style of architecture and I'm not sure that's the attitude in other countries around the world. I also think we're dominated by the single family house in a way that other places aren't."
8071403	eng	Most houses built today do not reflect any one style, but integrate ideas from many cultures.
8071404	eng	A single house can have a French-inspired mansard roof, Grecian columns, and English Tudor-inspired timbering.
8071405	eng	Built in 1930, this neoclassical Georgian home in Dallas, Texas, is a near-replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon home in Virginia.
8071406	eng	After the American Revolution, the architecture of public buildings often borrowed from Greece and Rome to express democratic ideals of order and symmetry.
8071407	eng	This neoclassic style also extended to private homes, notably Thomas Jefferson's Monticello and George Washington's Mount Vernon.
8071408	eng	The long reign of Britain's Queen Victoria, from 1837 until 1901, occurred during a time of American prosperity.
8071409	rus	Всех троих мужчин доставили в ближайшую больницу.
8071410	eng	Mass-production of building parts allowed for the construction of elaborate, affordable Victorian-style houses throughout the country.
8071411	eng	"During the Industrial Revolution, steel transformed the American landscape. The strength of this new metal made skyscrapers possible, rebuilding Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871," says Craven.
8071412	eng	The lavish Gilded Age mansions of the late 1800s and modern-day McMansions both reflect the conspicuous consumption of a powerful wealthy class.
8071413	eng	Minimalist post-Victorian architecture rebelled against excess.
8071414	eng	The 20th century brought new solutions for affordable housing.
8071415	eng	Catalogue companies like Sears sold mail order house kits, making home ownership achievable even during the Depression.
8071416	eng	The architect who most defined American residential architecture might well be Frank Lloyd Wright, who eschewed the idea of borrowing architecture from Europe or anywhere else.
8071417	deu	Tom glaubt, er sei stärker als ich.
8071418	eng	Frank Lloyd Wright pioneered housing features — such as low horizontal lines and open floor plans — that can still be found in suburban America today.
8071419	eng	Piedmont-Palladino is concerned that the home-building industry doesn't appear prepared to take on the challenge of building better-performing houses.
8071420	eng	Houses are getting bigger and bigger and less efficient, even as our families are getting smaller.
8071421	deu	Am glücklichsten bin ich, wenn ich schlafe.
8071422	eng	It’s early on a Saturday afternoon and nearly 400 weekend warriors have gathered to do battle on the grounds of a state park just outside Nashville, Tennessee. But they do not carry wooden or steel copies of medieval weapons. They take the field armed with arrows, swords and shields made from foam.
8071423	eng	Foam fighting, a type of Live Action Role Play, began in the mid-1970s in Washington, D.C., as a full-contact battle game with padded weapons.
8071424	deu	Heute scheint zwar die Sonne, aber es ist kalt.

8071426	deu	Nichts sagen, ja?
8071427	eng	A lot of the games started and originated from people reading ‘The Hobbit’ and ‘The Lord of The Rings’ series and wanting to be able to go out and relive that in real life.

8076741	eng	The similarities end there.
8076742	eng	Titan is so cold that water exists as rock-hard ice, and oily methane falls from the sky and trickles into the seas.

"Hé, évite d'être touché !" ajouta le Roi et les deux ricanèrent. Link, pris de court, sembla brièvement vexé, mais Zelda lui témoigna son soutien : "Ne t'occupe pas d'eux, Link. Ça ira. J'en suis sûr..." "Ne t'inquiète pas, Zelda. Tout ira bien." Link redevint aussitôt radieux. "Bien. Embrasse-moi avant de partir."

Due, ĉiuj aliaj movadoj por internaciaj lingvoj fiaskis, sed ne tiu de Esperanto, kiu plu kunigas aron da homoj ĉie en la mondo, ĉar malantaŭ Esperanto estas iu ideo, idealo.
8081217	epo	Mi celas ke Zamenhof ne nur konstruis lingvan objekton, sed ke malantaŭ tiu estis ideo — ideo de frateco, ideo pacisma. Tiun forton de idealo — pro kiu la esperantistoj eĉ estis persekutataj sub la naziismo kaj la stalinismo — konservas ankoraŭ la komunumo de la esperantistoj. Oni ne povas diri ke ĝi fiaskis, sed necesas diri unu aferon: la kialo pro kiu iu lingvo sukcesas, estas ĉiam nedifinebla.
8081218	eng	I have to some extent studied all of these utopias about creating a perfect language or from some original Adamic language, to those languages that are called universal, such as Esperanto, Volapük and others that aim not to be perfect languages but to be auxiliary languages.
8081219	eng	I have even studied the grammar of Esperanto to understand what it’s about, and I came to two conclusions. It is a very, very well-made language. From the linguistic viewpoint, it really follows admirable criteria of economy of language and efficiency. Secondly, all other movements for international languages have failed, but not that of Esperanto, which further unites humanity everywhere in the world, because behind Esperanto is an idea, an ideal.
8081220	eng	What I’m getting at is that Zamenhof not only built a linguistic object, but that behind that was an idea — an idea of brotherhood, a pacifist idea. That strength of an ideal — for which Esperantists were even persecuted under Nazism and Stalinism — is still conserved by the community of Esperantists. One cannot say that it has failed, but one thing needs to be said: the reason why any language is successful is always indefinable.

En tout genre, l’excellent est réduit à l’état d’exception, de cas isolé, perdu dans des millions d’autres ; et si parfois il arrive à se révéler dans quelque œuvre de durée, plus tard, quand cette œuvre a survécu aux rancunes des contemporains, elle reste solitaire, pareille à une pierre du ciel, que l’on conserve à part, comme un fragment détaché d’un monde soumis à un ordre différent du nôtre.

Il a été lancé le 4 décembre 1959, à bord d'une capsule cylindrique à l'intérieur du vaisseau spatial Mercury, au dessus d'une fusée Little Joe, afin de tester le système de déclenchement de la tour de sauvetage (LES). Au bout d'environ une minute de vol, à une vitesse de 5 929 km/h, la capsule Mercury s'est détachée du lanceur Little Joe. Après avoir atteint une altitude de 82 kilomètres, l'engin spatial s'est posé en toute sécurité dans l'océan Atlantique. Sam a été récupéré après quelques heures, sans aucune séquelles de son voyage.
