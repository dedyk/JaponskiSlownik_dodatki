2639639	eng	Tom and Mary stopped talking as soon as John came into the room.
2639640	eng	Tom wanted to ask Mary out, but he was afraid she would say no.
2639641	eng	Tom sensed someone was behind him and turned to see who it was.
2639642	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't have to stay here if she doesn't want to.
2639643	eng	Tom sat down next to Mary and they began talking to each other.
2639644	eng	Tom pointed to a word on the sign and asked Mary what it meant.
2639645	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting across the table from John and Alice.
2639646	eng	I'll be going on a picnic with Tom and his family next weekend.
2639647	eng	I know how difficult it is for you to admit that you are wrong.
2639648	eng	Tom waters his lawn at least once a week when there's no rain.
2639649	eng	Tom was with me in my apartment at the time Mary was murdered.
2639650	eng	Tom was standing in front of the grill wearing a cook's apron.
2639651	eng	Tom wants to change out of his wet clothes into something dry.
2639652	eng	Tom wants to ask you why you weren't at the meeting last week.
2639653	eng	Tom says he knows something about Mary that we don't know yet.
2639654	eng	Tom pulled something out of his pocket and put it on his desk.
2639655	eng	Tom opened the door and listened before he decided to walk in.
2639656	eng	Tom opened his briefcase and pulled out a couple of documents.
2639657	eng	Tom has some very important things he needs to do before 2:30.
2639658	eng	Tom got up and walked into the kitchen to get a cup of coffee.
2639659	eng	Tom and Mary looked embarrassed when John caught them kissing.
2639660	eng	Tom and Mary know each other, but they're not exactly friends.
2639661	eng	Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they plan to get married.
2639662	eng	Tom and Mary have been studying French together all afternoon.
2639663	eng	Is anyone here interested in going to the supermarket with me?
2639664	eng	If Tom had been careful, this accident wouldn't have happened.
2639665	eng	I hope you're not planning on wearing that dress to the party.
2639666	eng	Do you know what happens to people that do that kind of thing?
2639667	eng	You were in prison, so I had to raise our children by myself.
2639668	eng	When I stopped by this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
2639669	eng	We need to know everything that you know about the situation.
2639670	eng	Tom won't be able to do anything about the problem this week.
2639671	eng	Tom was watching TV in his underwear when I entered the room.
2639672	eng	Tom was surprised that Mary already knew about what happened.
2639673	eng	Tom walked into the living room with two drinks in his hands.
2639674	eng	Tom walked into his apartment and closed the door behind him.
2639675	eng	Tom remained in the car while Mary went into the supermarket.
2639676	eng	Tom doesn't do anything without first asking Mary if it's OK.
2639677	eng	Tom didn't just sprain his ankle. He broke three of his toes.
2639678	eng	Tom asked Mary some questions that she didn't want to answer.
2639679	eng	Tom and Mary were worried about getting caught by the police.
2639680	eng	Tom and Mary talked about what they should do with the money.
2639681	eng	Tom and Mary spent the evening talking about John's problems.
2639682	eng	Tom and Mary know each other, but they're not really friends.
2639683	eng	Tom and Mary haven't decided on a date for their wedding yet.
2639684	eng	Tom and Mary have lived in this neighborhood for a long time.
2639685	eng	Tom and Mary had really good seats at the concert last night.
2639686	eng	Tom and Mary got up from their seats and headed for the door.
2639687	eng	Tom and Mary don't have the time or the money to take a trip.
2639688	eng	Mary and her boyfriend are planning to visit Boston together.
2639689	eng	It's likely Tom and Mary will get married in the near future.
2639690	eng	It was hard for me to sell my guitar, but I needed the money.
2639691	eng	I spent three months in the hospital when I was thirteen.
2639692	eng	I never told Tom or anyone else about what happened that day.
2639693	eng	You'd better be very sure before you accuse Tom of anything.
2639694	eng	We know that you lied to us the last time we spoke together.
2639695	eng	Unfortunately, I believed all the lies that Tom was telling.
2639696	eng	Tom was the first person in our neighborhood to buy an iPad.
2639697	eng	Tom stopped in front of Mary's house and got out of his car.
2639698	eng	Tom should've listened more carefully to Mary's explanation.
2639699	eng	Tom pulled out an old shoebox from his closet and opened it.
2639700	eng	Tom picked up his coffee cup and started drinking out of it.
2639701	eng	Tom opened the trunk of his car and took out the spare tire.
2639702	eng	Tom opened the refrigerator and took out one of the bottles.
2639703	eng	Tom closed his eyes for a moment and considered his options.
2639704	eng	Tom asked Mary some questions that she was unable to answer.
2639705	eng	Tom and Mary went to a very expensive restaurant for dinner.
2639706	eng	Tom and Mary are sitting on the porch talking to each other.
2639707	eng	Tom and I used to hang out together when we were in college.
2639708	eng	Tom always checks the caller ID before he answers his phone.
2639709	eng	There's a woman waiting over there who wants to talk to you.
2639710	eng	The police fished a dead body out of the river this morning.
2639711	eng	If you hadn't interfered, we wouldn't have had any problems.
2639712	eng	I'll probably be back in Boston a couple of times next year.
2639713	eng	Do you think it'll be easy to find the kind of job you want?
2639714	eng	Would you and your friends like to play basketball with us?
2639715	eng	Tom was about to say something to Mary when his phone rang.
2639716	eng	Tom walked through the revolving door into the hotel lobby.
2639717	eng	Tom waited for three hours, but nobody came to pick him up.
2639718	eng	Tom said he saw a shark the other day when he was swimming.
2639719	eng	Tom paid for the shirt and the salesgirl put it into a bag.
2639720	eng	Tom knew it was a possibility that Mary would show up late.
2639721	eng	Tom fired his revolver at the man who had just killed Mary.
2639722	eng	Tom doesn't know if he can do what you're asking him to do.
2639723	eng	Tom and Mary seem to be having a very serious conversation.
2639724	eng	Tom and Mary haven't gone swimming together in a long time.
2639725	eng	The most logical place to keep your shoes is near the door.
2639726	eng	I need another can of paint to finish painting the ceiling.
2639727	eng	You'd be surprised at some of the things I know how to do.
2639728	eng	You said Tom was upset, but he didn't seem that way to me.
2639729	eng	What did you do with all that stuff you had in the garage?
2639730	eng	Tom walks his dog every afternoon as soon as he gets home.
2639731	eng	Tom took Mary's empty glass from her hand and refilled it.
2639732	eng	Tom took his glasses off and put the on the bedside table.
2639733	eng	Tom sat down on the park bench and began to read his book.
2639734	eng	Tom opened his suitcase again and put some more things in.
2639735	eng	Tom is slurring his words. I think he's drunk quite a lot.
2639736	eng	Tom found a hair in his soup and complained to the waiter.
2639737	eng	Tom bumped into Mary and almost knocked her into the pool.
2639738	eng	Tom and Mary were trapped in the elevator for three hours.
2639739	eng	Tom and Mary were having coffee together out on the porch.
2639740	eng	Tom and Mary usually get home later than their parents do.
2639741	eng	Tom and Mary spoke quietly so they wouldn't wake the baby.
2639742	eng	Tom and Mary split up after being married for three years.
2639743	eng	Tom and Mary both had no idea what John was talking about.
2639744	eng	It was hard for Tom to tell Mary that he wanted a divorce.
2639745	eng	I understand that you and Tom are planning to get married.
2639746	eng	I asked Tom if he wanted something to eat and he said yes.
2639747	eng	Have you ever seen Tom and Mary in the same room together?
2639748	eng	You're not the only one who can't attend today's meeting.
2639749	eng	Tom was the first paramedic on the scene of the accident.
2639750	eng	Tom waited for Mary to sit and then sat down next to her.
2639751	eng	Tom tried to remember the doctor's name, but he couldn't.
2639752	eng	Tom took off his wedding ring and threw it into the pond.
2639753	eng	Tom stood perfectly still, hoping he wouldn't be noticed.
2639754	eng	Tom pointed out several grammar mistakes on Mary's essay.
2639755	eng	Tom picked up one of the cans, opened it, and took a sip.
2639756	eng	Tom looked in the yellow pages to find a used car dealer.
2639757	eng	Tom knocked on the door and then entered without waiting.
2639758	eng	Tom knew the names of every baseball player on that team.
2639759	eng	Tom heard something and turned around to see what it was.
2639760	eng	Tom didn't want to believe the rumor about Mary and John.
2639761	eng	Tom blew on the embers, hoping to get the fire restarted.
2639762	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted a sandwich and she said yes.
2639763	eng	Tom and Mary were always fighting when they were younger.
2639764	eng	Tom and Mary got married when they were still very young.
2639765	eng	Tom and Mary both stared at John without saying anything.
2639766	eng	Tom and his two bodyguards came in through the back door.
2639767	eng	There were almost three hundred people in the auditorium.
2639768	eng	It would be a mistake not to do what Tom asked you to do.
2639769	eng	I think Tom might have taken something he shouldn't have.
2639770	eng	I liked your hair better when you parted it on the right.
2639771	eng	I just wasted three hours trying to get this thing fixed.
2639772	eng	You're not the only one here who wants to go home early.
2639773	eng	Why are you wearing a raincoat? It's not raining, is it?
2639774	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't as hungry as everyone else.
2639775	eng	Tom walked up to one of the houses and knocked the door.
2639776	eng	Tom sat down next to Mary and they smiled at each other.
2639777	eng	Tom opened a can of soup and emptied it into a saucepan.
2639778	eng	Tom looked over his shoulders, expecting to see someone.
2639779	eng	Tom didn't tell you about what happened to Mary, did he?
2639780	eng	Tom crawled into bed and pulled the covers over himself.
2639781	eng	Tom asked Mary some questions and she answered them all.
2639782	eng	Tom and Mary went for a walk even though it was raining.
2639783	eng	Tom and Mary stopped kissing when John entered the room.
2639784	eng	Tom and Mary seem to be waiting for something to happen.
2639785	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other since they were kids.
2639786	eng	Tom and Mary have a few kids, but I'm not sure how many.
2639787	eng	If Tom had been careful, he wouldn't have gotten killed.
2639788	eng	I've been working on this for just for a couple of days.
2639789	eng	I think Tom might have said something he shouldn't have.
2639790	eng	I hope you're not planning on wearing that to the party.
2639791	eng	Have you ever seen any famous people in this restaurant?
2639792	eng	You're always so worried about what other people think.
2639793	eng	You were the most beautiful woman at the party tonight.
2639794	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't as busy as everybody else.
2639795	eng	Tom took half of the cookies and put them on his plate.
2639796	eng	Tom took a breath and then started swimming underwater.
2639797	eng	Tom staggered out of the bar with a bottle in his hand.
2639798	eng	Tom shouldn't have interfered with what Mary was doing.
2639799	eng	Tom said there were three other Canadians at the party.
2639800	eng	Tom picked up the TV remote and turned down the volume.
2639801	eng	Tom peeked in the window and saw Mary and John kissing.
2639802	eng	Tom drives a truck and his wife drives a station wagon.
2639803	eng	Tom didn't say where he'd bought his new bass clarinet.
2639804	eng	Tom brought Mary a drink and placed it in front of her.
2639805	eng	Tom asked Mary some questions that she couldn't answer.
2639806	eng	Tom and three of his friends went camping last weekend.
2639807	eng	Tom and Mary sat on the doorstep talking to each other.
2639808	eng	Tom and Mary reached for the doorknob at the same time.
2639809	eng	Tom and Mary looked through all the items on the table.
2639810	eng	There's a woman in a wheelchair wanting to talk to you.
2639811	eng	The last time I saw Tom he was wearing a hospital gown.
2639812	eng	I have a feeling you and I have an awful lot in common.
2639813	eng	Are you saying that Tom can't understand French at all?
2639814	eng	You're the only person who hasn't yet made a donation.
2639815	eng	You know things are bad when they call Tom in to help.
2639816	eng	Why are you always the one deciding everything for us?
2639817	eng	Who do you think would be the best person for the job?
2639818	eng	Tom was leaning against a tree, sucking on a lollipop.
2639819	eng	Tom tried to discourage Mary from going out with John.
2639820	eng	Tom says Mary is lying about where she was last night.
2639821	eng	Tom offered Mary his arm and they walked off together.
2639822	eng	Tom might hire Mary, but I don't really know for sure.
2639823	eng	Tom honked his horn at the kids playing in the street.
2639824	eng	Tom hit one of the boys and knocked him to the ground.
2639825	eng	Tom had no choice but to give Mary what she asked for.
2639826	eng	Tom forgot his wedding anniversary and Mary was upset.
2639827	eng	Tom and Mary were watching television when I got home.
2639828	eng	Tom and Mary were discussing their problems with John.
2639829	eng	Tom and Mary sat on a park bench and talked for hours.
2639830	eng	Tom and Mary sat at the counter talking to each other.
2639831	eng	Tom and Mary had been married for three years by then.
2639832	eng	Tom and Mary aren't the only two who don't understand.
2639833	eng	Tom and Mary are having a dinner party Friday evening.
2639834	eng	There are a couple of parks not too far from my house.
2639835	eng	The party has been canceled due to a lack of interest.
2639836	eng	The doctor told us that what Tom has isn't contagious.
2639837	eng	Smoking is prohibited in all restaurants in this city.
2639838	eng	It isn't much fun going mountain climbing by yourself.
2639839	eng	I want everybody out of this room as soon as possible.
2639840	eng	I plan to be there thirty minutes before things start.
2639841	eng	I need you to go to the supermarket and buy some milk.
2639842	eng	I entered Tom's bedroom and saw him asleep in his bed.
2639843	eng	Do you know what Tom's nickname was when he was a kid?
2639844	eng	You'll never guess what happened just after you left.
2639845	eng	You were wearing a blue coat the day I first met you.
2639846	eng	You said there were three, but I could only find two.
2639847	eng	Why didn't you tell Tom the same thing you told Mary?
2639848	eng	We were in the neighborhood and thought we'd drop by.
2639849	eng	We know that everything we need to do is on the list.
2639850	eng	We know it'll happen sometime in the next three days.
2639851	eng	Tom will never understand why we want him to do this.
2639852	eng	Tom will be staying with us for the next three weeks.
2639853	eng	Tom used the key Mary had given him to open the door.
2639854	eng	Tom stopped laughing when he noticed Mary was crying.
2639855	eng	Tom put a dish with cheese and crackers on the table.
2639856	eng	Tom peeked out the window to see if it was safe to leave.
2639857	eng	Tom is one of the three men that came here yesterday.
2639858	eng	Tom has some very important things that he has to do.
2639859	eng	Tom has decided not to tell Mary about what happened.
2639860	eng	Tom had almost forgotten all about what had happened.
2639861	eng	Tom got into his car, closed the door and drove away.
2639862	eng	Tom didn't say much about what happened last weekend.
2639863	eng	Tom closed the magazine and put it into his knapsack.
2639864	eng	Tom came into the living room, not wearing any pants.
2639865	eng	Tom and Mary were able to figure it out on their own.
2639866	eng	There's not much traffic on this road after 8:00 p.m.
2639867	eng	My driver's license is valid for another three years.
2639868	eng	Keep in mind that Tom doesn't speak French very well.
2639869	eng	It's doubtful whether we can really sell our old car.
2639870	eng	It was hard for Tom to get his homework done on time.
2639871	eng	I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom doesn't come.
2639872	eng	I need to know everything there is to know about Tom.
2639873	eng	I have no idea how many people will be at the picnic.
2639874	eng	Have you ever seen people actually go into that cave?
2639875	eng	Did they do this kind of thing when you were a child?
2639876	eng	At about the same time, Tom was in his room studying.
2639877	eng	You know how important this job is to me, don't you?
2639878	eng	Why didn't you tell Tom the same time you told Mary?
2639879	eng	We have no information about what's going to happen.
2639880	eng	Tom's father is Canadian and his mother is Japanese.
2639881	eng	Tom won't believe Mary even if she swears it's true.
2639882	eng	Tom will never understand why people don't like him.
2639883	eng	Tom was not surprised by what he read in the report.
2639884	eng	Tom took his sunglasses off and handed them to Mary.
2639885	eng	Tom told Mary that John doesn't like to play tennis.
2639886	eng	Tom thought about it and agreed that Mary was right.
2639887	eng	Tom scooted over so Mary could sit down next to him.
2639888	eng	Tom says it's important for us to be there tomorrow.
2639889	eng	Tom said goodbye and then walked out the front door.
2639890	eng	Tom picked the coin up and examined it more closely.
2639891	eng	Tom is wearing the same clothes as he was yesterday.
2639892	eng	Tom helped Mary on the bus, and then got on himself.
2639893	eng	Tom has another problem he hasn't told us about yet.
2639894	eng	Tom got up from the table and went into the kitchen.
2639895	eng	Tom gave Mary three dollars and John thirty dollars.
2639896	eng	Tom finished his drink and then ordered another one.
2639897	eng	Tom doesn't need to read this if he doesn't want to.
2639898	eng	Tom does 100 sit-ups every morning before breakfast.
2639899	eng	Tom could hear Mary snoring loudly in the next room.
2639900	eng	Tom closed the door and he and Mary started kissing.
2639901	eng	Tom caught Mary's eye and then pointed at his watch.
2639902	eng	Tom and Mary want John to stay for a few more hours.
2639903	eng	Tom and Mary talked on the phone almost every night.
2639904	eng	Tom and Mary made their way through the crowded bar.
2639905	eng	Tom and Mary haven't heard from John in a long time.
2639906	eng	Tom and Mary haven't finished eating yet, have they?
2639907	eng	Tom and Mary have decided to get married next month.
2639908	eng	Tom and Mary have actually never been on a date yet.
2639909	eng	Tom and Mary are sitting in the living room talking.
2639910	eng	Tom and Mary agreed to work together on the project.
2639911	eng	Tom and I have worked together for over three years.
2639912	eng	This coffee tastes better than what I usually drink.
2639913	eng	Mary and some other women were here for a few hours.
2639914	eng	It must be about time for dinner. I'm really hungry.
2639915	eng	It might be kind of fun going to the beach with Tom.
2639916	eng	It isn't much fun just sitting here waiting for Tom.
2639917	eng	I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom doesn't win.
2639918	eng	I want to thank you for picking Tom up after school.
2639919	eng	I thought you'd be busy getting ready for your trip.
2639920	eng	You were so good at tennis. Why did you give it up?
2639921	eng	You said it was an emergency, so I came right away.
2639922	eng	You said almost all of your friends were Canadians.
2639923	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom ride a unicycle?
2639924	eng	Tom was the only one without enough money for the trip.
2639925	eng	Tom wanted to live in Boston with his grandparents.
2639926	eng	Tom waited under the tree until it stopped raining.
2639927	eng	Tom took the key off of the hook it was hanging on.
2639928	eng	Tom thought it would be a good idea to leave early.
2639929	eng	Tom stopped crying as soon as he saw Mary and John.
2639930	eng	Tom seems to be having a little difficulty in math.
2639931	eng	Tom says Mary needs more time to finish her report.
2639932	eng	Tom said that you and he went camping last weekend.
2639933	eng	Tom said he was at home on the night of the murder.
2639934	eng	Tom needs to find an apartment near where he works.
2639935	eng	Tom is the only boy here who doesn't like baseball.
2639936	eng	Tom is planning on entering the competition, right?
2639937	eng	Tom hasn't had time to do what you asked him to do.
2639938	eng	Tom had no choice but to give Mary what she wanted.
2639939	eng	Tom gave Mary a quick kiss and walked out the door.
2639940	eng	Tom felt Mary's forehead to see if she had a fever.
2639941	eng	Tom doesn't like riding his motorcycle in the rain.
2639942	eng	Tom didn't know what time he was supposed to leave.
2639943	eng	Tom didn't have enough time to finish his homework.
2639944	eng	Tom came into the lounge, carrying a cup of coffee.
2639945	eng	Tom asked Mary to meet him at John's house at 2:30.
2639946	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting on the sofa, watching TV.
2639947	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting on a bench near the pond.
2639948	eng	Tom and Mary walked out of the building in a hurry.
2639949	eng	Tom and Mary spent three hours discussing the plan.
2639950	eng	Tom and Mary sat there a long time without talking.
2639951	eng	Tom and Mary sat on the beach, watching the sunset.
2639952	eng	Tom and Mary said they had to work some things out.
2639953	eng	Tom and Mary need to get up early tomorrow morning.
2639954	eng	Tom and Mary know something they're not telling us.
2639955	eng	Tom and Mary got married in Boston three years ago.
2639956	eng	Tom and Mary are having a little financial trouble.
2639957	eng	This furniture was in my apartment when I moved in.
2639958	eng	They want something from us, but I don't know what.
2639959	eng	The doctor said that what Tom has isn't contagious.
2639960	eng	Keep an eye on my suitcase while I buy the tickets.
2639961	eng	It's doubtful whether I'll be able to come tonight.
2639962	eng	It'll be a long time before I come back here again.
2639963	eng	I'm fairly certain that Tom will pass today's exam.
2639964	eng	Do you think it'll be easy to find a job in Boston?
2639965	eng	Could you come to my office when you have a moment?
2639966	eng	Come on, Tom, aren't you just a little bit curious?
2639967	eng	You're not the only one here who can speak French.
2639968	eng	When was the last time you played tennis with Tom?
2639969	eng	Tom's not the only one around here who likes Mary.
2639970	eng	Tom was about to complain, but decided against it.
2639971	eng	Tom walked down the street whistling a happy tune.
2639972	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been abducted by aliens.
2639973	eng	Tom says you're lying about what time you arrived.
2639974	eng	Tom sat on that park bench for nearly three hours.
2639975	eng	Tom said he was at your house yesterday afternoon.
2639976	eng	Tom said he needed three hundred thousand dollars.
2639977	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go to the park with us.
2639978	eng	Tom regrets not doing what his father recommended.
2639979	eng	Tom pushed Mary into the room and closed the door.
2639980	eng	Tom piled everything up in the center of the room.
2639981	eng	Tom picked up his guitar and headed for the stage.
2639982	eng	Tom peeked out the door to see what was happening.
2639983	eng	Tom noticed that someone was standing behind Mary.
2639984	eng	Tom must've had some reason for doing what he did.
2639985	eng	Tom isn't the only one here that can speak French.
2639986	eng	Tom is wearing the sunglasses he bought yesterday.
2639987	eng	Tom is wearing the same clothes he wore yesterday.
2639988	eng	Tom has had so many chances to do the right thing.
2639989	eng	Tom grabbed his keys and put them into his pocket.
2639990	eng	Tom got on the bus and the driver closed the door.
2639991	eng	Tom gave Mary a dirty look and then left the room.
2639992	eng	Tom filled his glass and then filled one for Mary.
2639993	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that if he doesn't want to.
2639994	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary had just gotten married.
2639995	eng	Tom could've figured that out without Mary's help.
2639996	eng	Tom asked us a few questions and we answered them.
2639997	eng	Tom and Mary won't play tennis together this week.
2639998	eng	Tom and Mary seldom speak to each other in French.
2639999	eng	Tom and Mary sat at a table close to the entrance.
2640000	eng	Tom and Mary looked as if they might start crying.
2640001	eng	Tom and Mary haven't unpacked their suitcases yet.

2640007	eng	Tom and Mary are thinking about getting a divorce.
2640008	eng	Tom and Mary are running a little behind schedule.
2640009	eng	Somebody must have taken your umbrella by mistake.
2640010	eng	My driver's license is valid for three more years.
2640011	eng	Mary slipped off her robe and got into the shower.
2640012	eng	Mary came into the living room wearing a bathrobe.
2640013	eng	Mary and Alice both married men younger than them.
2640014	eng	Let us know if anyone else comes into the theater.
2640015	eng	It's possible Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
2640016	eng	It's not unusual for Tom to go to bed before 9:00.
2640017	eng	It's been a long time since I've heard that song.
2640018	eng	I was on the phone with Tom just five minutes ago.
2640019	eng	I need to know everything that you know about Tom.
2640020	eng	I kicked my son out of the house three months ago.
2640021	eng	I hope we have better weapons than the enemy does.
2640022	eng	I have more important things to do this afternoon.
2640023	eng	I guess asking Tom to help is out of the question.
2640024	eng	Have you ever seen a shark over three meters long?
2640025	eng	Boston is one of the places I visited last summer.
2640026	eng	You're wearing the ring Tom gave you, aren't you?
2640027	eng	You're not allowed to have pets in this building.
2640028	eng	You were with Tom the night he died, weren't you?
2640029	eng	You know the difference between these, don't you?
2640030	eng	Why don't you believe Tom when he says he's busy?
2640031	eng	We're now about a hundred miles away from Boston.
2640032	eng	We were on a plane flying to Boston at that time.
2640033	eng	We have a lot of other things we should be doing.
2640034	eng	Tom's mother told him to quit jumping on his bed.
2640035	eng	Tom was three meters away when the bomb exploded.
2640036	eng	Tom was standing in front of the guest room door.
2640037	eng	Tom was my younger brother's roommate in college.

2640046	eng	Tom says he's the best tennis player at his club.
2640047	eng	Tom saw what was happening and started screaming.
2640048	eng	Tom saw that Mary was fast asleep in the hammock.
2640049	eng	Tom said you had something you wanted to tell me.
2640050	eng	Tom said this kind of thing happens all the time.
2640051	eng	Tom said there was a party at your place tonight.
2640052	eng	Tom said it was cold in Boston this time of year.
2640053	eng	Tom pulled out a sandwich from a brown paper bag.
2640054	eng	Tom picked up the saltshaker and salted his eggs.
2640055	eng	Tom opened the freezer and got out the ice cream.
2640056	eng	Tom opened the box and took out a beautiful ring.
2640057	eng	Tom noticed a police car in the rear-view mirror.
2640058	eng	Tom might not really be as busy as he says he is.
2640059	eng	Tom is the only one with the key to this cabinet.
2640060	eng	Tom is overweight, but not as overweight as Mary.
2640061	eng	Tom is in the living room, watching sports on TV.
2640062	eng	Tom is in the kitchen, having a late-night snack.
2640063	eng	Tom hates Mary, but not as much as she hates him.
2640064	eng	Tom hated Mary, but not as much as she hated him.
2640065	eng	Tom followed behind Mary, carrying two suitcases.
2640066	eng	Tom enrolled in night classes at a local college.
2640067	eng	Tom didn't expect to hear back from Mary so soon.
2640068	eng	Tom didn't believe the rumor about Mary and John.
2640069	eng	Tom couldn't do it, so he asked Mary to help him.
2640070	eng	Tom could understand what Mary was trying to say.
2640071	eng	Tom and Mary went on a picnic with John and Alice.
2640072	eng	Tom and Mary walked down the path, holding hands.
2640073	eng	Tom and Mary told us they wouldn't fight anymore.
2640074	eng	Tom and Mary like to get together and play cards.
2640075	eng	Tom and Mary intend to get married in the spring.
2640076	eng	Tom and Mary have been in Boston for three years.
2640077	eng	Tom and Mary have been best of friends for years.
2640078	eng	Tom and Mary excused themselves and went outside.
2640079	eng	Tom and Mary both don't understand French at all.
2640080	eng	Tom and John are double-dating the Jackson twins.
2640081	eng	There's nobody in the house. Everybody's outside.
2640082	eng	There's no one in the house. They're all outside.
2640083	eng	The police have one of the kidnappers in custody.
2640084	eng	The police found Tom's body on the kitchen floor.
2640085	eng	None of Tom's classmates knew who his father was.
2640086	eng	Mary and the other women left thirty minutes ago.
2640087	eng	Let's buy something for you to wear to the party.
2640088	eng	It's possible Tom won't attend the meeting today.
2640089	eng	It was hard for Tom to admit that he needed help.
2640090	eng	I understand that you are a good friend of Tom's.
2640091	eng	I know that you and Tom skipped school yesterday.
2640092	eng	I know how difficult it is for you to believe me.
2640093	eng	I don't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
2640094	eng	Have you ever seen Tom and Mary dancing together?
2640095	eng	You've never wanted the same things I've wanted.
2640096	eng	You're not the only one who's afraid of heights.
2640097	eng	You'll probably have problems one of these days.
2640098	eng	Would you like me to help you with your luggage?
2640099	eng	We're about three blocks from the train station.
2640100	eng	Tom won't be going camping with us this weekend.
2640101	eng	Tom was worried that you wouldn't like his gift.
2640102	eng	Tom was wondering if Mary would go out with him.
2640103	eng	Tom was surprised by how well Mary spoke French.
2640104	eng	Tom was in almost every picture in Mary's album.
2640105	eng	Tom was gunned down just outside the courthouse.
2640106	eng	Tom was drinking chocolate milk through a straw.
2640107	eng	Tom was a little surprised by Mary's conclusion.
2640108	eng	Tom wanted to know why Mary didn't want to come.
2640109	eng	Tom walked down the hall and into Mary's office.
2640110	eng	Tom waited for Mary to say more, but she didn't.
2640111	eng	Tom sprained his ankle, but he's going to be OK.
2640112	eng	Tom seems to be waiting for something to happen.
2640113	eng	Tom seems to be angry, but not as angry as Mary.
2640114	eng	Tom scribbled down some details in his notebook.
2640115	eng	Tom says that the three of you are his brothers.
2640116	eng	Tom sat on the porch, reading the evening paper.
2640117	eng	Tom said something to Mary that I couldn't hear.
2640118	eng	Tom said he was the one who was driving the car.
2640119	eng	Tom said he was planning to wear a black tuxedo.
2640120	eng	Tom said he was having dinner with Mary tonight.
2640121	eng	Tom rushed into his office and slammed the door.
2640122	eng	Tom put down his coffee and picked up his phone.
2640123	eng	Tom probably didn't even know about the meeting.
2640124	eng	Tom pointed to the floor near Mary's right foot.
2640125	eng	Tom picked up the glass of juice and took a sip.
2640126	eng	Tom picked Mary up and put her in her highchair.
2640127	eng	Tom opened the envelope and took out the letter.
2640128	eng	Tom looked through the small window in the door.
2640129	eng	Tom looked surprised at how well Mary was doing.
2640130	eng	Tom isn't the only one here that is from Boston.
2640131	eng	Tom is the only person who knows how to do this.
2640132	eng	Tom is in the living room watching an old movie.
2640133	eng	Tom heard the door open and wondered who it was.
2640134	eng	Tom heard someone knock on the door three times.
2640135	eng	Tom has some very important things he needs to do right now.
2640136	eng	Tom had so many things he wanted to say to Mary.
2640137	eng	Tom got in the car with Mary and they drove off.
2640138	eng	Tom found Mary's diary and read the last three pages.
2640139	eng	Tom flipped the coin and said, "Heads or Tails?"
2640140	eng	Tom doesn't even know how to write his own name.
2640141	eng	Tom didn't remember where he'd put his passport.
2640142	eng	Tom didn't know where the fire extinguisher was.
2640143	eng	Tom closed the curtains before he got undressed.

2640145	eng	Tom and Mary wrote many of their songs together.
2640146	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting in their usual places.
2640147	eng	Tom and Mary walked in silence through the park.
2640148	eng	Tom and Mary walked down the hall, side by side.
2640149	eng	Tom and Mary walked away in opposite directions.
2640150	eng	Tom and Mary seem to be in love with each other.
2640151	eng	Tom and Mary married when they were still young.
2640152	eng	Tom and Mary looked at themselves in the mirror.
2640153	eng	Tom and Mary have only been married three weeks.
2640154	eng	Tom and Mary are taking a break from each other.
2640155	eng	Tom and I haven't seen each other since college.
2640156	eng	Tom and his staff are preparing for the meeting.
2640157	eng	People seem to be treating me differently today.
2640158	eng	Maybe next time you come over I'll cook for you.
2640159	eng	Mary was very beautiful when she was a teenager.
2640160	eng	Mary shaves her legs more often than Alice does.
2640161	eng	It's possible Tom didn't know about the meeting.
2640162	eng	Is Tom wearing the new shirt you bought for him?
2640163	eng	I'll text Tom and see if he wants to go with us.
2640164	eng	I think it's about time for me to get a haircut.
2640165	eng	I have almost three thousand dollars in my safe.
2640166	eng	I have a feeling you and I have a lot in common.
2640167	eng	I doubt that you are as busy as you say you are.
2640168	eng	Are you saying that you don't have enough money?
2640169	eng	You've chosen a nice color paint for your room.
2640170	eng	You're the one who knows how to do this, right?
2640171	eng	You were friends with both Tom and Mary, right?
2640172	eng	You should've tried some of Tom's homemade pie.
2640173	eng	You must have some idea what's going to happen.
2640174	eng	You have three minutes and thirty seconds left.
2640175	eng	You had dinner with Tom last night, didn't you?
2640176	eng	You always said you wanted to become a teacher.
2640177	eng	Why don't you ask Tom to babysit Mary and John?
2640178	eng	We're meeting in an hour in front of the hotel.
2640179	eng	We used to live in Boston when you were a baby.
2640180	eng	We didn't have time to stop at the supermarket.
2640181	eng	Tom will be arriving by train tomorrow evening.
2640182	eng	Tom watched Mary throwing rocks into the water.
2640183	eng	Tom was bitten by a dog when he was a thirteen.
2640184	eng	Tom was asleep in the hammock, snoring quietly.
2640185	eng	Tom was a little surprised that Mary said that.
2640186	eng	Tom wants to ask you about your trip to Boston.
2640187	eng	Tom walked out the door without saying goodbye.
2640188	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't have enough money.
2640189	eng	Tom spoke to Mary for the first time yesterday.
2640190	eng	Tom smuggled something into Australia for Mary.
2640191	eng	Tom seemed really impressed with Mary's speech.
2640192	eng	Tom says that he was here in Boston that night.
2640193	eng	Tom says he was in Boston the week before last.
2640194	eng	Tom saw something in the woods that scared him.
2640195	eng	Tom saw Mary waiting in front of the warehouse.
2640196	eng	Tom picked up the dry cleaning on his way home.
2640197	eng	Tom picked up his clarinet and started to play.
2640198	eng	Tom is the only one here that can speak French.
2640199	eng	Tom heard a noise behind him and turned around.
2640200	eng	Tom grabbed his guitar and headed for the door.
2640201	eng	Tom got into the car and slammed the door shut.
2640202	eng	Tom got blamed even though it wasn't his fault.
2640203	eng	Tom filled the three glasses with orange juice.
2640204	eng	Tom doesn't need to come if he doesn't want to.
2640205	eng	Tom didn't plan on running into anyone he knew.
2640206	eng	Tom didn't mention why he was looking for Mary.
2640207	eng	Tom didn't know what time he needed to show up.
2640208	eng	Tom crossed the road without looking both ways.
2640209	eng	Tom could've figured that out without any help.
2640210	eng	Tom and Mary weren't at home yesterday evening.
2640211	eng	Tom and Mary were the only ones that were left.
2640212	eng	Tom and Mary usually have a good time together.
2640213	eng	Tom and Mary spend a lot of money on their son.
2640214	eng	Tom and Mary sat at opposite ends of the couch.
2640215	eng	Tom and Mary said they wanted to be left alone.
2640216	eng	Tom and Mary looked at each other suspiciously.
2640217	eng	Tom and Mary have been married for three years.
2640218	eng	Tom and Mary grow leaf lettuce in their garden.
2640219	eng	Tom and I were both at John and Mary's wedding.
2640220	eng	Tom and I ate together in the school cafeteria.
2640221	eng	Tom and his teacher were talking to each other.
2640222	eng	This building is about three hundred years old.
2640223	eng	There was a woman here earlier looking for you.
2640224	eng	There has to be a reason why this is happening.
2640225	eng	The police say they know you had an accomplice.
2640226	eng	Please tell Tom everything we want him to know.
2640227	eng	Nobody is in the living room, but the TV is on.
2640228	eng	It's been a long time since I've felt this bad.
2640229	eng	I've been thinking about going to Boston again.
2640230	eng	I'll be here in the morning if anyone needs me.
2640231	eng	I want to thank you for everything you've done.
2640232	eng	I told Tom that the party wouldn't be much fun.
2640233	eng	I think you were better looking with long hair.
2640234	eng	I think we picked the wrong person for the job.
2640235	eng	I missed the first thirty minutes of the movie.
2640236	eng	I had no idea there'd be this many people here.
2640237	eng	Do you remember the day this picture was taken?
2640238	eng	Do you have any idea when Tom plans to be here?
2640239	eng	Did you find any fingerprints on the wineglass?
2640240	eng	Did that really cost you three hundred dollars?
2640241	eng	Are you sure Tom didn't pick Mary up at school?
2640242	eng	You're wearing the clothes you wore yesterday.
2640243	eng	You're the first woman I've ever really loved.
2640244	eng	You'll feel better after a good night's sleep.
2640245	eng	You seem to remember everything that happened.
2640246	eng	You don't believe everything you hear, do you?
2640247	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom wear a tie?
2640248	eng	We have very little time, so listen carefully.
2640249	eng	We have more important things to do right now.
2640250	eng	We have a few more hours before Tom gets here.
2640251	eng	We had a lot of fun together today, didn't we?
2640252	eng	Tom was a little surprised by Mary's behavior.
2640253	eng	Tom turned off the lights and closed the door.
2640254	eng	Tom told me you were with my son when he died.

2640291	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting for you in the lobby.
2640292	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting at the park entrance.
2640293	eng	Tom and Mary are getting married next weekend.
2640294	eng	There were some muddy footprints on the floor.
2640295	eng	The meeting started at 2:30 and ended at 5:00.
2640296	eng	The bartender told me you were a regular here.
2640297	eng	Tell Tom that he needs to wear a tie tomorrow.
2640298	eng	Smoking is prohibited in all public buildings.
2640299	eng	It's unusual for it to snow this time of year.
2640300	eng	It was a pity Tom couldn't go camping with us.
2640301	eng	I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom comes.
2640302	eng	I'm not the only one who wants to leave early.
2640303	eng	I should probably just toss this in the trash.
2640304	eng	I plan to leave as soon as I finish this beer.
2640305	eng	I need you to help me take care of Tom's kids.
2640306	eng	I guess you have your reasons for being angry.
2640307	eng	I asked Tom if he wanted to go and he said no.
2640308	eng	How many times have I told you not to do that?
2640309	eng	Have you noticed anything out of the ordinary?
2640310	eng	Did Tom say why he wanted to borrow the truck?
2640311	eng	Are you going to wear that dress to the party?
2640312	eng	Are you coming to pick me up tomorrow morning?
2640313	eng	You've never cared about anyone but yourself.
2640314	eng	You're the most beautiful woman in the world.
2640315	eng	You know what Tom said about Mary, don't you?
2640316	eng	You don't need to worry about that happening.
2640317	eng	You and Tom were happy together, weren't you?
2640318	eng	You always said you wanted to live in Boston.
2640319	eng	Without your help, Tom doesn't have a chance.
2640320	eng	Why wasn't anything about that in the report?
2640321	eng	Why don't you believe me when I say I'm busy?
2640322	eng	Where were you on the night Tom was murdered?
2640323	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom at school?

2640342	eng	Tom said he doesn't know Mary's phone number.
2640343	eng	Tom said he doesn't know how to speak French.
2640344	eng	Tom picked up a napkin and wiped Mary's chin.
2640345	eng	Tom never drinks coffee this late in the day.
2640346	eng	Tom loves us all, but he loves Mary the most.
2640347	eng	Tom knocked on the door, but got no response.
2640348	eng	Tom knocked on the door and Mary answered it.
2640349	eng	Tom knew Mary could speak French fairly well.
2640350	eng	Tom has said some very good things about you.
2640351	eng	Tom grabbed his coat and headed for the door.
2640352	eng	Tom gave the impression that he wasn't happy.
2640353	eng	Tom felt it was important that you know this.
2640354	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand what we meant.

2640368	eng	They're not drunk, but they've been drinking.
2640369	eng	There's one thing you need to know about Tom.
2640370	eng	The man on the floor had a knife in his back.
2640371	eng	The maid asked if we wanted the room cleaned.
2640372	eng	That's the last thing I want to do right now.
2640373	eng	One of the boys stood up and started yelling.
2640374	eng	None of Tom's classmates offered to help him.
2640375	eng	My flight was supposed to arrive at 2:30 p.m.
2640376	eng	It's nice to just sit here and talk with you.
2640377	eng	It's been suggested that we need to help Tom.
2640378	eng	It would be a mistake to ignore Tom's advice.
2640379	eng	It has to be Tom who tells Mary she can't go.
2640380	eng	Is it true that Tom jumped in front of a bus?
2640381	eng	In my opinion, Tom's the guy we need to hire.
2640382	eng	If you need help, all you have to do is call.
2640383	eng	I'm worried about what'll happen if Tom wins.
2640384	eng	I'm a little worried about what might happen.
2640385	eng	I'll be here in my office if anyone needs me.
2640386	eng	I'd like to spend some time with my daughter.
2640388	eng	I think you hate Tom as much as he hates you.
2640389	eng	I remember you when you were about this high.
2640390	eng	I know how busy you're likely to be tomorrow.
2640391	eng	I had no idea you could speak French so well.
2640392	eng	I can't believe it's already time to go home.
2640393	eng	Have you ever seen anything like this before?
2640394	eng	Did you buy everything we need for our party?
2640395	eng	According to Tom, you weren't in class today.
2640396	eng	You've never been as busy as I am right now.
2640397	eng	You'll never know how much this means to me.
2640398	eng	You said you were thirty and I believed you.
2640399	eng	You need to learn how to change spark plugs.
2640400	eng	Who picked out those clothes you're wearing?
2640401	eng	Where were you on the night of October 20th?
2640402	eng	We know it was you that took Tom's umbrella.

2640412	eng	Tom was asleep on the couch, snoring loudly.
2640413	eng	Tom was angry because Mary was ignoring him.
2640414	eng	Tom wants to ask you to come over to dinner.
2640415	eng	Tom walked up to the door and rang the bell.
2640416	eng	Tom tried the knob, but the door was locked.
2640417	eng	Tom tossed the flowers into the garbage can.

2640437	eng	Tom has a couple of interesting suggestions.
2640438	eng	Tom got into the car and started the engine.
2640439	eng	Tom found the key that he thought he'd lost.
2640440	eng	Tom didn't need to use the knife I lent him.
2640441	eng	Tom didn't mention anything about the party.

2640466	eng	Tom and I both didn't go to today's meeting.
2640467	eng	There has to be more to the story than that.
2640468	eng	That doesn't leave me with a lot of options.
2640469	eng	One of my classmates used to live in Boston.
2640470	eng	None of Tom's classmates knew his last name.
2640471	eng	It's not easy for Tom to get off work early.
2640472	eng	It's not a good idea to pick up hitchhikers.
2640473	eng	It's great to see you're having so much fun.
2640474	eng	It was hard for Tom to keep a straight face.
2640475	eng	I'll be here all morning if anyone needs me.
2640476	eng	I thought you'd be busy cleaning your house.
2640477	eng	I saw Tom here in the park just a while ago.
2640478	eng	I guess they really weren't all that hungry.
2640479	eng	I finished reading this novel in three days.

2640488	eng	All you have to do is sit here and be quiet.

2640492	eng	You'll feel better after you eat something.
2640493	eng	You won't be busy this afternoon, will you?
2640494	eng	You know how serious things are, don't you?

2640564	eng	It seems that Tom is busy with his new job.
2640565	eng	If you have something to say to me, say it.

2640622	eng	Tom only seems to be busy in the morning.
2640623	eng	Tom made me promise not to go there again.
2640624	eng	Tom jotted down something in his notebook.
2640625	eng	Tom isn't the only one here that can swim.
2640626	eng	Tom is probably not very hungry right now.
2640627	eng	Tom is paying the saleslady for something.
2640628	eng	Tom had some questions he needed answered.
2640629	eng	Tom had more important things on his mind.
2640630	eng	Tom got up and headed toward the backdoor.

2641217	eng	You're not the only one who's hungry.
2641218	eng	You're not the only one who's afraid.

2641227	eng	You need to be here by 2:30 tomorrow.
2641228	eng	You knew Tom was leaving, didn't you?

2641728	eng	The policeman showed Tom his badge.
2641729	eng	The movie starts in thirty minutes.
2641730	eng	Something's on your mind, isn't it?
2641731	eng	Something in the sky caught my eye.
2641732	eng	None of Tom's classmates liked him.
2641733	eng	Let's discuss this at another time.
2641734	eng	It looked like you were in a hurry.
2641735	eng	If I do that, Tom will laugh at me.
2641736	eng	I'm probably going to be busy soon.
2641737	eng	I was wondering why you came early.
2641738	eng	I understand this used to be Tom's.
2641739	eng	I thought you'd decided against it.
2641740	eng	I thought Tom and Mary were hungry.
2641741	eng	I still want to hear Tom's opinion.
2641742	eng	I need to know that somebody cares.
2641743	eng	I know where Tom went last weekend.
2641744	eng	I hope Tom doesn't change his mind.
2641745	eng	I have more important things to do.
2641746	eng	I have everything here that I need.
2641747	eng	I guess they really weren't hungry.
2641748	eng	I don't even know where Tom is now.
2641749	eng	How long have you two been engaged?
2641750	eng	Here's the book you wanted to read.
2641751	eng	Have you received Tom's invitation?
2641752	eng	Has Tom received an invitation yet?
2641753	eng	Everyone seems to be hungry but me.
2641754	eng	Do you remember all of their names?
2641755	eng	Do you really care what they think?
2641756	eng	Do you know what this means for us?
2641757	eng	Do you know someone we could trust?
2641758	eng	Do you have enough time to do that?
2641759	eng	Be a little more careful next time.
2641760	eng	Are you planning on buying a house?
2641761	eng	Your thirty minutes are almost up.
2641762	eng	Your fingerprints were on the gun.
2641763	eng	Your birthday is the same as mine.
2641764	eng	You're not the only one Tom asked.
2641765	eng	You're not answering the question.
2641766	eng	You'll never guess who I just met.
2641767	eng	You'll feel better in the morning.
2641768	eng	You'll be busy tomorrow afternoon.
2641769	eng	You were very hungry, weren't you?
2641770	eng	You seem really busy this morning.
2641771	eng	You said you could play the piano.
2641772	eng	You said the same thing about Tom.
2641773	eng	You never admitted you were wrong.
2641774	eng	You have thirty minutes to decide.
2641775	eng	Why were you in that neighborhood?
2641776	eng	Why is there sawdust on the floor?
2641777	eng	Why are you wearing those clothes?
2641778	eng	Where did you pick up that accent?
2641779	eng	What're you doing in my apartment?
2641780	eng	What were Tom and Mary doing here?
2641781	eng	What was Tom wearing when he died?
2641782	eng	What Tom and Mary had was special.
2641783	eng	What time, exactly, did Tom leave?
2641784	eng	What does this machine do exactly?
2641785	eng	What does this have to do with us?
2641786	eng	What does this have to do with me?
2641787	eng	What does that have to do with us?
2641788	eng	What does that have to do with it?
2641789	eng	What did you say these are called?
2641790	eng	We're three hours from the border.
2641791	eng	We're not the only Canadians here.
2641792	eng	We're not so different, you and I.
2641793	eng	We're meeting to discuss strategy.
2641794	eng	We're meeting at my place at 2:30.
2641795	eng	We'll be there before you know it.
2641796	eng	We'll all be dead in thirty years.
2641797	eng	We thought you were untrustworthy.
2641798	eng	We should've listened to you, Tom.
2641799	eng	We played on the same soccer team.
2641800	eng	We have things we need to discuss.
2641801	eng	We don't want to start any rumors.
2641802	eng	Tom, could I have a word with you?
2641803	eng	Tom worked for almost three hours.
2641804	eng	Tom won't come to today's meeting.
2641805	eng	Tom will find out sooner or later.
2641806	eng	Tom went into the conference room.
2641807	eng	Tom was the only one not laughing.
2641808	eng	Tom was the only one in the house.
2641809	eng	Tom was surprised and embarrassed.
2641810	eng	Tom was satisfied with the result.
2641811	eng	Tom was one of my better students.
2641812	eng	Tom was never the same after that.
2641813	eng	Tom was my daughter's best friend.
2641814	eng	Tom was in the pool swimming laps.
2641815	eng	Tom was in his office all morning.
2641816	eng	Tom was here earlier this morning.
2641817	eng	Tom was here earlier this evening.
2641818	eng	Tom was beginning to feel ignored.
2641819	eng	Tom was beginning to feel awkward.
2641820	eng	Tom wanted to know where Mary was.
2641821	eng	Tom walked over to where Mary was.
2641822	eng	Tom walked Mary to the front door.
2641823	eng	Tom walked down into the basement.
2641824	eng	Tom tried his best to ignore Mary.
2641826	eng	Tom took the knife away from Mary.
2641827	eng	Tom took control of the situation.
2641828	eng	Tom took a twenty from his pocket.
2641829	eng	Tom thought we should leave early.
2641830	eng	Tom thinks it's a ridiculous idea.
2641831	eng	Tom started the car and drove off.
2641832	eng	Tom started asking some questions.
2641833	eng	Tom squatted down next to his dog.
2641834	eng	Tom sometimes sleeps on the floor.

2641837	eng	Tom seemed to have been very busy.
2641838	eng	Tom seemed to be worried about me.
2641839	eng	Tom says he feels a little better.
2641840	eng	Tom saw something in the distance.
2641841	eng	Tom sat on the grass next to Mary.
2641842	eng	Tom sat on a bench reading a book.
2641843	eng	Tom sat next to Mary on the couch.

2641847	eng	Tom said you'd be able to help me.
2641848	eng	Tom said you said it was OK to go.
2641849	eng	Tom said he was in love with Mary.
2641850	eng	Tom said he needed some more time.
2641851	eng	Tom remained outside on the porch.
2641852	eng	Tom reluctantly accepted the gift.
2641853	eng	Tom put some flowers on the table.
2641854	eng	Tom pushed Mary into the elevator.
2641855	eng	Tom probably isn't busy right now.
2641856	eng	Tom picked up one of the pictures.
2641857	eng	Tom opened the door to his office.
2641858	eng	Tom opened his mouth to interrupt.
2641859	eng	Tom never was very good at French.
2641860	eng	Tom never knew Mary felt that way.
2641861	eng	Tom must care about you very much.
2641862	eng	Tom may be back sometime tomorrow.
2641863	eng	Tom made Mary tell him everything.
2641864	eng	Tom loved Mary and Mary loved him.

2641891	eng	Tom feels a little sorry for Mary.
2641892	eng	Tom explained the problem to Mary.
2641893	eng	Tom eats more ice cream than I do.
2641894	eng	Tom doesn't smile so much anymore.

2641949	eng	They all have one thing in common.
2641950	eng	There's something very wrong here.
2641951	eng	The less you know, the better, OK?
2641952	eng	Thank you for the beautiful roses.
2641953	eng	Tell me about what you do for fun.
2641954	eng	Sometimes you're so unimaginative.
2641955	eng	Send it to the address I gave you.
2641956	eng	Prepare yourself for a shock, Tom.

2641958	eng	Most men here wear ties every day.
2641959	eng	Mary is wearing a new dress today.
2641960	eng	Mary is beautiful and intelligent.
2641961	eng	It's too dark here to read a book.
2641962	eng	It would be sad if that were true.
2641963	eng	It wasn't Tom's idea. It was mine.

2642504	eng	You'll be answering the phones.
2642505	eng	You weren't deceived, were you?
2642506	eng	You were never good at drawing.
2642507	eng	You two look so happy together.
2642508	eng	You should at least wear a tie.
2642509	eng	You said that half an hour ago.
2642510	eng	You now have my full attention.
2642511	eng	You never answered my question.
2642512	eng	You need someone you can trust.

2642544	eng	We're glad to have you with us.

2642546	eng	We were all at school together.
2642547	eng	We need to know more about Tom.
2642548	eng	We know that Tom was strangled.
2642549	eng	We have room for thirty people.

2642584	eng	Tom still doesn't look so good.
2642585	eng	Tom started working right away.
2642586	eng	Tom started earlier than I did.
2642587	eng	Tom spent all day on the beach.
2642588	eng	Tom slipped off his headphones.

2642610	eng	Tom reluctantly took his seats.
2642611	eng	Tom recognized Mary right away.

2642613	eng	Tom put the knife on the table.
2642614	eng	Tom put his bag on Mary's desk.
2642615	eng	Tom probably doesn't like Mary.

2642731	eng	Tom and I are here to help you.
2642732	eng	Tom already gave me permission.
2642733	eng	This kind of work wears me out.
2642734	eng	This is Mary, my ex-girlfriend.
2642735	eng	This coffee tastes really good.
2642736	eng	They're your friends, not mine.
2642737	eng	They'll be here in ten minutes.
2642738	eng	They knew what they were doing.
2642739	eng	They have everything they need.
2642740	eng	There has to be an explanation.
2642741	eng	The movie wasn't all that good.
2642742	eng	The less Tom knows, the better.

2642754	eng	It's yours for the asking, Tom.
2642755	eng	It's time you got back to work.
2642756	eng	It's hard to believe, isn't it?
2642757	eng	It wasn't your fault, you know.

2642790	eng	You're a very beautiful woman.
2642791	eng	You'll feel better in no time.

2642801	eng	You need to be more attentive.
2642802	eng	You need a good night's sleep.
2642803	eng	You must be a friend of Tom's.

2642805	eng	You can eat anything you want.
2642806	eng	You can buy anything you want.
2642807	eng	You always were a good dancer.

2643342	eng	Tom agreed to think about it.
2643343	eng	This place is nice and quiet.
2643344	eng	This isn't your place, is it?
2643345	eng	This is Tom's idea, isn't it?
2643346	eng	This is Tom, my ex-boyfriend.
2643347	eng	This is my daughter's school.
2643348	eng	They said it was an accident.
2643349	eng	They need you at the meeting.

2643351	eng	The soccer tryouts are today.
2643352	eng	The lights are on downstairs.
2643353	eng	The food hasn't been touched.
2643354	eng	That sounds like Tom's voice.
2643355	eng	Thanks for the encouragement.
2643356	eng	Thank you for the suggestion.
2643357	eng	Tell them that they're wrong.
2643358	eng	Technically, you are correct.
2643359	eng	Somebody had to do something.
2643360	eng	Promise me you won't be late.
2643361	eng	One of them was Tom's friend.
2643362	eng	One of the lions has escaped.
2643363	eng	Maybe you shouldn't eat that.
2643364	eng	Maybe you didn't do it right.

2643372	eng	It was the wrong thing to do.
2643373	eng	It was the right thing to do.
2643374	eng	It seemed like you were busy.
2643375	eng	I've never seen them so busy.
2643376	eng	I'm sure everything'll be OK.
2643377	eng	I'm really not all that busy.
2643378	eng	I'll check in with you later.

2643384	eng	I need to know what that was.
2643385	eng	I met Tom at the coffee shop.
2643386	eng	I know that Tom isn't hungry.
2643387	eng	I don't find that very funny.

2643389	eng	Hey Tom, isn't that your cat?
2643390	eng	Have you ever seen Tom dance?

2643398	eng	Do you want to do this later?
2643399	eng	Do you want to do that again?
2643400	eng	Do you want a glass of water?
2643401	eng	Do you really hate that idea?
2643402	eng	Do you have a recommendation?
2643403	eng	Do we really have to do that?
2643404	eng	Did Tom say when he'd arrive?
2643405	eng	Couldn't Tom have been lying?
2643406	eng	Consider yourselves hostages.
2643407	eng	Consider this a warning, Tom.
2643408	eng	Can I help you with anything?
2643409	eng	Are you saying Tom is a liar?
2643410	eng	Are you going to pay in cash?
2643411	eng	Are you coming to pick me up?
2643412	eng	Your T-shirt's on backwards.
2643413	eng	Your sweater's on backwards.
2643414	eng	You're wanted by the police.
2643415	eng	You're thirty minutes early.
2643416	eng	You're the person in charge.
2643417	eng	You're not that interesting.
2643418	eng	You're needed in the clinic.
2643419	eng	You're asking the wrong guy.
2643420	eng	You're all busy, aren't you?
2643421	eng	You'll be the first to know.
2643422	eng	You'd better not drink that.
2643423	eng	You'd better listen to this.
2643424	eng	You were never good at math.
2643425	eng	You were happy, weren't you?
2643426	eng	You seem to be way too busy.
2643427	eng	You said you were concerned.
2643428	eng	You said you wanted to know.
2643429	eng	You said you needed a favor.
2643430	eng	You said you had a question.
2643431	eng	You said you had a contract.
2643432	eng	You said that you were busy.
2643433	eng	You said that Tom was alive.
2643434	eng	You picked the wrong person.
2643435	eng	You people are unbelievable.

2643443	eng	You hate small towns, right?
2643444	eng	You had us a little worried.
2643445	eng	You had no right to do that.
2643446	eng	You always were an optimist.
2643447	eng	You always were a good cook.
2643448	eng	Why did you say that to Tom?
2643449	eng	Why did you have to do that?
2643450	eng	Why did they do this to you?
2643451	eng	Why are you wearing my coat?
2643452	eng	Why are you procrastinating?
2643453	eng	Why are you in your pajamas?
2643454	eng	Why are you doing this here?
2643455	eng	Where were you this morning?
2643456	eng	Where have you been, anyway?
2643457	eng	What're you looking at, Tom?

2643480	eng	We had a little car trouble.
2643481	eng	We don't need anything else.
2643482	eng	We decided to stay with Tom.
2643483	eng	We became very good friends.
2643484	eng	We aren't yet out of danger.
2643485	eng	We almost had Tom convinced.
2643486	eng	We almost got there on time.
2643487	eng	We all care for one another.

2643686	eng	Tom and I were both invited.
2643687	eng	Tom and I traveled together.
2643688	eng	Tom and I have fun together.
2643689	eng	Tom and I both speak French.
2643690	eng	Tom and I both like sailing.
2643691	eng	Tom and I are both to blame.
2643692	eng	Tom and I are both teachers.
2643693	eng	Tom almost bumped into Mary.
2643694	eng	This is our fault, isn't it?
2643695	eng	They're thirty dollars each.
2643696	eng	They're now in Tom's office.
2643697	eng	They'll be here soon enough.
2643698	eng	They were all good swimmers.
2643699	eng	They said they were leaving.
2643700	eng	They had no idea what to do.
2643701	eng	These are your instructions.
2643702	eng	There'll have to be changes.
2643703	eng	The car's almost out of gas.
2643704	eng	That's your favorite, right?
2643705	eng	That would be my suggestion.
2643706	eng	That wasn't on the schedule.
2643707	eng	That was Tom on the phone.
2643708	eng	Thanks for your cooperation.
2643709	eng	Thank you for your courtesy.
2643710	eng	Thank you for understanding.
2643711	eng	Thank you for picking me up.
2643712	eng	Shouldn't that be my choice?

2643714	eng	Put the broom in the closet.
2643715	eng	Put another log on the fire.
2643716	eng	Pull yourself together, Tom.
2643717	eng	Our class has just finished.
2643718	eng	None of them wanted to talk.
2643719	eng	My room has only one window.
2643720	eng	Maybe we should wear gloves.
2643721	eng	Maybe I've been misinformed.
2643722	eng	Mary wiped off her lipstick.
2643723	eng	It's almost time to go home.
2643724	eng	It's a great day for a hike.
2643725	eng	It was your idea, wasn't it?
2643726	eng	It looks like my job's done.
2643727	eng	I've never seen you so busy.
2643728	eng	I've never seen Tom so busy.
2643729	eng	I'm starting to feel better.
2643730	eng	I'm not very busy right now.
2643731	eng	I wonder why Tom isn't busy.
2643732	eng	I wonder why Tom is so busy.
2643733	eng	I told Tom to wear sunblock.

2643735	eng	I thought Tom would be busy.
2643736	eng	I thought Tom wasn't hungry.
2643737	eng	I thought everyone was busy.
2643738	eng	I think Tom has been crying.
2643739	eng	I think this room is bugged.
2643740	eng	I spoke to Tom this morning.
2643741	eng	I said it wasn't your fault.
2643742	eng	I really am getting married.
2643743	eng	I need to check my schedule.
2643744	eng	I know why Tom quit his job.
2643745	eng	I knew that Tom wasn't busy.
2643746	eng	I knew it was a possibility.
2643747	eng	I just saw Tom driving away.
2643748	eng	I hope Tom changes his mind.
2643749	eng	I heard you had an accident.
2643750	eng	I heard everything Tom said.
2643751	eng	I hear you have jobs for us.
2643752	eng	I hardly ever ask questions.
2643753	eng	I figured everyone was busy.
2643754	eng	I don't often ask questions.
2643755	eng	I assumed you might be busy.
2643756	eng	How much does a ticket cost?
2643757	eng	Haven't you had enough, Tom?
2643758	eng	Have you been to the police?
2643759	eng	Has Tom ever threatened you?
2643760	eng	Hardly anybody's busy today.
2643761	eng	Give Tom something to drink.
2643762	eng	Enjoy yourself for a change.
2643763	eng	Don't you have a girlfriend?
2643764	eng	Do you want some more bacon?
2643765	eng	Do you know that for a fact?
2643766	eng	Do you have my money or not?
2643767	eng	Do you care what they think?
2643768	eng	Did you get your money back?
2643769	eng	Did Tom do well on the exam?
2643770	eng	Congratulations to you both.
2643771	eng	Carry on with your business.
2643772	eng	Brace yourselves for impact.
2643773	eng	Are you sure we haven't met?
2643774	eng	Are you claustrophobic, too?
2643775	eng	Are we forgetting something?
2643776	eng	All you have to do is smile.
2643777	eng	All they had to do was stop.
2643778	eng	Your thirty minutes are up.
2643779	eng	You're supposed to be busy.
2643780	eng	You're so wrong about that.
2643781	eng	You're not hungry, are you?
2643782	eng	You're not fooling anybody.
2643783	eng	You're needed at once, Tom.
2643784	eng	You're my best friend, Tom.
2643785	eng	You're jealous, aren't you?
2643786	eng	You'd better ask Tom first.
2643787	eng	You were flirting with Tom.
2643788	eng	You were busy, weren't you?
2643789	eng	You should've had some pie.
2643790	eng	You said you were finished.

2643817	eng	Who was driving the hearse?
2643818	eng	Who isn't wearing lipstick?
2643819	eng	Where have you been living?
2643820	eng	Where have you been hiding?

2643852	eng	We were having an argument.
2643853	eng	We were having a good time.
2643854	eng	We were all wearing gloves.
2643855	eng	We should lower our voices.

2644519	eng	Put on your seatbelt, Tom.
2644520	eng	Perhaps Tom had it coming.
2644521	eng	Nobody was busy except me.
2644522	eng	Mary was Tom's first wife.
2644523	eng	Mary put on some lipstick.
2644524	eng	Mary is now my girlfriend.
2644525	eng	Mary is an old girlfriend.

2644535	eng	It all happened very fast.
2644536	eng	Is it your birthday today?
2644537	eng	I've never met Tom's wife.

2644542	eng	I'm glad to be of service.
2644543	eng	I'll help you in a minute.
2644544	eng	I wasn't very busy anyway.
2644545	eng	I was kicked off the team.
2644546	eng	I used to love this place.
2644547	eng	I told you Tom was hungry.
2644548	eng	I thought you'd be hungry.
2644549	eng	I thought you had to work.

2644591	eng	Did you do that purposely?
2644592	eng	Could you babysit my boys?
2644593	eng	Could Tom have been there?
2644594	eng	Come on, pick up the pace.
2644595	eng	Both of them are confused.
2644596	eng	Are you the only one here?
2644597	eng	Are you doing this for me?
2644598	eng	Are you doing that for me?
2644599	eng	Are we done with this job?
2644600	eng	Are they keeping you busy?

2644612	eng	You'll never change, Tom.
2644613	eng	You'll need a flashlight.
2644614	eng	You'll meet Tom tomorrow.
2644615	eng	You'd better have a plan.
2644616	eng	You were right, you know.
2644617	eng	You were a teenager then.

2644640	eng	You don't seem too happy.
2644641	eng	You don't seem so hungry.
2644642	eng	You don't look very busy.
2644643	eng	You and Tom must be busy.
2644644	eng	You almost sat on my hat.
2644645	eng	Wouldn't that be a shame?
2644646	eng	Would you say that again?
2644647	eng	Would you really do that?
2644648	eng	Would you like more wine?

2645348	eng	Tom isn't a nice person.
2645349	eng	Tom is worried about me.
2645350	eng	Tom is wearing a tuxedo.
2645351	eng	Tom is very worried now.
2645352	eng	Tom is twice Mary's age.
2645353	eng	Tom is the one you want.
2645354	eng	Tom is the one to blame.
2645355	eng	Tom is still frustrated.

2645376	eng	Tom got another message.
2645377	eng	Tom follows Mary around.
2645378	eng	Tom followed after Mary.
2645379	eng	Tom finished the dishes.
2645380	eng	Tom finally believes us.
2645381	eng	Tom felt Mary's forehead.
2645382	eng	Tom felt a little dazed.
2645383	eng	Tom fell into the water.
2645384	eng	Tom examined it closely.
2645385	eng	Tom ducked Mary's punch.

2645398	eng	Tom cracked up laughing.
2645399	eng	Tom couldn't protect me.
2645400	eng	Tom could've killed you.
2645401	eng	Tom could've been lying.
2645402	eng	Tom continued his story.
2645403	eng	Tom closed his textbook.
2645404	eng	Tom climbed up the hill.

2645410	eng	Tom came home yesterday.
2645411	eng	Tom called this morning.

2645431	eng	Tom and I are very busy.
2645432	eng	Tom and I are both busy.
2645433	eng	This wasn't Tom's fault.
2645434	eng	This was your idea, Tom.
2645435	eng	This package is for you.
2645436	eng	This isn't for you, Tom.
2645437	eng	This is Tom's handiwork.
2645438	eng	They're friends of mine.
2645439	eng	They said Mary was dead.
2645440	eng	They said it was creepy.
2645441	eng	They never listen to me.
2645442	eng	They needed one another.
2645443	eng	They looked really busy.
2645444	eng	They have their reasons.
2645445	eng	They could be listening.
2645446	eng	These were in my drawer.
2645447	eng	These are your quarters.
2645448	eng	These are Tom's glasses.
2645449	eng	These are Tom's friends.
2645450	eng	The keys were in my bag.
2645451	eng	The guns weren't loaded.
2645452	eng	The doctor's on his way.
2645453	eng	The children are asleep.
2645454	eng	That's a beautiful song.
2645455	eng	That wasn't on the list.
2645456	eng	That wasn't my question.
2645457	eng	Thanks for your support.

2645463	eng	Thanks for calling, Tom.
2645464	eng	Thank you for your work.
2645465	eng	Don't you think we should let Tom try doing that again?
2645466	eng	Thank you for this, Tom.
2645467	eng	Thank you for breakfast.

2645473	eng	Put this in your pocket.
2645474	eng	Please have a seat, Tom.
2645475	eng	Place your bets, please.
2645476	eng	Perhaps Tom is sleeping.
2645477	eng	Order has been restored.
2645478	eng	Nothing's wrong with me.
2645479	eng	None of them were right.
2645480	eng	Nobody's as fast as you.
2645481	eng	Nobody did that with me.
2645482	eng	My father was a teacher.
2645483	eng	Maybe you were followed.
2645484	eng	Maybe Tom wasn't hungry.
2645485	eng	Lunch wasn't that great.
2645486	eng	It's time to wrap it up.
2645487	eng	It's time to go to work.
2645488	eng	It's time for you to go.
2645489	eng	It's my fault, you know.
2645490	eng	It's in your hands, Tom.
2645491	eng	It was Tom's, wasn't it?
2645492	eng	It seems Tom knows Mary.
2645493	eng	Isn't that correct, Tom?
2645494	eng	Is this your girlfriend?
2645495	eng	Is that your girlfriend?
2645496	eng	I've got to go meet Tom.
2645497	eng	I'm still a little busy.
2645498	eng	I'm not at all busy now.
2645499	eng	I'll follow your advice.
2645500	eng	I told you Tom was fast.
2645501	eng	I told you Tom was busy.
2645502	eng	I told you I'm not busy.
2645503	eng	I thought you'd be busy.
2645504	eng	I thought you were busy.
2645505	eng	I never wanted Tom here.
2645506	eng	I know you must be busy.
2645507	eng	I know why Tom resigned.
2645508	eng	I know Tom isn't hungry.
2645509	eng	I have so much to learn.
2645510	eng	I forgot to wear a belt.
2645511	eng	I don't intend to do so.
2645512	eng	I assumed you were busy.
2645513	eng	How've you been feeling?
2645514	eng	How's Tom doing at work?
2645515	eng	How're you this morning?
2645516	eng	How was your conference?
2645517	eng	How have you been doing?
2645518	eng	How do you do that, Tom?
2645519	eng	How do they communicate?
2645520	eng	How did the fight start?
2645521	eng	How are they doing this?
2645522	eng	Haven't you done enough?
2645523	eng	Have you eaten anything?
2645524	eng	Have you been listening?
2645525	eng	Have they said anything?
2645526	eng	Has Tom transferred yet?
2645527	eng	Give us a demonstration.
2645528	eng	Give me a demonstration.
2645529	eng	Get on with your duties.
2645530	eng	Everyone will be hungry.
2645531	eng	Does Tom have a license?
2645532	eng	Do you want us to leave?
2645533	eng	Do you want some dinner?
2645534	eng	Do you remember my name?
2645535	eng	Do you have the picture?
2645536	eng	Do you have it with you?
2645537	eng	Do we have an agreement?
2645538	eng	Did you have to do that?
2645539	eng	Did Tom have his dinner?
2645540	eng	Could it be that simple?
2645541	eng	Come in quickly, please.
2645542	eng	Can you help us tonight?
2645543	eng	Can you do that, please?
2645544	eng	Can you babysit my boys?
2645545	eng	Both of them are hungry.
2645546	eng	Aren't you a sweetheart?
2645547	eng	Are you with the police?
2645548	eng	Are you wearing perfume?
2645549	eng	Are you in a fraternity?
2645550	eng	Are you fully recovered?
2645551	eng	Are you from the police?
2645552	eng	Are you frightened, Tom?
2645553	eng	Are you being sarcastic?
2645554	eng	Are you a freshman, too?
2645555	eng	Are these your children?
2645556	eng	Add my name to the list.
2645557	eng	A lot of kids wear them.
2645558	eng	You've had your chance.
2645559	eng	You've had a good year.
2645560	eng	You've always hated me.
2645561	eng	You're three days late.
2645562	eng	You're not wanted here.
2645563	eng	You'll need this again.
2645564	eng	You'll be needing this.
2645565	eng	You were scared, right?
2645566	eng	You were never my type.
2645567	eng	You were at my wedding.
2645568	eng	You were almost killed.
2645569	eng	You were a good mother.
2645570	eng	You two must be hungry.
2645571	eng	You two are ridiculous.
2645572	eng	You said you were done.
2645573	eng	You said you were busy.
2645574	eng	You said you wanted it.
2645575	eng	You said you loved Tom.
2645576	eng	You said nothing wrong.
2645577	eng	You said it was urgent.
2645578	eng	You need patience, Tom.
2645579	eng	You need my permission.
2645580	eng	You must feel horrible.
2645581	eng	You must be very proud.
2645582	eng	You must be kidding me.
2645583	eng	You know Tom was right.
2645584	eng	You have to believe us.
2645585	eng	You have to believe me.
2645586	eng	You have three choices.
2645587	eng	You have my word on it.
2645588	eng	You have a nice family.
2645589	eng	You don't seem so busy.
2645590	eng	You could be in danger.
2645591	eng	You could at least try.
2645592	eng	You always surprise me.
2645593	eng	Yeah, isn't that great?
2645594	eng	Wouldn't they be happy?
2645595	eng	Would you do it for us?
2645596	eng	Would that be possible?
2645597	eng	Will you wash my shirt?
2645598	eng	Why weren't they there?
2645599	eng	Why were you in prison?
2645600	eng	Why were you in my car?
2645601	eng	Why were you in Boston?

2645605	eng	Why haven't you called?
2645606	eng	Why have you done this?
2645607	eng	Why don't you go there?
2645608	eng	Why don't we rest here?
2645609	eng	Why aren't you working?
2645610	eng	Why aren't you with me?
2645611	eng	Why aren't you smiling?
2645612	eng	Why aren't you married?
2645613	eng	Why aren't you in jail?
2645614	eng	Why aren't you helping?
2645615	eng	Why aren't you dressed?

2645695	eng	We had no other option.
2645696	eng	We had no other choice.
2645697	eng	We had coffee together.
2645698	eng	We could've helped Tom.
2645699	eng	We all became soldiers.
2645700	eng	Wasn't Tom in his room?
2645701	eng	Was Tom at the funeral?
2645702	eng	Was that what Tom said?
2645703	eng	Was that an invitation?
2645704	eng	Was that a coincidence?
2645705	eng	Was I really that busy?
2645706	eng	Tom's not feeling well.
2645707	eng	Tom worked really hard.
2645708	eng	Tom will meet me later.

2645731	eng	Tom was my friend, too.
2645732	eng	Tom was my best friend.
2645733	eng	Tom was looking at you.
2645734	eng	Tom was in the service.

2662609	eng	Have you ever dealt with this kind of a problem before?
2662610	eng	What's the problem with me going there instead of you?
2662611	eng	We don't want your parents thinking there's a problem.
2662612	eng	We do have a problem, but it's not one we can't solve.
2662613	eng	Tom needed someone he could discuss his problems with.
2662614	eng	Tom is now middle age and has serious health problems.
2662615	eng	This is always going to be a problem for us, isn't it?
2662616	eng	The problem is everybody's too afraid to speak to Tom.
2662617	eng	That's a problem we have to solve as soon as possible.
2662618	eng	Just be thankful you don't have all of Tom's problems.
2662619	eng	If there had been a problem, we'd have heard about it.
2662620	eng	If I'm not mistaken, the problem is we are out of gas.
2662621	eng	I'm sure if there was a problem, he would have called.
2662622	eng	Could you possibly suggest a way to solve the problem?
2662623	eng	Are there any other problems that need taking care of?
2662624	eng	All our problems would go away if we just ignore them.
2662625	eng	We need to hire someone to take care of this problem.
2662626	eng	Tom doesn't have any problem he can't handle himself.
2662627	eng	The problem is that Tom thinks he's better than Mary.
2662628	eng	The problem is I still don't know if I can trust you.
2662629	eng	The only problem was that Tom didn't want to be here.
2662630	eng	That's one problem I might be able to help you solve.
2662631	eng	That would be how I would solve this kind of problem.
2662632	eng	My biggest problem is deciding what I should do next.
2662633	eng	Maybe your problem is that you don't know what to do.
2662634	eng	It sounds like there's a problem with exhaust system.
2662635	eng	I think this has something to do with Tom's problems.
2662636	eng	You need to understand the magnitude of the problem.
2662637	eng	You know where to reach me if you have any problems.
2662638	eng	What was the problem you wanted to talk to me about?
2662639	eng	Tom told me that he'd never had that problem before.
2662640	eng	There are various ways we could handle this problem.
2662641	eng	The problem is we don't have enough information yet.
2662642	eng	The problem is that Tom doesn't get along with Mary.
2662643	eng	The only problem was Tom didn't get along with Mary.
2662644	eng	It's no problem for me to help you tomorrow morning.
2662645	eng	It won't be a problem to reschedule the appointment.
2662646	eng	It took Tom only three minutes to solve the problem.
2662647	eng	If you don't mind telling me, what was your problem?
2662648	eng	If Tom had money problems, I think he'd let us know.
2662649	eng	If they were Canadians, this problem wouldn't exist.
2662650	eng	If there was a problem, Tom would've said something.
2662651	eng	I'm sorry to disturb you, but we have a big problem.
2662652	eng	I need to warn Tom that there may be a few problems.
2662653	eng	I get depressed whenever I think about that problem.
2662654	eng	I don't think this is going to be a problem anymore.
2662655	eng	Did you have any problem getting all your work done?
2662656	eng	Tom, if there's a problem, I want to hear about it.
2662657	eng	Tom probably ran into these kinds of problems, too.
2662658	eng	Tom is the one who needs to deal with this problem.
2662659	eng	There are various ways to take care of the problem.
2662660	eng	My problem is that my wife doesn't love me anymore.
2662661	eng	My problem is I love Mary, but she doesn't love me.
2662662	eng	Let's hope we can avoid this problem in the future.
2662663	eng	Let's check with Tom and see what his problems are.
2662664	eng	In time, all these minor problems will be resolved.
2662665	eng	I've always had a problem with the way Tom behaves.
2662666	eng	I understand you have a problem and want some help.
2662667	eng	I think it's going to be a little bit of a problem.
2662668	eng	I think I can solve this problem without your help.
2662669	eng	I came here to discuss a personal problem with you.
2662670	eng	Why would Tom have a problem with Mary helping us?
2662671	eng	What's the quickest way to deal with this problem?
2662672	eng	We won't be able to solve this problem on our own.
2662673	eng	Tom says he doesn't know how to solve the problem.
2662674	eng	There's another problem you don't even know about.
2662675	eng	The problem's a little more complicated than that.
2662676	eng	The problem was I didn't know Tom was dating Mary.
2662677	eng	The problem is that Tom is just as scared as I am.
2662678	eng	One of Tom's problems is his short attention span.
2662679	eng	My biggest problem is deciding what I should wear.
2662680	eng	Let's approach the problem from a different angle.
2662681	eng	It'll be no problem to reschedule the appointment.
2662682	eng	If you have a problem with that, talk to the boss.
2662683	eng	I'm too tired to deal with this problem right now.
2662684	eng	I don't think you'll have the same problems I had.
2662685	eng	I don't think Tom's going to be a problem anymore.
2662686	eng	Has Tom been having problems with anyone recently?
2662687	eng	At first, I thought it might be a serious problem.
2662688	eng	Were you aware Tom was having financial problems?
2662689	eng	We must deal with this problem as soon as we can.
2662690	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what the problem was.
2662691	eng	There's another problem we haven't discussed yet.
2662692	eng	The problem was we couldn't find a place to park.
2662693	eng	The problem is what Tom does when we aren't here.
2662694	eng	The problem is we're not sure Tom can do the job.
2662695	eng	The problem is we don't know anything about that.
2662696	eng	The problem is I don't know where my umbrella is.
2662697	eng	The only problem is we don't know where to start.
2662698	eng	Solving your problem should be first on the list.
2662699	eng	Our office helps students with personal problems.
2662700	eng	It sounded like you had a problem here yesterday.
2662701	eng	If there were a problem, Tom would say something.
2662702	eng	If there had been a problem, Tom would've called.
2662703	eng	If anyone has any problems, tell them to call me.
2662704	eng	I think they've encountered some kind of problem.
2662705	eng	I have more problems than I can handle right now.
2662706	eng	I had a problem similar to that not too long ago.
2662707	eng	I don't think you want to hear about my problems.
2662708	eng	Don't you think Tom might be part of the problem?
2662709	eng	Could you help us find a solution to the problem?
2662710	eng	Are you expecting to have the problem fixed soon?
2662711	eng	Your problem is you think all dogs are friendly.
2662712	eng	Your problem is you don't listen very carefully.
2662713	eng	Your problem is you believe everything Tom says.
2662714	eng	Tom said you were having problems with your car.
2662715	eng	Tom might be able to help you with your problem.
2662716	eng	There's a problem with the plane's landing gear.
2662717	eng	The problem was I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
2662718	eng	The only one who has a problem with this is you.
2662719	eng	That's a problem you have to handle by yourself.
2662720	eng	Shyness doesn't seem to be one of your problems.
2662721	eng	Rescheduling the appointment won't be a problem.
2662722	eng	Maybe you can help me with a problem I'm having.
2662723	eng	Let me help you with your other problem instead.
2662724	eng	It's no secret Tom and Mary are having problems.
2662725	eng	It looks like your problems are worse than mine.
2662726	eng	It could just be a problem with the spark plugs.
2662727	eng	If Tom has a problem with me, he should tell me.
2662728	eng	I'm terribly sorry if that causes you a problem.
2662729	eng	I wonder if you could help me solve the problem.
2662730	eng	I had a little problem replacing the oil filter.
2662731	eng	I don't want to discuss Tom's problems with you.
2662732	eng	I don't usually have any problem falling asleep.
2662733	eng	I don't think that's what's causing the problem.
2662734	eng	Eventually, the problem may take care of itself.
2662735	eng	Did you think that might be part of the problem?
2662736	eng	Are there any problems we need to deal with now?
2662737	eng	Apparently, all Tom's other problems are solved.
2662738	eng	You need to understand how big this problem is.
2662739	eng	Will this really make all our problems go away?
2662740	eng	Tom will be able to solve the problem, I think.
2662741	eng	Tom has a history of alcohol and drug problems.
2662742	eng	There's no one here to help us fix the problem.
2662743	eng	There's just one problem with this arrangement.
2662744	eng	The problem is these shoes don't fit very well.
2662745	eng	The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
2662746	eng	The problem is that Tom doesn't have any money.
2662747	eng	The only problem is Tom didn't finish his exam.
2662748	eng	That's the least of our problems at the moment.
2662749	eng	Possibly you share some blame for this problem.
2662750	eng	Our problem now is how to persuade Tom to quit.
2662751	eng	My biggest problem is deciding what to do next.
2662752	eng	It's no problem for me to do it this afternoon.
2662753	eng	It sounds like you two had a problem yesterday.
2662754	eng	It sounds like you two had a problem in Boston.
2662755	eng	If you ask me, Tom is the one with the problem.
2662756	eng	If Tom does that, then we won't have a problem.
2662757	eng	I've never had any problem with Tom personally.
2662758	eng	I think you can solve this problem on your own.
2662759	eng	I had a similar problem when I lived in Boston.
2662760	eng	Do you think that might be part of the problem?
2662761	eng	Admitting you have a problem is the first step.
2662762	eng	Your problem is you don't get enough exercise.
2662763	eng	Would you mind telling me what the problem is?
2662764	eng	Why would Tom have any problem making friends?
2662765	eng	What seems to be the problem with the machine?
2662766	eng	We still have to solve the underlying problem.
2662767	eng	We haven't been able to solve the problem yet.
2662768	eng	We could have a problem if Tom shows up early.
2662769	eng	Tom knows all about Mary's financial problems.
2662770	eng	Tom deals with that kind of problem every day.
2662771	eng	This may end up being somebody else's problem.
2662772	eng	This has been your problem from the beginning.
2662773	eng	There's a problem with my internet connection.
2662774	eng	There's a problem I have to talk to you about.
2662775	eng	The problem is that we don't have enough time.
2662776	eng	The only problem is where do we start looking?
2662777	eng	My job is to help people solve their problems.
2662778	eng	If anyone has a problem, tell them to call me.
2662779	eng	I've never had these kinds of problems before.
2662780	eng	I'm pretty sure it's just a temporary problem.
2662781	eng	I'm having a problem deleting one of my files.
2662782	eng	I think you're going to have problems with Tom.
2662783	eng	I think I'm beginning to see the problem here.
2662784	eng	I think I can solve this problem without help.
2662785	eng	I don't have a problem with anything you said.
2662786	eng	Have you run into this kind of problem before?
2662787	eng	Have you been having problems with your email?
2662788	eng	Do you think Tom might be part of the problem?
2662789	eng	Do you have a problem with what was suggested?
2662790	eng	Did Tom tell you he was having money problems?
2662791	eng	As anticipated, there have been some problems.
2662792	eng	We need someone to take care of this problem.
2662793	eng	Tom tried to solve the problem, but couldn't.
2662794	eng	Tom knows all about Mary's personal problems.
2662795	eng	Tom is rich, so money isn't really a problem.
2662796	eng	Tom had no difficulty in solving the problem.
2662797	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be aware of the problems.
2662798	eng	Tom came up with the solution to the problem.
2662799	eng	That could be the answer to all our problems.
2662800	eng	Problems don't usually go away by themselves.
2662801	eng	My family problems aren't all that important.
2662802	eng	Just be thankful you don't have our problems.
2662803	eng	If Tom were here, we wouldn't have a problem.
2662804	eng	I'm not going to ask Tom what his problem is.
2662805	eng	I think Tom is having serious money problems.
2662806	eng	I had a problem starting my car this morning.
2662807	eng	I don't know why that would be a problem now.
2662808	eng	I didn't come here to talk about my problems.
2662809	eng	Have your knees been giving you any problems?
2662810	eng	Whatever the problem is, we can work it out.
2662811	eng	We need to find out what caused the problem.
2662812	eng	We need to deal with this problem right now.
2662813	eng	Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
2662814	eng	Tom is having some problems with his grades.
2662815	eng	Tom has a good understanding of the problem.
2662816	eng	Tom didn't realize that there was a problem.
2662817	eng	This probably won't end all of our problems.
2662818	eng	This is the problem we should work on first.
2662819	eng	This is the problem I was telling you about.
2662820	eng	There don't seem to be any serious problems.
2662821	eng	The problem is worse than we thought it was.
2662822	eng	That's the least of your problems right now.
2662823	eng	Our problems are nothing compared to theirs.
2662824	eng	One of Tom's problems is that he can't read.
2662825	eng	Obviously, there was a problem of some sort.
2662826	eng	Not every problem has an immediate solution.
2662827	eng	Let's only talk about one problem at a time.
2662828	eng	It's obviously not exactly the same problem.
2662829	eng	Is this how you handle all of your problems?
2662830	eng	I'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.
2662831	eng	I hope the problem will take care of itself.
2662832	eng	I don't really know what the problem is yet.
2662833	eng	Have you ever had a problem similar to this?
2662834	eng	Be careful not to underestimate the problem.
2662835	eng	At least I'll never have that problem again.
2662836	eng	Are there any problems we should know about?
2662837	eng	Your problem is you eat too much junk food.
2662838	eng	You're lucky you don't have Tom's problems.
2662839	eng	Whatever the problem is, Tom can handle it.
2662840	eng	What seems to be the problem with your car?
2662841	eng	We need to do something about this problem.
2662842	eng	Tom knows all about Mary's health problems.
2662843	eng	Tom didn't want to talk about his problems.
2662844	eng	Tom didn't want to discuss Mary's problems.
2662845	eng	They say that every problem has a solution.
2662846	eng	There's a problem with the air conditioner.
2662847	eng	Then I'm afraid we have a bit of a problem.
2662848	eng	The problem was we didn't have enough time.
2662849	eng	The problem seems to have corrected itself.
2662850	eng	The broken leg isn't Tom's biggest problem.
2662851	eng	That was the only way to solve the problem.
2662852	eng	Thank you for helping us solve the problem.
2662853	eng	Soon, this will be somebody else's problem.
2662854	eng	Our problems are nothing compared to Tom's.
2662855	eng	My boss would have a big problem with that.
2662856	eng	Most people don't have a problem with that.
2662857	eng	Let's not deal with that problem right now.
2662858	eng	It's not a problem to postpone the meeting.
2662859	eng	It's going to be a little bit of a problem.
2662860	eng	Is that going to be a problem for you, too?
2662861	eng	If you have any more problems, let me know.
2662862	eng	I've no idea what's causing these problems.
2662863	eng	I've never had this kind a problem at work.
2662864	eng	I was unaware that Tom was having problems.
2662865	eng	I think you're oversimplifying the problem.
2662866	eng	I think I can solve this problem by myself.
2662867	eng	I heard you were having problems at school.
2662868	eng	I don't think there should be any problems.
2662869	eng	I don't have a problem with Tom doing that.
2662870	eng	I didn't think Tom would have any problems.
2662871	eng	Has Tom ever had any other health problems?
2662872	eng	Fortunately, Tom knows what the problem is.
2662873	eng	Did Tom know about Mary's drinking problem?
2662874	eng	Did Tom have any problems that you know of?
2662875	eng	Your problem is you're not patient enough.
2662876	eng	You're not the only one with this problem.
2662877	eng	We've never had a problem with Tom before.
2662878	eng	We were having a few problems a while ago.
2662879	eng	We must deal with this problem right away.
2662880	eng	Tom is the one who always causes problems.
2662881	eng	Tom had some problems he had to deal with.
2662882	eng	Tom didn't want to hear about my problems.
2662883	eng	This problem must be dealt with carefully.
2662884	eng	This doesn't seem to be a serious problem.
2662885	eng	There's a simple solution to this problem.
2662886	eng	The problem was I didn't know who Tom was.
2662887	eng	The problem is we don't know where Tom is.
2662888	eng	That's never been a problem for us before.
2662889	eng	That would solve the problem, wouldn't it?
2662890	eng	Perhaps we could discuss your problem now.
2662891	eng	Most people can do this without a problem.
2662892	eng	Maybe you can help us isolate the problem.
2662893	eng	It's no secret Tom and Mary have problems.
2662894	eng	It's a much larger problem than you think.
2662895	eng	It took us days to track down the problem.
2662896	eng	I've never had this kind a problem before.
2662897	eng	I've never had a problem with my computer.
2662898	eng	I'm afraid we've got quite a problem here.
2662899	eng	I hope I'll never have that problem again.
2662900	eng	I heard Tom was having problems at school.
2662901	eng	I have no idea how to handle this problem.
2662902	eng	I don't know anything about Tom's problem.
2662903	eng	I don't have a problem with what Tom said.
2662904	eng	Does anyone else have a problem with that?
2662905	eng	Do you know what the problem with this is?
2662906	eng	Do you know what the problem with that is?
2662907	eng	Could you see if the problem still exists?
2662908	eng	By tomorrow, there'll be no more problems.
2662909	eng	As anticipated, we have had some problems.
2662910	eng	Your problem is you're easily distracted.
2662911	eng	We've got a little bit of a problem here.
2662912	eng	We need to work together on this problem.
2662913	eng	Tom shouldn't have any problem with that.
2662914	eng	Tom is having some problems with his car.
2662915	eng	Tom hoped the problem would solve itself.
2662916	eng	Tom has no idea what Mary's problems are.
2662917	eng	Tom has never had a problem with his car.
2662918	eng	Tom had a problem opening the front door.
2662919	eng	Tom and Mary both have drinking problems.
2662920	eng	This isn't the only problem that we face.
2662921	eng	This is my problem and I'll deal with it.
2662922	eng	They're going to have a problem, I think.
2662923	eng	There must be a solution to this problem.
2662924	eng	The problem was I couldn't sing or dance.
2662925	eng	The problem is you're not patient enough.
2662926	eng	The bleeding isn't Tom's biggest problem.
2662927	eng	That's the problem with buying wholesale.
2662928	eng	That's the next problem we need to solve.
2662929	eng	That wouldn't really be a problem for me.
2662930	eng	That shouldn't be a problem in this case.
2662931	eng	Maybe you're oversimplifying the problem.
2662932	eng	Maybe it's a problem with the carburetor.
2662933	eng	Let's sit down and work this problem out.
2662934	eng	It looks like you've got another problem.
2662935	eng	If Tom has a problem, you could help him.
2662936	eng	I'm hoping it's only a temporary problem.
2662937	eng	I was talking about the problem with Tom.
2662938	eng	I think Tom has serious problems at home.
2662939	eng	I don't think there will be any problems.
2662940	eng	I don't think it's Tom who's the problem.
2662941	eng	I don't know exactly what the problem is.
2662942	eng	Have you had problems with anyone lately?
2662943	eng	Have either of you run into any problems?
2662944	eng	Has Tom ever caused problems for anybody?
2662945	eng	Getting there on time won't be a problem.
2662946	eng	Can we get back to discussing my problem?
2662947	eng	Are you having problems with anyone here?
2662948	eng	Are we going to have a problem with that?
2662949	eng	All Tom's problems have just been solved.
2662950	eng	All the problems haven't been solved yet.
2662951	eng	You don't seem to be having any problem.
2662952	eng	Why is Tom always having money problems?
2662953	eng	Why does Tom always have money problems?
2662954	eng	Who's having a problem here, you or Tom?
2662955	eng	We've been trying to avoid that problem.
2662956	eng	We're currently working on that problem.
2662957	eng	We now have a whole new set of problems.
2662958	eng	We need to start working on the problem.
2662959	eng	We haven't encountered any new problems.
2662960	eng	We have some legal problems to work out.
2662961	eng	Tom might have a real problem with that.
2662962	eng	Tom has a very serious drinking problem.
2662963	eng	Tom doesn't have any problems at school.
2662964	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary's problem was.
2662965	eng	Those are about to become your problems.
2662966	eng	They have no idea what our problems are.
2662967	eng	There was a problem with the thermostat.
2662968	eng	The problem was I couldn't speak French.
2662969	eng	The problem is we don't know who Tom is.
2662970	eng	That shouldn't be too much of a problem.
2662971	eng	That obviously wasn't a problem for Tom.
2662972	eng	Now there's a whole new set of problems.
2662973	eng	Maybe I can help you solve that problem.
2662974	eng	Let's handle this one problem at a time.
2662975	eng	It looks like you've got other problems.
2662976	eng	If you have a problem, ask Tom for help.
2662977	eng	I've had some problems dealing with Tom.
2662978	eng	I wish you didn't have so many problems.
2662979	eng	I thought I had that problem worked out.
2662980	eng	I think Tom can help me with my problem.
2662981	eng	I think I might have a drinking problem.
2662982	eng	I think I know what the problem is here.
2662983	eng	I heard you're having problems with Tom.
2662984	eng	I have a problem and I need your advice.
2662985	eng	How would you take care of this problem?
2662986	eng	Do you understand why this is a problem?
2662987	eng	Call me if you have any problems at all.
2662988	eng	Your problem is you don't study enough.
2662989	eng	What to do about it is still a problem.
2662990	eng	What exactly was your problem with Tom?
2662991	eng	We've got bigger problems to deal with.
2662992	eng	We've got a major problem on our hands.
2662993	eng	We're still having those same problems.
2662994	eng	We have bigger problems to worry about.
2662995	eng	We have a serious problem on our hands.
2662996	eng	We don't know if it's a problem or not.
2662997	eng	We discussed the problem all afternoon.
2662998	eng	Tom would have a big problem with that.
2662999	eng	Tom is still dealing with that problem.
2663000	eng	Tom has a lot of problems to deal with.
2663001	eng	This may have been part of the problem.
2663002	eng	There's only one problem with our plan.
2663003	eng	There haven't been any problems so far.
2663004	eng	That's always been our biggest problem.
2663005	eng	Let's get Tom to look into the problem.
2663006	eng	It seems we have more than one problem.
2663007	eng	It looks like you have bigger problems.
2663008	eng	Is this going to cause us any problems?
2663009	eng	Is there a problem I should know about?
2663010	eng	I've never had a problem with this car.
2663011	eng	I wish we didn't have so many problems.
2663012	eng	I was discussing that problem with Tom.
2663013	eng	I heard you had some problems with Tom.
2663014	eng	I have no problem delegating authority.
2663015	eng	I don't want to discuss Tom's problems.
2663016	eng	I don't think you'll have that problem.
2663017	eng	Have you been having problems with Tom?
2663018	eng	Hasn't this been the problem all along?
2663019	eng	Do you have a problem with any of this?
2663020	eng	Air pollution is a problem around here.
2663021	eng	After tonight, that won't be a problem.
2663022	eng	What's the problem with your computer?
2663023	eng	What problem did you tell Tom you had?
2663024	eng	What do you think about Tom's problem?
2663025	eng	We seem to have a little problem here.
2663026	eng	Tom should have no problem doing that.
2663027	eng	Tom said that the problem was serious.
2663028	eng	Tom is the one who caused the problem.
2663029	eng	Tom has been looking into the problem.
2663030	eng	This may be a solution to the problem.
2663031	eng	This is no longer an isolated problem.
2663032	eng	There's a little problem with the car.
2663033	eng	The problem is we don't know anything.
2663034	eng	The problem is I don't have much time.
2663035	eng	The only one who has a problem is you.
2663036	eng	That would be Tom's problem, not ours.
2663037	eng	It's not going to be a problem, is it?
2663038	eng	It's not a big a problem as you think.
2663039	eng	It sounds like you're having problems.
2663040	eng	It seems we have quite a few problems.
2663041	eng	Is that going to be a problem for you?
2663042	eng	I'm having a problem with my computer.
2663043	eng	I have no problem letting others help.
2663044	eng	I guess you've got yourself a problem.
2663045	eng	I don't think I really have a problem.
2663046	eng	Fortunately, I've solved your problem.
2663047	eng	Does anybody have a problem with this?
2663048	eng	Does anybody have a problem with that?
2663049	eng	Do you understand what the problem is?
2663050	eng	Are you having problems with your car?
2663051	eng	Your problem is you're not motivated.
2663052	eng	You said that the problem isn't ours.
2663053	eng	Why would Tom be having problems?
2663054	eng	What kind of problems are you having?
2663055	eng	We're having some equipment problems.
2663056	eng	Was Tom having a problem with anyone?
2663057	eng	Tom wondered what Mary's problem was.
2663058	eng	Tom said there's problem with the TV.
2663059	eng	Tom lived there without any problems.
2663060	eng	Tom has no idea what my problems are.
2663061	eng	Tom doesn't have a problem with that.
2663062	eng	Tom discussed that problem with Mary.
2663063	eng	Tom blamed Mary for all his problems.
2663064	eng	There shouldn't be any more problems.
2663065	eng	The only problem was Tom didn't care.
2663066	eng	The only problem is Tom didn't leave.
2663067	eng	That's the answer to all my problems.
2663068	eng	That still doesn't solve the problem.
2663069	eng	Right now, we've got bigger problems.
2663070	eng	Right now, we've got another problem.
2663071	eng	Now, let's discuss our other problem.
2663072	eng	My problem is that I'm always hungry.
2663073	eng	Let's help them solve their problems.
2663074	eng	It's not going to be a problem at all.
2663075	eng	It's going to be a problem, isn't it?
2663076	eng	It's actually not that big a problem.
2663077	eng	It sounds like you two had a problem.
2663078	eng	Is Tom still having trouble sleeping?
2663079	eng	I want to tell you about my problems.
2663080	eng	I think that's a part of the problem.
2663081	eng	I hope this solves all your problems.
2663082	eng	I have some problems to take care of.
2663083	eng	I have a little problem here at work.
2663084	eng	I don't think it's a problem anymore.
2663085	eng	I can't solve this problem on my own.
2663086	eng	Do you have a problem with this, too?
2663087	eng	Do you have a problem with this plan?
2663088	eng	Do you have a problem with that, Tom?
2663089	eng	You've always had problems with Tom.
2663090	eng	We're having a problem with pigeons.
2663091	eng	We won't have any problems, will we?
2663092	eng	We have a very serious problem here.
2663093	eng	We have a bit of a cash flow problem.
2663094	eng	Tom is very good at problem solving.
2663095	eng	Tom is dealing with the problem now.
2663096	eng	This should solve all your problems.
2663097	eng	This problem is both yours and ours.
2663098	eng	This could become a serious problem.
2663099	eng	There's never been a problem before.
2663100	eng	There don't seem to be any problems.
2663101	eng	Then we shouldn't have any problems.
2663102	eng	Then there shouldn't be any problem.
2663103	eng	The problem should be solved by now.
2663104	eng	The problem is worse than I thought.
2663105	eng	The problem has to be taken care of.
2663106	eng	That's going to cause some problems.
2663107	eng	That'll be my next problem to solve.
2663108	eng	That shouldn't be much of a problem.
2663109	eng	That isn't likely to be the problem.
2663110	eng	Let's discuss that problem tomorrow.
2663111	eng	It sounded like there was a problem.
2663112	eng	If you have any problems, I'll help.
2663113	eng	I'm sure there won't be any problem.
2663114	eng	I thought I was part of the problem.
2663115	eng	I haven't had too many problems yet.
2663116	eng	I have to solve this problem myself.
2663117	eng	How should we deal with the problem?
2663118	eng	How do we make this problem go away?
2663119	eng	Every problem has a solution, right?
2663120	eng	Do you think Tom has a drug problem?
2663121	eng	Actually, we have sort of a problem.
2663122	eng	Who's responsible for this problem?
2663123	eng	What was the problem with your car?
2663124	eng	What seems to be the problem today?
2663125	eng	Well then, we still have a problem.
2663126	eng	Tom tackled the problem right away.
2663127	eng	Tom might help us with our problem.
2663128	eng	Tom has problems dealing with Mary.
2663129	eng	Tom had some problems to deal with.
2663130	eng	Tom had problems dealing with Mary.
2663131	eng	This is someone else's problem now.
2663132	eng	They really have got a problem now.
2663133	eng	There must be some kind of problem.
2663134	eng	The spark plugs aren't the problem.
2663135	eng	The problem was difficult to solve.
2663136	eng	The problem is you're not Canadian.
2663137	eng	That's exactly what the problem is.
2663138	eng	That has no bearing on the problem.
2663139	eng	That could solve a lot of problems.
2663140	eng	Right now, you have other problems.
2663141	eng	Please tell me about your problems.
2663142	eng	It isn't me Tom has a problem with.
2663143	eng	It does cause a problem, doesn't it?
2663144	eng	Is there some kind of problem here?
2663145	eng	Is there a problem between you two?
2663146	eng	If you have any problem, just call.
2663147	eng	If you have a problem, talk to Tom.
2663148	eng	I'm glad I don't have that problem.
2663149	eng	I wasn't able to solve the problem.
2663150	eng	I have a problem to deal with here.
2663151	eng	I have a much more serious problem.
2663152	eng	Does Tom have any medical problems?
2663153	eng	Can you explain your problem to us?
2663154	eng	Are you saying there were problems?
2663155	eng	Are you ready for the next problem?
2663156	eng	All your problems have been solved.
2663157	eng	Your problems are similar to mine.
2663158	eng	What seems to be the problem, Tom?
2663159	eng	What seems to be the problem here?
2663160	eng	We never had any problems with it.
2663161	eng	We can't just ignore this problem.
2663162	eng	Tom was able to solve the problem.
2663163	eng	Tom solved the problem by himself.
2663164	eng	Tom said he agrees it's a problem.
2663165	eng	Tom kept silent about the problem.
2663166	eng	Tom is thinking about the problem.
2663167	eng	Tom is someone else's problem now.
2663168	eng	Tom has trouble remembering names.
2663169	eng	Tom decided to ignore the problem.
2663170	eng	This solves a lot of our problems.
2663171	eng	There's only one problem, I think.
2663172	eng	There's a problem with the engine.
2663173	eng	There was a problem at the office.
2663174	eng	There might be a problem with Tom.
2663175	eng	That's the least of your problems.
2663176	eng	That's one of my biggest problems.
2663177	eng	That's a very complicated problem.
2663178	eng	That only makes the problem worse.
2663179	eng	That doesn't seem to be a problem.
2663180	eng	Our main problem remains unsolved.
2663181	eng	No mechanical problems were found.
2663182	eng	Let's get to work on that problem.
2663183	eng	Let them solve their own problems.
2663184	eng	It's not Tom's problem. It's mine.
2663185	eng	It's not really much of a problem.
2663186	eng	It's a fairly complicated problem.
2663187	eng	It sounds like Tom is the problem.
2663188	eng	Is there a problem with the motor?
2663189	eng	Is that still giving you problems?
2663190	eng	If you ask me, Tom is the problem.
2663191	eng	If Tom is here, we have a problem.
2663192	eng	I've never had a problem with Tom.
2663193	eng	I'll deal with this problem later.
2663194	eng	I never had that problem with Tom.
2663195	eng	I figured out what the problem is.
2663196	eng	How would you handle this problem?
2663197	eng	Everybody tells me their problems.
2663198	eng	Does Tom know what the problem is?
2663199	eng	Does Tom have a problem with that?
2663200	eng	Do you have any problem with that?
2663201	eng	Are you having financial problems?
2663202	eng	You've got some serious problems.
2663203	eng	You'll have no problem with this.
2663204	eng	You won't have any more problems.
2663205	eng	What was Tom's problem with that?
2663206	eng	What was Tom's problem with Mary?
2663207	eng	We've got a very serious problem.
2663208	eng	We're trying to fix this problem.
2663209	eng	We'll discuss this problem later.
2663210	eng	We were having problems with Tom.
2663211	eng	We solved that problem last week.
2663212	eng	Unfortunately, there's a problem.
2663213	eng	Tom said that wasn't his problem.
2663214	eng	Tom had a little problem earlier.
2663215	eng	This is potentially your problem.
2663216	eng	This has to be a fixable problem.
2663217	eng	There won't be any more problems.
2663218	eng	There were no problems to report.
2663219	eng	There may be a problem with that.
2663220	eng	That's the problem with this job.
2663221	eng	That's the only problem with Tom.
2663222	eng	That's the least of our problems.
2663223	eng	That's not going to be a problem.
2663224	eng	That won't be any problem at all.
2663225	eng	That should be no problem at all.
2663226	eng	That isn't going to be a problem.
2663227	eng	That could be a problem, I think.
2663228	eng	My job is to anticipate problems.
2663229	eng	Maybe Tom can solve this problem.
2663230	eng	Maybe that's part of the problem.
2663231	eng	Many problems resolve themselves.
2663232	eng	Let Tom know we've got a problem.
2663233	eng	It's never been a problem before.
2663234	eng	It won't be our problem, will it?
2663235	eng	It looks like you have a problem.
2663236	eng	It could cause too many problems.
2663237	eng	Is there a problem at the office?
2663238	eng	I've never had a problem with it.
2663239	eng	I'm trying to solve this problem.
2663240	eng	I'm trying to remedy the problem.
2663241	eng	I have trouble remembering names.
2663242	eng	I don't have a problem with that.
2663243	eng	Do you see why this is a problem?
2663244	eng	Do you have any medical problems?
2663245	eng	Did Tom have a problem with that?
2663246	eng	Call me if you have any problems.
2663247	eng	We have another problem as well.
2663248	eng	We had a little problem earlier.
2663249	eng	We had a few problems ourselves.
2663250	eng	Tom wasn't aware of the problem.
2663251	eng	Tom tried to ignore the problem.
2663252	eng	Tom is looking into the problem.
2663253	eng	Tom has some emotional problems.
2663254	eng	Tom has serious health problems.
2663255	eng	Tom has another problem as well.
2663256	eng	Tom has always had that problem.
2663257	eng	Tom didn't anticipate a problem.
2663258	eng	This is somebody else's problem.
2663259	eng	This is an entirely new problem.
2663260	eng	They're not the problem, we are.
2663261	eng	There may be a problem with Tom.
2663262	eng	There are no problems to report.
2663263	eng	That's the least of my problems.
2663264	eng	That's not your problem anymore.
2663265	eng	That may not solve your problem.
2663266	eng	That is potentially our problem.
2663267	eng	See if you can find the problem.
2663268	eng	Our house has a termite problem.
2663269	eng	No one sees a problem with this.
2663270	eng	My problem is I don't trust you.
2663271	eng	It's not my problem. It's yours.
2663272	eng	It's not my problem. It's Tom's.
2663273	eng	Is there a problem with my work?
2663274	eng	If it's Tom, we've got problems.
2663275	eng	I'm trying to solve the problem.
2663276	eng	I told Tom what the problem was.
2663277	eng	I think we've got a new problem.
2663278	eng	I think we've found the problem.
2663279	eng	I think I've solved the problem.
2663280	eng	I don't anticipate any problems.
2663281	eng	I do hope there isn't a problem.
2663282	eng	Do you know what the problem is?
2663283	eng	Do you have a problem with that?
2663284	eng	But that's not the real problem.
2663285	eng	Are you saying I have a problem?
2663286	eng	You've obviously got a problem.
2663287	eng	What's Tom's problem with Mary?
2663288	eng	We'll look into these problems.
2663289	eng	We'll have a problem, won't we?
2663290	eng	We still have the same problem.
2663291	eng	We have a serious problem here.
2663292	eng	Tom tried to solve the problem.
2663293	eng	Tom has psychological problems.
2663294	eng	This may not solve our problem.
2663295	eng	This has always been a problem.
2663296	eng	There's another slight problem.
2663297	eng	There will be no more problems.
2663298	eng	There shouldn't be any problem.
2663299	eng	The location isn't the problem.
2663300	eng	That doesn't solve the problem.
2663301	eng	Tell Tom the problem is solved.
2663302	eng	Stop looking for problems, Tom.
2663303	eng	No one has a problem with that.
2663304	eng	Like I said, we have a problem.
2663306	eng	It's Tom I have a problem with.
2663307	eng	It's not going to be a problem.
2663308	eng	It's me Tom has a problem with.
2663309	eng	It's just a mechanical problem.
2663310	eng	It won't be any problem at all.
2663311	eng	If you have any problems, call.
2663312	eng	If there are problems, call me.
2663313	eng	I've had problems with my boss.
2663314	eng	I'm not sure there's a problem.
2663315	eng	I think we have a problem here.

2663319	eng	Do you have a problem with Tom?
2663320	eng	Did you ever have that problem?
2663321	eng	Did you encounter any problems?
2663322	eng	Are we going to have a problem?
2663323	eng	Why should there be a problem?
2663324	eng	What if the problem isn't Tom?
2663325	eng	What exactly was your problem?
2663326	eng	We've got this problem licked.
2663327	eng	We've got problems of our own.

2663344	eng	That was the problem with Tom.
2663345	eng	That shouldn't be any problem.

2663348	eng	Our house has a mouse problem.
2663349	eng	Maybe the problem is you, Tom.
2663350	eng	Maybe that's the real problem.
2663351	eng	It's not your problem, anyway.
2663352	eng	It's not just a minor problem.
2663353	eng	It was never a problem before.
2663354	eng	Is this really such a problem?
2663355	eng	Is this going to be a problem?
2663356	eng	Is there some sort of problem?
2663357	eng	Is there some kind of problem?
