3722469	eng	It's admirable.
3722470	eng	Tom's loyalty is admirable.
3722471	eng	They say it's incurable.
3722472	eng	I don't need a table.
3722473	eng	Tom placed some cups of tea on the table.
3722474	eng	Tom is lying on the table.
3722475	eng	Tom left the book on the table.
3722476	eng	Tom examined the objects on the table.
3722477	eng	Tom is sitting at his usual table.
3722478	eng	I need your help clearing this table.
3722479	eng	Get that off my table.
3722480	eng	Tom tends to be unpredictable.
3722481	eng	It might be profitable.
3722483	eng	I was just being hospitable.
3722484	eng	That's very hospitable.
3722485	eng	If anything happens, I'm accountable.
3722486	eng	I can make them more comfortable.
3722487	eng	Tom tried to make himself comfortable.
3722488	eng	I only wanted to make you comfortable.
3722489	eng	It made me uncomfortable.
3722490	eng	It was rather uncomfortable.
3722491	eng	Tom is extremely unstable.
3722492	eng	This story you're telling is unbelievable.
3722493	eng	That meal was incredible.
3722494	eng	Tom's voice was hardly audible.
3722495	eng	You're not so horrible.
3722496	eng	The whiskey was horrible.
3722497	eng	I won't quit until we find out who's responsible.
3722498	eng	Tom was responsible.
3722499	eng	I wanted to find who was responsible.
3722500	eng	Tom knows there's only one course of action possible.
3722501	eng	Tell me how that's possible.
3722502	eng	I guess theoretically it's possible.
3722503	eng	I want to put all this behind me as soon as possible.
3722504	eng	I want to show it to Tom as soon as possible.
3722505	eng	I want a full evaluation as soon as possible.
3722506	eng	I'd like to get under way as soon as possible.
3722507	eng	A great deal more is possible.
3722508	eng	I've done everything humanly possible.
3722509	eng	It'd be impossible.
3722510	eng	That'd be impossible.
3722511	eng	Tom is always trying to do the impossible.
3722512	eng	Tom says we're not compatible.
3722513	eng	Tom drives some sort of little white convertible.
3722514	eng	Tom was irresistible.
3722515	eng	I'll make yours a double.
3722516	eng	I thought I'd save you the trouble.
3722517	eng	I'll save you the trouble.
3722518	eng	Tom isn't going to give us any more trouble.
3722519	eng	I'm in desperate trouble.
3722520	eng	Tom didn't give me an ounce of trouble.
3722521	eng	I can tell you've gone to a lot of trouble.
3722522	eng	You don't want to get in trouble.
3722523	eng	Tom, assure me there's going to be no trouble.
3722524	eng	Tom realized he was in deep trouble.
3722525	eng	You shouldn't go looking for trouble.
3722526	eng	Call if there's trouble.
3722527	eng	Don't go to all this trouble.
3722528	eng	I always expect trouble.
3722529	eng	In my profession, I always expect trouble.
3722530	eng	Tom knew this meant trouble.
3722531	eng	It's been nothing but trouble.
3722532	eng	I hope we don't run into any trouble.
3722533	eng	Call me if there's any trouble.
3722534	eng	I don't think Tom will give us any trouble.
3722535	eng	You and I both know you were the one who stole Tom's bicycle.
3722536	eng	Tom hopped on his motorcycle.
3722537	eng	I have to skedaddle.
3722538	eng	Tom turned the handle.
3722539	eng	It cost me a bundle.
3722540	eng	Tom tossed Mary a rifle.
3722541	eng	Tom made a grab for the rifle.
3722542	eng	There's no sign of a struggle.
3722543	eng	Tom's life has been a struggle.
3722544	eng	Tom disappeared into the jungle.
3722545	eng	Tom was an imbecile.
3722546	eng	Let me have the file.
3722547	eng	Tom went through the file.
3722548	eng	We like to keep a low profile.
3722549	eng	Tom waited a while.
3722550	eng	That could take a while.
3722551	eng	I know it's been a while.
3722552	eng	Give yourself a break once in a while.
3722553	eng	Tom continued after a while.
3722554	eng	Tom has obviously been dead for a while.
3722555	eng	I'm going to ask you to stay around for a while.
3722556	eng	Tom is going to crash here for a while.
3722557	eng	It was touch-and-go there for a while.
3722558	eng	Tom has obviously been listening for a while.
3722559	eng	Tom pondered the question for a while.
3722560	eng	I thought we could hang out in Boston for a while.
3722561	eng	I want you to get out of town for a while.
3722562	eng	Tom has been stalking Mary for a while.
3722563	eng	Tom has been at it a while.
3722564	eng	It just might take Tom a little while.
3722565	eng	I do remember you were in Boston for a short while.
3722566	eng	Tom didn't crack a smile.
3722567	eng	Tom tried to muster a smile.
3722568	eng	I make you smile.
3722569	eng	You need to shut your pie hole.
3722570	eng	Tom peeked out the peephole.
3722571	eng	I hope you like tuna noodle casserole.
3722572	eng	It was quite simple.
3722573	eng	The process is simple.
3722574	eng	Let's make this simple.
3722575	eng	It's never that simple.
3722576	eng	It's all very simple.
3722577	eng	Let's settle down, people.
3722578	eng	You have your orders, people.
3722579	eng	I know how to read people.
3722580	eng	Tom has murdered three people.
3722581	eng	We're reasonable people.
3722582	eng	You're frightening these people.
3722583	eng	I take care of people.
3722584	eng	I can't sing in front of people.
3722585	eng	What happened to Tom happens to a lot of people.
3722586	eng	I don't like upsetting people.
3722587	eng	I enjoy communicating with people.
3722588	eng	I became a lawyer to help people.
3722589	eng	Tom knows how to help people.
3722590	eng	You have more restraint than most people.
3722591	eng	I just never will understand you people.
3722592	eng	Tom is surrounded by people.
3722593	eng	These are my people.
3722594	eng	I didn't make you a cripple.
3722595	eng	We make quite a couple.
3722596	eng	You guys make such a cute couple.
3722597	eng	You guys are such a cute couple.
3722598	eng	You two make such an attractive couple.
3722599	eng	You guys make a very attractive couple.
3722600	eng	I don't need a whistle.
3722601	eng	I'm clean as a whistle.
3722602	eng	I won't blow the whistle.
3722603	eng	Tom turned off the boiling kettle.
3722604	eng	We have some things to settle.
3722605	eng	Tom stiffened a little.
3722606	eng	Tom stammered a little.
3722607	eng	It scares me a little.
3722608	eng	Tom drew back a little.
3722609	eng	I want you to pitch in a little.
3722610	eng	I thought we could catch up a little.
3722611	eng	We all need to lighten up a little.
3722612	eng	Tom quickly hid the bottle.
3722613	eng	I'll take the bottle.
3722614	eng	You almost had me.
3722615	eng	I've chosen you to succeed me.
3722616	eng	I have patients who need me.
3722617	eng	I'll be close by if you need me.
3722618	eng	I don't know why you can't admit that you need me.
3722619	eng	You knew that when you married me.
3722620	eng	You've already thanked me.
3722621	eng	You already thanked me.
3722622	eng	I still wouldn't know if Tom hadn't called me.
3722623	eng	You could've fooled me.
3722624	eng	It bothered me.
3722625	eng	I know why you've contacted me.
3722626	eng	I don't know how they spotted me.
3722627	eng	Tom immediately recognized me.
3722628	eng	We never had much in common, you and me.
3722629	eng	This isn't about you and me.
3722630	eng	Say you understand me.
3722631	eng	I'm more than willing to put it behind me.
3722632	eng	Don't say that name around me.
3722633	eng	You don't have to tiptoe around me.
3722634	eng	They must not have heard me.
3722635	eng	I don't know why it always has to be me.
3722636	eng	I'm really glad you can see me.
3722637	eng	I don't think Tom was particularly pleased to see me.
3722638	eng	You're the one that wanted to see me.
3722639	eng	I just want to make you as happy as you want to make me.
3722640	eng	You're just a thief like me.
3722641	eng	I already know that Tom doesn't like me.
3722642	eng	Tom is trying to provoke me.
3722643	eng	If I don't get to Boston for the convention, my boss will fire me.
3722644	eng	That's why you should hire me.
3722645	eng	Tom was the manager before me.
3722646	eng	You don't have to lecture me.
3722647	eng	You're attempting to confuse me.
3722648	eng	I used to dream about you coming to save me.
3722649	eng	I need someone to believe me.
3722650	eng	I need you to believe me.
3722651	eng	I can only hope that in time you'll forgive me.
3722652	eng	Don't tell me this doesn't involve me.
3722653	eng	I just want Tom to love me.
3722654	eng	That's why you love me.
3722655	eng	You can owe me.
3722656	eng	That's another one you owe me.
3722657	eng	You don't need to patronize me.
3722658	eng	You don't have to patronize me.
3722659	eng	I had my whole life ahead of me.
3722660	eng	Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
3722661	eng	I guess you've heard of me.
3722662	eng	You said you want to take care of me.
3722663	eng	It was selfish of me.
3722664	eng	I know what people think of me.
3722665	eng	Just stay in front of me.
3722666	eng	You haven't heard the last of me.
3722667	eng	They wormed it out of me.
3722668	eng	I want you to know I appreciate your recommending me.
3722669	eng	Thanks for asking me.
3722670	eng	That's what they have been telling me.
3722671	eng	Thanks for telling me.
3722672	eng	Thanks for not telling me.
3722673	eng	One thing's bothering me.
3722674	eng	Stop protecting me.
3722675	eng	Tom made a point of visiting me.
3722676	eng	Stop tormenting me.
3722677	eng	They can't touch me.
3722678	eng	Tom, don't play dumb with me.
3722679	eng	I know you must be frustrated with me.
3722680	eng	You don't have to pretend with me.
3722681	eng	Your secret will die with me.
3722682	eng	I can make any woman fall in love with me.
3722683	eng	Maybe something's wrong with me.
3722684	eng	That's totally cool with me.
3722685	eng	I don't know why you have a problem with me.
3722686	eng	You can be completely open with me.
3722687	eng	I brought my gun with me.
3722688	eng	Please bear with me.
3722689	eng	You have every reason to be upset with me.
3722690	eng	Don't toy with me.
3722691	eng	Don't try to sweet talk me.
3722692	eng	Tom is a fool, if you ask me.
3722693	eng	I really wish you'd call me.
3722694	eng	That's what people call me.
3722695	eng	I think you may as well tell me.
3722696	eng	That's what my doctors tell me.
3722697	eng	You're the expert, so you tell me.
3722698	eng	I want you to find what Tom took from me.
3722699	eng	Nothing can be hidden from me.
3722700	eng	Tom hid things from me.
3722701	eng	You didn't hear that from me.
3722702	eng	Move away from me.
3722703	eng	You can't take that away from me.
3722704	eng	Don't expect any mercy from me.
3722705	eng	I had a father who believed in me.
3722706	eng	No one believes in me.
3722707	eng	Tom has never laid a hand on me.
3722708	eng	It'll be on me.
3722709	eng	Tom took a chance on me.
3722710	eng	Don't you dare bail on me.
3722711	eng	Tom threatened to tell on me.
3722712	eng	Tom sometimes drops in on me.
3722713	eng	Don't you give up on me.
3722714	eng	The cab ride's on me.
3722715	eng	My mind must be playing tricks on me.
3722716	eng	Maybe my memories are playing tricks on me.
3722717	eng	I know you're holding out on me.
3722718	eng	You've been holding out on me.
3722719	eng	Don't you pass out on me.
3722720	eng	You should've come and talked to me.
3722721	eng	That's not how it looked to me.
3722722	eng	This isn't unlike what happened to me.
3722723	eng	Tom turned to me.
3722724	eng	You're so attracted to me.
3722725	eng	Tom has been a good friend to me.
3722726	eng	Tom was once a very good friend to me.
3722727	eng	It wouldn't kill you to be nice to me.
3722728	eng	One of them spoke to me.
3722729	eng	It's good that you came to me.
3722730	eng	You didn't have to come to me.
3722731	eng	Apologies mean nothing to me.
3722732	eng	That may mean nothing to you, but it means everything to me.
3722733	eng	Tom meant everything to me.
3722734	eng	I didn't like what Tom was doing to me.
3722735	eng	Please come back to me.
3722736	eng	It's all coming back to me.
3722737	eng	You'll talk to me.
3722738	eng	Stand up when you talk to me.
3722739	eng	It would mean a great deal to me.
3722740	eng	Now you listen to me.
3722741	eng	That's of no concern to me.
3722742	eng	Tom made himself known to me.
3722743	eng	You seem real familiar to me.
3722744	eng	Tom has been a good father to me.
3722745	eng	This isn't fair to me.
3722746	eng	They did things to me.
3722747	eng	I'm not sure you realize how important Tom is to me.
3722748	eng	I'm just glad it wasn't you who did this to me.
3722749	eng	You're precious to me.
3722750	eng	Hey, you can't say that to me.
3722751	eng	I'm not going to let Tom get to me.
3722752	eng	I'm not letting it get to me.
3722753	eng	You're a valuable asset to me.
3722754	eng	You still have to prove it to me.
3722755	eng	That used to mean a lot to me.
3722756	eng	Your being here means a lot to me.
3722757	eng	That may mean nothing to you, but it means a lot to me.
3722758	eng	That really meant a lot to me.
3722759	eng	Tom has been a great comfort to me.
3722760	eng	Tom made a polite bow to me.
3722761	eng	I was hoping you had something to say to me.
3722762	eng	I don't know what got into me.
3722763	eng	Tom is sure to try and stop me.
3722764	eng	You might just be able to stop me.
3722765	eng	I would hate to have a disease named after me.
3722766	eng	They named the library after me.
3722767	eng	Cut up my food for me.
3722768	eng	You know Mondays are hard for me.
3722769	eng	Tom knew it would be too hard for me.
3722770	eng	You might put in a word for me.
3722771	eng	That goes double for me.
3722772	eng	This isn't a good time for me.
3722773	eng	I wish Tom had more time for me.
3722774	eng	Tom was there for me.
3722775	eng	I need you to set up a meeting for me.
3722776	eng	I knew you'd come through for me.
3722777	eng	You're such a role model for me.
3722778	eng	See, that's going to be a problem for me.
3722779	eng	Tom has got it in for me.
3722780	eng	You asked me what you could do for me.
3722781	eng	Tom is covering up for me.
3722782	eng	I need you to open the door for me.
3722783	eng	I really can't thank you enough that you're doing this for me.
3722784	eng	I'm not telling you to do this for me.
3722785	eng	You always made my decisions for me.
3722786	eng	I can't believe you would do that for me.
3722787	eng	You have no respect for me.
3722788	eng	Don't ruin it for me.
3722789	eng	That's what worries me.
3722790	eng	I can't tell you how glad that makes me.
3722791	eng	I can't tell you how sad that makes me.
3722792	eng	I can't tell you how pleased that makes me.
3722793	eng	I can't tell you how happy that makes me.
3722794	eng	I can't tell you how unhappy that makes me.
3722795	eng	I can't tell you how angry that makes me.
3722796	eng	That's what troubles me.
3722797	eng	His name escapes me.
3722798	eng	Tom intrigues me.
3722799	eng	Tom is the only one who loves me.
3722800	eng	That's what concerns me.
3722801	eng	That's what bothers me.
3722802	eng	You don't have to impress me.
3722803	eng	I think Tom suspects me.
3722804	eng	I'll kill the first one who disobeys me.
3722805	eng	You have to look at me.
3722806	eng	Tom looked up at me.
3722807	eng	Everybody yells at me.
3722808	eng	Tom looked straight at me.
3722809	eng	Tom looked right at me.
3722810	eng	I know you have reason to doubt me.
3722811	eng	When Tom was alive, he could protect me.
3722812	eng	Tom is lying to protect me.
3722813	eng	Tom is out to get me.
3722814	eng	I guess you've caught me.
3722815	eng	You knew exactly where to hit me.
3722816	eng	You still manage to disappoint me.
3722817	eng	Tom was going to shoot me.
3722818	eng	I don't need you to support me.
3722819	eng	I knew you couldn't hurt me.
3722820	eng	I won't let you hurt me.
3722821	eng	You made it personal against me.
3722822	eng	You've lost me.
3722823	eng	I just need you to trust me.
3722824	eng	I had to make you trust me.
3722825	eng	You have the wrong idea about me.
3722826	eng	I didn't know that Tom talked about me.
3722827	eng	I never even knew you cared about me.
3722828	eng	I never knew you cared about me.
3722829	eng	You said some nice things about me.
3722830	eng	I know all of you have doubts about me.
3722831	eng	You couldn't live without me.
3722832	eng	Tom was going to betray me.
3722833	eng	You're foolish to think you can defy me.
3722834	eng	That's not why I came.
3722835	eng	I needed you and you came.
3722836	eng	Remember that this isn't a game.
3722837	eng	I'm here for the card game.
3722838	eng	You're intentionally throwing the game.
3722839	eng	You can't watch the game.
3722840	eng	Tom is sure that he'll win the game.
3722841	eng	We have ourselves a whole new ball game.
3722842	eng	I know chess isn't really your game.
3722843	eng	I know darts isn't really your game.
3722844	eng	Tom is definitely off his game.
3722845	eng	I'm really tired of this game.
3722846	eng	I think Tom would be a good name.
3722847	eng	I'd like to be able to tell people my real name.
3722848	eng	That's not my real name.
3722849	eng	I really like it when you say my name.
3722850	eng	You can't give yourself a nickname.
3722851	eng	Tom really needs a better nickname.
3722852	eng	We'll never be the same.
3722853	eng	In my place, Tom would've done the same.
3722854	eng	It doesn't look the same.
3722855	eng	It's just not the same.
3722856	eng	I know all about your little scheme.
3722857	eng	They're investigating a crime.
3722858	eng	I'm here to report a crime.
3722859	eng	Tom was never convicted of the crime.
3722860	eng	Tom must pay the price for his crime.
3722861	eng	I've been charged with a serious crime.
3722862	eng	Tom was happy for a time.
3722863	eng	Please let me answer one question at a time.
3722864	eng	At least somebody is having a good time.
3722865	eng	Tom seems to have had a very hard time.
3722866	eng	I guess I could've made the time.
3722867	eng	We'll make the time.
3722868	eng	Tom laughed all the time.
3722869	eng	Love happens in the workplace all the time.
3722870	eng	I have to watch them all the time.
3722871	eng	I can't be watching Tom all the time.
3722872	eng	You tell me that all the time.
3722873	eng	If anyone wants to surrender, now's the time.
3722874	eng	Now isn't the time.
3722875	eng	I wasn't aware of that at the time.
3722876	eng	You need to make time.
3722877	eng	Tom does this every single time.
3722878	eng	Tom has been way ahead of me the whole time.
3722879	eng	I've wanted to tell you this for some time.
3722880	eng	I can't afford to waste any more time.
3722881	eng	Tom wants us to move up our departure time.
3722882	eng	I'm afraid you've arrived in Boston at a most unfortunate time.
3722883	eng	I don't think I have that kind of time.
3722884	eng	I don't think we have that kind of time.
3722885	eng	Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
3722886	eng	I owe you big time.
3722887	eng	It's quitting time.
3722888	eng	You and I go back a long time.
3722889	eng	I haven't heard that particular saying in a long time.
3722890	eng	I've been after them for a long time.
3722891	eng	I won't be back this way for a long time.
3722892	eng	Tom has been in there an awfully long time.
3722893	eng	Tom has been around a very long time.
3722894	eng	Tom was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
3722895	eng	That still doesn't give us much time.
3722896	eng	We'll never get one here in time.
3722897	eng	I really did love Tom at one point in time.
3722898	eng	I'll see to it that we complete this project on time.
3722899	eng	We should be there in no time.
3722900	eng	I'll be checking your progress from time to time.
3722901	eng	I'm sorry, but we're rushed for time.
3722902	eng	Tom is still stalling for time.
3722903	eng	Tom was playing for time.
3722904	eng	I was just playing for time.
3722905	eng	I'm just advising you not to waste your time.
3722906	eng	I'll let you know when it's time.
3722907	eng	Tom has really outdone himself this time.
3722908	eng	We don't require assistance at this time.
3722909	eng	You're losing precious time.
3722910	eng	I couldn't talk on the phone at that time.
3722911	eng	Tom might have been sleeping at that time.
3722912	eng	I didn't know what it meant at that time.
3722913	eng	It's the right time.
3722914	eng	I've been lied to by Tom for the last time.
3722915	eng	There's always a first time.
3722916	eng	I don't think you heard me the first time.
3722917	eng	It's not my first time.
3722918	eng	There isn't going to be a next time.
3722919	eng	It was before my time.
3722920	eng	You're seriously wasting my time.
3722921	eng	I've given a speech or two in my time.
3722922	eng	I imagine that's what's going to happen every time.
3722923	eng	We should talk sometime.
3722924	eng	You need some downtime.
3722925	eng	There's more to come.
3722926	eng	You better come.
3722927	eng	Tom would be happy to know you've finally come.
3722928	eng	I came to give you a ride home.
3722929	eng	Welcome to our humble home.
3722930	eng	I need to come home.
3722931	eng	I just want to get everyone home.
3722932	eng	Find Tom and bring him home.
3722933	eng	I can at least take Tom home.
3722934	eng	I've got to get Tom home.
3722935	eng	Tom told the cop he had just gotten home.
3722936	eng	You're not even safe in your own home.
3722937	eng	Tom hinted very strongly that he wanted to go home.
3722938	eng	It's too close to home.
3722939	eng	I've got a child at home.
3722940	eng	Tom saw a light on in the house and figured someone was at home.
3722941	eng	You can finish it at home.
3722942	eng	Have a safe journey home.
3722943	eng	Tom is indeed quite handsome.
3722944	eng	There are some who would consider Tom handsome.
3722945	eng	You're looking extraordinarily handsome.
3722946	eng	You're getting very tiresome.
3722947	eng	That's going to look good on my resume.
3722948	eng	Tom was wearing a Superman costume.
3722949	eng	Somebody sabotaged this plane.
3722950	eng	I thought you were probably insane.
3722951	eng	Tom was sentenced to life in a prison for the criminally insane.
3722952	eng	Tom was pronounced dead on the scene.
3722953	eng	Tom uncorked the champagne.
3722954	eng	I don't know anything about cocaine.
3722955	eng	I paid a fine.
3722956	eng	That'd be fine.
3722957	eng	They're going to be fine.
3722958	eng	I think we're fine.
3722959	eng	Hang in there, Tom. You're doing fine.
3722960	eng	I'm sure it will all work out fine.
3722961	eng	That's hard to imagine.
3722962	eng	I know more than you could possibly imagine.
3722963	eng	Tom put the documents through the shredding machine.
3722964	eng	It's your reputation that's on the line.
3722965	eng	I'm sorry, I know I was out of line.
3722966	eng	That'll keep Tom in line.
3722967	eng	We're trying to see who can come up with the best pick up line.
3722968	eng	I'll never get used to skyrocketing prices for gasoline.
3722969	eng	It's going to be mine.
3722970	eng	That exact same thing happened to a good friend of mine.
3722971	eng	That very thing happened to a good friend of mine.
3722972	eng	Tom Jackson was a boyhood hero of mine.
3722973	eng	The pleasure's mine.
3722974	eng	I've got mine.
3722975	eng	Just so we're clear, that was Tom's idea, not mine.
3722976	eng	I'm under quarantine.
3722977	eng	I'm sure you already know the routine.
3722978	eng	Tom never varies his routine.
3722979	eng	Tom tasted the wine.
3722980	eng	Tom prefers red wine to white wine.
3722981	eng	I never really cared for white wine.
3722982	eng	Tom took a drink from a bottle of wine.
3722983	eng	Tom took another swig of wine.
3722984	eng	Tom was relaxing, drinking a glass of wine.
3722985	eng	Tom is sitting at the table, drinking wine.
3722986	eng	I didn't even know that you had one.
3722987	eng	You're an odd one.
3722988	eng	I know a good divorce lawyer if you need one.
3722989	eng	You're the married one.
3722990	eng	Have a good one.
3722991	eng	Tom thought Mary was the weird one.
3722992	eng	You're the strange one.
3722993	eng	I'm the insane one.
3722994	eng	We're going back to square one.
3722995	eng	It's back to square one.
3722996	eng	I could use one.
3722997	eng	It's a tough one.
3722998	eng	You're the cool one.
3722999	eng	Tom knew no one.
3723000	eng	The odds are two to one.
3723001	eng	You can't handle another one.
3723002	eng	Tom's a clever one.
3723003	eng	I need a new extension cord like this one.
3723004	eng	Every day won't all be like this one.
3723005	eng	I don't think there's any way out of this one.
3723006	eng	Let's try it with this one.
3723007	eng	Tom isn't budging on this one.
3723008	eng	You really lucked out on this one.
3723009	eng	Let me be your plus one.
3723010	eng	Tom's not quite sure of that one.
3723011	eng	We can't do anything with that one.
3723012	eng	Tom really came through on that one.
3723013	eng	You can sleep on that one.
3723014	eng	I was wrong about that one.
3723015	eng	Your path is a difficult one.
3723016	eng	Tom's path is a difficult one.
3723017	eng	I can only guess that you must want one.
3723018	eng	I totally owe you one.
3723019	eng	I'll run out and get you one.
3723020	eng	You told me I was the only one.
3723021	eng	I'm the crazy one.
3723022	eng	It's almost time for planting and there's a lot left to be done.
3723023	eng	I finally have the strength to do what must be done.
3723024	eng	Tom is asking if we're done.
3723025	eng	I don't think you realize what you've done.
3723026	eng	Tom, look what you've done.
3723027	eng	I could kill you for what you've done.
3723028	eng	It's the best thing Tom has ever done.
3723029	eng	The deal is done.
3723030	eng	Tom was there for me when I really needed someone.
3723031	eng	I think I just heard someone.
3723032	eng	I think Tom might be seeing someone.
3723033	eng	They were gone.
3723034	eng	Tom looks pretty far gone.
3723035	eng	I want to know who used to live here and where he's gone.
3723036	eng	The magic is gone.
3723037	eng	The truck is gone.
3723038	eng	I just can't believe Tom is gone.
3723039	eng	I need you gone.
3723040	eng	Tom groggily answered the phone.
3723041	eng	Tom is on the bed, talking on the phone.
3723042	eng	Tom is in his bedroom talking on the phone.
3723043	eng	Get me Tom on the phone.
3723044	eng	We can't get Tom on the phone.
3723045	eng	Tom left a detailed message on Mary's cell phone.
3723046	eng	Tom went over to the telephone.
3723047	eng	Tom was glad to be alone.
3723048	eng	It's better to be alone.
3723049	eng	Tom might arrive alone.
3723050	eng	I'm so alone.
3723051	eng	I don't think I care for your tone.
3723052	eng	I had a kidney stone.
3723053	eng	Tom never killed anyone.
3723054	eng	Tom would kill me if I told anyone.
3723055	eng	I've never been violent toward anyone.
3723056	eng	This will hardly convince anyone.
3723057	eng	I always thought I could work with anyone.
3723058	eng	Tom still hasn't made eye contact with anyone.
3723059	eng	I'm not trying to trick anyone.
3723060	eng	Tom didn't dare tell anyone.
3723061	eng	Tom never raised a hand to anyone.
3723062	eng	Tom isn't the sort to apologize to anyone.
3723063	eng	If you can talk to Tom, you can talk to anyone.
3723064	eng	Tom lives in seclusion and rarely sees anyone.
3723065	eng	We're not asking that you betray anyone.
3723066	eng	Just sit tight, everyone.
3723067	eng	These are just routine questions we ask everyone.
3723068	eng	I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone.
3723069	eng	I don't want to ruin the evening for everyone.
3723070	eng	Tom is well-liked by everyone.
3723071	eng	Tom was walking down the street, whistling a tune.
3723072	eng	Tom was smart enough to escape.
3723073	eng	I know Tom isn't in very good shape.
3723074	eng	Tom is wearing a stethoscope.
3723075	eng	You don't look like a dope.
3723076	eng	Someone told you I was coming, I hope.
3723077	eng	It's our one hope.
3723078	eng	I had one last hope.
3723079	eng	You were our last hope.
3723080	eng	You're our best hope.
3723081	eng	It might be our only hope.
3723082	eng	It may be your only hope.
3723083	eng	I'm your only hope.
3723084	eng	Tom cautiously opened the envelope.
3723085	eng	You must admit this would present quite a slippery slope.
3723086	eng	Tom is at the end of his rope.
3723087	eng	I know the type.
3723088	eng	We are what we are.
3723089	eng	Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
3723090	eng	You know what our instructions are.
3723091	eng	I can sense how worried you are.
3723092	eng	Tom isn't in the same place you are.
3723093	eng	I'm trying to figure it out just like you are.
3723094	eng	We're ready to go if you are.
3723095	eng	I'm ready to go if you are.
3723096	eng	I accept you for who you are.
3723097	eng	I can see how upset you are.
3723098	eng	I can sense how upset you are.
3723099	eng	You don't know how right you are.
3723100	eng	I can sense how angry you are.
3723101	eng	Tell us where they are.
3723102	eng	I wish I could tell you who they are.
3723103	eng	I don't think they're who they say they are.
3723104	eng	Tom's feet were bare.
3723105	eng	You can walk for all I care.
3723106	eng	You're going to require care.
3723107	eng	It's safe to say they don't much care.
3723108	eng	I believe you do care.
3723109	eng	Tom is under a doctor's care.
3723110	eng	Tell me why you care.
3723111	eng	There was a bomb scare.
3723112	eng	I'm not living on welfare.
3723113	eng	We all have secrets we'd prefer not to share.
3723114	eng	Tom gave Mary an icy glare.
3723115	eng	Living with you would be a nightmare.
3723116	eng	What happened to Tom was a nightmare.
3723117	eng	Tom gave Mary an icy stare.
3723118	eng	You won, fair and square.
3723119	eng	Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
3723120	eng	I'm sure Tom is quite sincere.
3723121	eng	I have nothing to add here.
3723122	eng	When I die, I want to be buried here.
3723123	eng	Hey, I'm practically naked here.
3723124	eng	Nothing like that ever happened here.
3723125	eng	Tell Tom everything that happened here.
3723126	eng	I want guards posted here.
3723127	eng	We've got one rule around here.
3723128	eng	I don't want Tom coming around here.
3723129	eng	People are trying to eat around here.
3723130	eng	I never thought I'd be here.
3723131	eng	It's not safe for me to be here.
3723132	eng	You don't want to do anything to remind them that you're not really old enough to be here.
3723133	eng	It's way too dangerous for us to be here.
3723134	eng	You're ruining what could be the most important night of my life here.
3723135	eng	I like the people here.
3723136	eng	You have many different kinds of people here.
3723137	eng	We're on a very tight schedule here.
3723138	eng	Tom was the reason why I came here.
3723139	eng	That's why we came here.
3723140	eng	I don't think we're welcome here.
3723141	eng	You're way out of line here.
3723142	eng	Listen, Tom can't know you're here.
3723143	eng	I like the friendly atmosphere here.
3723144	eng	You're playing with fire.
3723145	eng	It's important to look at the big picture here.
3723146	eng	You're no less a victim than anyone else here.
3723147	eng	I don't know how to behave here.
3723148	eng	I happen to live here.
3723149	eng	I'll let you off here.
3723151	eng	I'm busting out of here.
3723152	eng	Let's try and get Tom out of here.
3723153	eng	I want Tom out of here.
3723154	eng	I can get us out of here.
3723155	eng	I need your help to get out of here.
3723156	eng	I can get you out of here.
3723157	eng	I'm getting a bad feeling here.
3723158	eng	That's what I'm doing here.
3723159	eng	I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
3723160	eng	I'm perfectly comfortable waiting here.
3723161	eng	I'm waiting here.
3723162	eng	You're out of your depth here.
3723163	eng	You can't be back here.
3723164	eng	You go and get Tom and then come back here.
3723165	eng	I'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here.
3723166	eng	I can't hear myself think here.
3723167	eng	Tom said you could work here.
3723168	eng	You don't have to be crazy to work here.
3723169	eng	We're not in control here.
3723170	eng	I suspect you know why I'm here.
3723171	eng	I'm the victim here.
3723172	eng	You won't believe the view from here.
3723173	eng	People are trying to sleep in here.
3723174	eng	I hope there's plenty of air in here.
3723175	eng	I hope there's enough air in here.
3723176	eng	You two get in here.
3723177	eng	I'm very busy in here.
3723178	eng	I'm starting to get a picture of what's going on here.
3723179	eng	It's pretty clear what's going on here.
3723180	eng	Something very strange is going on here.
3723181	eng	I don't know what you think is going on here.
3723182	eng	You can't be down here.
3723183	eng	Maybe you should come down here.
3723184	eng	You don't have to sleep down here.
3723185	eng	There's nothing more Tom can do here.
3723186	eng	There must be somebody else up here.
3723187	eng	I'm burning up here.
3723188	eng	I'm up here.
3723189	eng	It's lovely up here.
3723190	eng	Tom is the floor manager here.
3723191	eng	You're not a prisoner here.
3723192	eng	The door's over here.
3723193	eng	Let's have another round of beers over here.
3723194	eng	Tom, look who's here.
3723195	eng	I didn't think you'd come while Tom was here.
3723196	eng	I'm not comfortable discussing this here.
3723197	eng	We're the victims here.
3723198	eng	I'm trying to get you to focus here.
3723199	eng	I came by last night, but you weren't here.
3723200	eng	I don't know what you're getting at here.
3723201	eng	It took you long enough to get here.
3723202	eng	I've got proof right here.
3723203	eng	I just happen to have a contract right here.
3723204	eng	I get the feeling something's not right here.
3723205	eng	You don't get to sit here.
3723206	eng	We're in the middle of an argument here.
3723207	eng	That's how I got here.
3723208	eng	If you're looking for Tom, he's not here.
3723209	eng	I'm in a bit of a tight spot here.
3723210	eng	I think Tom slept here.
3723211	eng	Let's be honest here.
3723212	eng	It's not just here.
3723213	eng	Thanks for letting us hang out here.
3723214	eng	We can work something out here.
3723215	eng	That's why I called you here.
3723216	eng	I'm of no use to you here.
3723217	eng	I think there's a place for you here.
3723218	eng	I've got something for you here.
3723219	eng	That's why I brought you here.
3723220	eng	I'm dead if I stay here.
3723221	eng	Your lives are in danger if you stay here.
3723222	eng	We're in uncharted territory here.
3723223	eng	I'm sensing a little hostility here.
3723224	eng	You're not a good enough pilot to be able to land there.
3723225	eng	Tom just stood there.
3723226	eng	Name the time and place, and I'll be there.
3723227	eng	Tom never bothered to tell Mary that he wasn't going to be there.
3723228	eng	I must be there.
3723229	eng	Tom just left me there.
3723230	eng	Evidence will show Tom was the only one there.
3723231	eng	Tell me you're there.
3723232	eng	You have to get out of there.
3723233	eng	Tom is anxious to get out of there.
3723234	eng	Sorry, I didn't see you standing there.
3723235	eng	There was something there.
3723236	eng	You really had me going there.
3723237	eng	It's just sitting there.
3723238	eng	I know you're back there.
3723239	eng	Tom won't even know I'm there.
3723240	eng	I can rent a boat from there.
3723241	eng	Thanks, Tom. I'll take it from there.
3723242	eng	Let's see what they have and we'll take it from there.
3723243	eng	I knew I had been there.
3723244	eng	I don't know what came over me in there.
3723245	eng	Don't make me come in there.
3723246	eng	It's all in there.
3723247	eng	I know you're still in there.
3723248	eng	I don't like Tom in there.
3723249	eng	I have to see who's in there.
3723250	eng	We almost bought it in there.
3723251	eng	Hey, you can't sleep there.
3723252	eng	You never know who might need something up there.
3723253	eng	I didn't make it up there.
3723254	eng	Tom's fiancée was there.
3723255	eng	That's why I was there.
3723256	eng	Tom peeked into Mary's room, but she wasn't there.
3723257	eng	I just don't see why we have to eat there.
3723258	eng	I'll let you know when I get there.
3723259	eng	I don't know how that got there.
3723260	eng	We were almost there.
3723261	eng	You were almost there.
3723262	eng	That was a good thing that just happened out there.
3723263	eng	You did pretty good out there.
3723264	eng	I wanted to see if there really was someone out there.
3723265	eng	We can't send Tom out there.
3723266	eng	It's a scorcher out there.
3723267	eng	There are wolves out there.
3723268	eng	I didn't even see you there.
3723269	eng	I can get you there.
3723270	eng	You wouldn't last a day there.
3723271	eng	Everyone has to be somewhere.
3723272	eng	Everybody has to be somewhere.
3723273	eng	I've got to be somewhere.
3723274	eng	I've got to draw the line somewhere.
3723275	eng	I knew you'd be lurking around here somewhere.
3723276	eng	It's in here somewhere.
3723277	eng	It had to come from somewhere.
3723278	eng	I'm sure I know him from somewhere.
3723279	eng	Tom has got it all written down somewhere.
3723280	eng	Tom's mind was elsewhere.
3723281	eng	Tom's mind is elsewhere.
3723282	eng	Tom was in the middle of nowhere.
3723283	eng	I don't seem to be going anywhere.
3723284	eng	It's clear Tom isn't going anywhere.
3723285	eng	Just put them anywhere.
3723286	eng	There was no sign of Tom anywhere.
3723287	eng	I can work from anywhere.
3723288	eng	I'm never going to go anywhere.
3723289	eng	I can't do it just anywhere.
3723290	eng	They seem to be everywhere.
3723291	eng	Tom knows the cops are everywhere.
3723292	eng	I've been looking everywhere.
3723293	eng	We have branches everywhere.
3723294	eng	I was at home the night of the fire.
3723295	eng	Tom was burned to death in the fire.
3723296	eng	Tom tended to the fire.
3723297	eng	Your garbage can is on fire.
3723298	eng	Tom is a new hire.
3723299	eng	Tom began to perspire.
3723300	eng	We could have anything our hearts desire.
3723301	eng	I was asked to wear a wire.
3723302	eng	We know the score.
3723303	eng	I've been down that road before.
3723304	eng	Tom looks thinner than he did before.
3723305	eng	I've never had to deal with the police before.
3723306	eng	Tom never mentioned any of this to me before.
3723307	eng	That wasn't here before.
3723308	eng	I've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.
3723309	eng	I've seen that look before.
3723310	eng	Tom has heard it all before.
3723311	eng	I've never seen Tom with a girl before.
3723312	eng	You never told me about Tom before.
3723313	eng	I'll work even harder than before.
3723314	eng	After Tom wiped the table with a dirty rag, it looked dirtier than before.
3723315	eng	I never thought along those lines before.
3723316	eng	Tom has been in tight spots before.
3723317	eng	You should've thought of that before.
3723318	eng	I'm trying to figure out where we met before.
3723319	eng	It's not like I haven't heard it before.
3723320	eng	I don't know why I didn't see it before.
3723321	eng	I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
3723322	eng	I've never had a beer in the middle of the day before.
3723323	eng	I've never been on a jury before.
3723324	eng	I guess I was expecting a little more.
3723325	eng	There's nothing that would please me more.
3723326	eng	I needed something more.
3723327	eng	Tom and Mary were friends, nothing more.
3723328	eng	Tom could say nothing more.
3723329	eng	Tom could do no more.
3723330	eng	Tom could say no more.
3723331	eng	I have a lot more.
3723332	eng	I had to know more.
3723333	eng	I've been here thirteen days, possibly more.
3723334	eng	They don't want to lose any more.
3723335	eng	It's not safe for Tom to be around me anymore.
3723336	eng	I don't practice medicine anymore.
3723337	eng	I don't think we're welcome around here anymore.
3723338	eng	I can't help myself anymore.
3723339	eng	I just don't find Tom that exciting anymore.
3723340	eng	I can't stand lying anymore.
3723341	eng	Tom isn't holding anything back anymore.
3723342	eng	I can barely sleep at all anymore.
3723343	eng	You have nothing to fear anymore.
3723344	eng	I don't think we can see each other anymore.
3723345	eng	I don't think we're right for each other anymore.
3723346	eng	Tom won't lie for you anymore.
3723347	eng	I don't know how to be happy anymore.
3723348	eng	Tom was impossible to ignore.
3723349	eng	Tom swore.
3723350	eng	Tom was insecure.
3723351	eng	A tonsillectomy is a very simple procedure.
3723352	eng	I don't need the brochure.
3723353	eng	Tom told me the project had been a failure.
3723354	eng	I needed to be sure.
3723355	eng	This is an unexpected pleasure.
3723356	eng	I don't believe I've had the pleasure.
3723357	eng	Tom has a forgiving nature.
3723358	eng	It doesn't exist in nature.
3723359	eng	Tom isn't a suspicious person by nature.
3723360	eng	The contract doesn't yet have their signature.
3723361	eng	Tom just asked me to take your temperature.
3723362	eng	Let's not paint too pretty a picture.
3723363	eng	I think you're missing the big picture.
3723364	eng	Tom has an enormous appetite for adventure.
3723365	eng	Tom says he can see into the future.
3723366	eng	I think they want to destroy the base.
3723367	eng	The opposite is the case.
3723368	eng	Tom is obviously a mental case.
3723369	eng	I'll make an exception in your case.
3723370	eng	Tom is carrying a briefcase.
3723371	eng	Don't leave me again, please.
3723372	eng	Tom aims to please.
3723373	eng	Tom examined the new purchase.
3723374	eng	Tom is just going through a phase.
3723375	eng	I always like wine and cheese.
3723376	eng	I wanted to bring you these.
3723377	eng	We're not at war with the Japanese.
3723378	eng	Let's go for Chinese.
3723379	eng	I needed the exercise.
3723380	eng	Tom never failed to keep his promise.
3723381	eng	It's a reasonable compromise.
3723382	eng	Tom made a noise.
3723383	eng	I don't know how you can put up with all this noise.
3723384	eng	Tom feigned surprise.
3723385	eng	Receiving a gift from you was an unexpected surprise.
3723386	eng	That was a fun surprise.
3723387	eng	Tom showed no surprise.
3723388	eng	Tom's face showed his surprise.
3723389	eng	I suppose I'll just have to improvise.
3723390	eng	Tom couldn't get a word in edgewise.
3723391	eng	You shouldn't feel compelled to do otherwise.
3723392	eng	The charges were false.
3723393	eng	Tom was killed someplace else.
3723394	eng	I thought you'd found someone else.
3723395	eng	I thought you had found someone else.
3723396	eng	Tom realized that Mary must be seeing someone else.
3723397	eng	I thought you were seeing someone else.
3723398	eng	I think you've confused me with someone else.
3723399	eng	I wouldn't tell that to anyone else.
3723400	eng	I won't discuss this with you or anyone else.
3723401	eng	You have the same chance as everyone else.
3723402	eng	Tom couldn't go anywhere else.
3723403	eng	You're destined for something else.
3723404	eng	Maybe they came for something else.
3723405	eng	Let me tell you something else.
3723406	eng	I'll tell you something else.
3723407	eng	You can come, but don't tell anybody else.
3723408	eng	I hated Tom more than anybody else.
3723409	eng	It'd make sense.
3723410	eng	I like things to make sense.
3723411	eng	That makes a good deal of sense.
3723412	eng	It made a lot of sense.
3723413	eng	That makes a lot of sense.
3723414	eng	Tom is devoid of common sense.
3723415	eng	It's just common sense.
3723416	eng	That's just common sense.
3723417	eng	That'd make sense.
3723418	eng	Tom just wasn't making any sense.
3723419	eng	Nothing that's happened here makes any sense.
3723420	eng	Tom was talking nonsense.
3723421	eng	I'm not going to listen to any more of this nonsense.
3723422	eng	The mood is tense.
3723423	eng	The crew is tense.
3723424	eng	Tom made no response.
3723425	eng	I've got many of those.
3723426	eng	Tom was paid to lose.
3723427	eng	There's not a moment to lose.
3723428	eng	That was too close.
3723429	eng	Boy that was close.
3723430	eng	Tom held Mary close.
3723431	eng	That's not very close.
3723432	eng	It's too risky to fight them at a place they choose.
3723433	eng	It's coming loose.
3723434	eng	Tom is about the same age as you, I suppose.
3723435	eng	Tom thinks you're doing it on purpose.
3723436	eng	You're as pale as a corpse.
3723437	eng	Tom started the car and put it in reverse.
3723438	eng	You're backing the wrong horse.
3723439	eng	You're timing couldn't have been worse.
3723440	eng	It just gets worse.
3723441	eng	I've made it worse.
3723442	eng	It only got worse.
3723443	eng	Hey, I could do a lot worse.
3723444	eng	I suppose I could do a lot worse.
3723445	eng	It can't possibly get any worse.
3723446	eng	There's no third course.
3723447	eng	You're free to go, of course.
3723448	eng	We're here tonight for a good cause.
3723449	eng	Give yourselves a round of applause.
3723450	eng	I really can't refuse.
3723451	eng	Tom heard sounds in the house.
3723452	eng	We're giving you the house.
3723453	eng	We have a warrant to search your house.
3723454	eng	I eventually located Tom's house.
3723455	eng	Tom parked the truck in front of Mary's house.
3723456	eng	Tom won't allow dogs in his house.
3723457	eng	Don't just show up at my house.
3723458	eng	Tom knows his way around the courthouse.
3723459	eng	That's open to debate.
3723460	eng	I'm playing the devil's advocate.
3723461	eng	I don't need a date.
3723462	eng	I had no idea you were on a date.
3723463	eng	Tom set me up on a date.
3723464	eng	I didn't ask you on a date.
3723465	eng	Tom is dressed for a date.
3723466	eng	Tom told me you had a blind date.
3723467	eng	I just want to have a normal date.
3723468	eng	You'd better bring Tom up to date.
3723469	eng	Tom considers himself a worthy candidate.
3723470	eng	Tom is resigned to his fate.
3723471	eng	I will accept my fate.
3723472	eng	Tom exited through the gate.
3723473	eng	I just don't feel it's appropriate.
3723474	eng	I don't think any of this is appropriate.
3723475	eng	It's just not appropriate.
3723476	eng	It was totally inappropriate.
3723477	eng	They stayed late.
3723478	eng	I guess Tom is running late.
3723479	eng	That could be too late.
3723480	eng	Tom was too late.
3723481	eng	That was why I was late.
3723482	eng	Tom didn't mention the reason he was late.
3723483	eng	Tom was hours late.
3723484	eng	I'm still running a little bit late.
3723485	eng	Tell Tom I'm sorry I made you late.
3723486	eng	Wow, it's really late.
3723487	eng	I don't need a plate.
3723488	eng	You've got a lot on your plate.
3723489	eng	Tom has got other things on his plate.
3723490	eng	Tom might not have been so fortunate.
3723491	eng	We have a lot to celebrate.
3723492	eng	Tom was so considerate.
3723493	eng	I know how you operate.
3723494	eng	Tom is clearly frustrated and desperate.
3723495	eng	It's hard to tell who's more desperate.
3723496	eng	I grew desperate.
3723497	eng	Tom isn't illiterate.
3723498	eng	I have a friend in real estate.
3723499	eng	Tom lives on his country estate.
3723500	eng	You have the body of an athlete.
3723501	eng	My happiness is complete.
3723502	eng	Tom is all bark and no bite.
3723503	eng	It's never black and white.
3723504	eng	It's not always black and white.
3723505	eng	It's not black and white.
3723506	eng	Half the suspects were white.
3723507	eng	I'm sick of white.
3723508	eng	I feel like a hypocrite.
3723509	eng	Tom glanced at the note.
3723510	eng	I came because of something you wrote.
3723511	eng	I call for a vote.
3723512	eng	I'd like to remind everyone to vote.
3723513	eng	I'm not changing my vote.
3723514	eng	Tom has excellent taste.
3723515	eng	Tom paused to have a cigarette.
3723516	eng	Tom lit another cigarette.
3723517	eng	You're incredibly cute.
3723518	eng	That was very cute.
3723519	eng	They should be out in a minute.
3723520	eng	Now you just hold on for a minute.
3723521	eng	Tom collects his thoughts for a minute.
3723522	eng	I don't believe that for a minute.
3723523	eng	Tom is growing more concerned by the minute.
3723524	eng	Tom is getting more scared by the minute.
3723525	eng	Come downstairs right this minute.
3723526	eng	Someone could walk in here any minute.
3723527	eng	There's one born every minute.
3723528	eng	There's no substitute.
3723529	eng	I don't think Tom is coming to our rescue.
3723530	eng	You're way out of my league.
3723531	eng	That's a little vague.
3723532	eng	Tom knows he's in no position to argue.
3723533	eng	Tom is in no position to argue.
3723534	eng	Tom is in the morgue.
3723535	eng	That was the first clue.
3723536	eng	It just can't be true.
3723537	eng	The rumors are true.
3723538	eng	I know it sounds crazy, but I swear it's true.
3723539	eng	But that isn't true.
3723540	eng	That simply isn't true.
3723541	eng	That's not totally true.
3723542	eng	That wasn't exactly true.
3723543	eng	You're ducking the issue.
3723544	eng	Tom knows this is a sensitive issue.
3723545	eng	It's not just a safety issue.
3723546	eng	I don't need a tissue.
3723547	eng	Tom appeared from the cave.
3723548	eng	Tom led the way into the cave.
3723549	eng	I hope you're not asking me to leave.
3723550	eng	Tom made no move to leave.
3723551	eng	I'm going to ask you both to leave.
3723552	eng	I see no reason for us to leave.
3723553	eng	I must ask you to leave.
3723554	eng	I don't know what I have.
3723555	eng	Let's be content with what we have.
3723556	eng	I'll be happy to discuss any problem you might have.
3723557	eng	That's not a choice you have.
3723558	eng	I can predict how Tom will behave.
3723559	eng	I'm not Tom's slave.
3723560	eng	Tom placed the flowers on Mary's grave.
3723561	eng	Let's save the ones we can save.
3723562	eng	I don't know what I believe.
3723563	eng	You're really good at make believe.
3723564	eng	I know it must be hard to believe.
3723565	eng	I don't know why that's hard to believe.
3723566	eng	I know what I'd like to believe.
3723567	eng	Please tell me you're not that naive.
3723568	eng	Something has to give.
3723569	eng	Tom doesn't have a lot to give.
3723570	eng	I'll remember you as long as I live.
3723571	eng	Studies have shown that the less people eat, the longer they live.
3723572	eng	You shouldn't still be alive.
3723573	eng	I'll bet we're the luckiest people alive.
3723574	eng	That's why I'm still alive.
3723575	eng	I need Tom alive.
3723576	eng	I've never felt so alive.
3723577	eng	At least we know Tom is alive.
3723578	eng	Tom will eat you alive.
3723579	eng	It's a bad time to be impulsive.
3723580	eng	I've never done anything impulsive.
3723581	eng	Tom is naturally a little defensive.
3723582	eng	We must take the offensive.
3723583	eng	Go on the offensive.
3723584	eng	I think you might be too aggressive.
3723585	eng	Tom's resume's impressive.
3723586	eng	Tom is obedient, almost submissive.
3723587	eng	Tom's very effusive.
3723588	eng	I have a lot of initiative.
3723589	eng	I just don't find you that attractive.
3723590	eng	It gives you a unique perspective.
3723591	eng	I think you've lost your perspective.
3723592	eng	Tom was always secretive.
3723593	eng	Tom is being held captive.
3723594	eng	I've always fought to survive.
3723595	eng	I think we need to replace the valve.
3723596	eng	We've only got one problem yet to solve.
3723597	eng	It's good to be in love.
3723598	eng	I'm definitely falling in love.
3723599	eng	It's the price we pay for love.
3723600	eng	I just want to feel your love.
3723601	eng	Tom is wearing a baseball glove.
3723602	eng	It's a good move.
3723603	eng	That's a good move.
3723604	eng	Tom is on the move.
3723605	eng	This is the right move.
3723606	eng	I can barely move.
3723607	eng	Tom is making soup on the stove.
3723608	eng	You've got a lot of nerve.
3723609	eng	I borrowed money from the company's cash reserve.
3723610	eng	The time has come to say goodbye.
3723611	eng	Tom can only see out of one eye.
3723612	eng	It doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye.
3723613	eng	Tom didn't even bat an eye.
3723614	eng	Tom glanced at Mary out of the corner of his eye.
3723615	eng	Tom has a patch over his left eye.
3723616	eng	I told you the interview would be a breeze.
3723617	eng	I want you to meet my new squeeze.
3723618	eng	You've got to apologize.
3723619	eng	Tom made no effort to apologize.
3723620	eng	I came by to apologize.
3723621	eng	Tom might at least apologize.
3723622	eng	You know me better than you realize.
3723623	eng	I need you more than you can possibly realize.
3723624	eng	You're the one who's tone deaf.
3723625	eng	Tom was gagged with a handkerchief.
3723626	eng	Tom blew his nose in a handkerchief.
3723627	eng	Tom coughed into his handkerchief.
3723628	eng	Tom seemed to be up to some mischief.
3723629	eng	Tom shook his head in disbelief.
3723630	eng	Everyone stared at Tom in disbelief.
3723631	eng	Tom narrowed his eyes in disbelief.
3723632	eng	This is such a relief.
3723633	eng	Tom sighed with relief.
3723634	eng	Tom's face showed his relief.
3723635	eng	I'll make this brief.
3723636	eng	I'll make this very brief.
3723637	eng	It would be dangerous to go too near the edge of the cliff.
3723638	eng	Tom began to sniff.
3723639	eng	I hear the competition is pretty stiff.
3723640	eng	Tom is pretty bad off.
3723641	eng	Tom stormed off.
3723642	eng	They shoved off.
3723643	eng	I think we'd better be off.
3723644	eng	Call your people off.
3723645	eng	Tom's classmates are goofing off.
3723646	eng	Tom couldn't help showing off.
3723647	eng	You ticked them off.
3723648	eng	Tom was definitely bought off.
3723649	eng	Tom is still reluctant to call it off.
3723650	eng	Tom might be able to pull it off.
3723651	eng	Tom will be all right once he sleeps it off.
3723652	eng	I didn't rip you off.
3723653	eng	They blew you off.
3723654	eng	You were told to lay off.
3723655	eng	I like to sleep in the buff.
3723656	eng	I'm not really into that kind of stuff.
3723657	eng	Tom's desk is covered with stuff.
3723658	eng	This is emotional stuff.
3723659	eng	I see you haven't forgotten your stuff.
3723660	eng	You know your stuff.
3723661	eng	I need help with this stuff.
3723662	eng	That's your half.
3723663	eng	Tom braced himself.
3723664	eng	Tom could've kicked himself.
3723665	eng	Tom helped himself.
3723666	eng	Tom cursed himself.
3723667	eng	Tom hated himself.
3723668	eng	Tom tried to prepare himself.
3723669	eng	Tom took a breath and tried to compose himself.
3723670	eng	Tom took a moment to compose himself.
3723671	eng	Tom was ashamed of himself.
3723672	eng	Tom was sure of himself.
3723673	eng	Tom seems very full of himself.
3723674	eng	Tom was defending himself.
3723675	eng	Tom looks pleased with himself.
3723676	eng	Tom is looking very pleased with himself.
3723677	eng	Tom's very pleased with himself.
3723678	eng	Tom seems very pleased with himself.
3723679	eng	Tom is going to kill himself.
3723680	eng	Tom lost confidence in himself.
3723681	eng	Tom couldn't contain himself.
3723682	eng	Tom snickered to himself.
3723683	eng	Tom has this large room to himself.
3723684	eng	Tom can't seem to help himself.
3723685	eng	Tom knew he was crossing the line, but he couldn't help himself.
3723686	eng	Tom is too weak to look after himself.
3723687	eng	Tom said he wished to speak to you himself.
3723688	eng	I couldn't just leave Tom there by himself.
3723689	eng	You're not so bad yourself.
3723690	eng	I liked the way you handled yourself.
3723691	eng	You're no prize yourself.
3723692	eng	I hope you're proud of yourself.
3723693	eng	You must be kicking yourself.
3723694	eng	Don't make this harder on yourself.
3723695	eng	You can have this room all to yourself.
3723696	eng	Just keep to yourself.
3723697	eng	You can't help yourself.
3723698	eng	Please cover yourself.
3723699	eng	Just see for yourself.
3723700	eng	You can make it easier for yourself.
3723701	eng	You may have to do this yourself.
3723702	eng	Just look at yourself.
3723703	eng	You even said that yourself.
3723704	eng	I'm glad you figured that out yourself.
3723705	eng	I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
3723706	eng	The cycle is repeating itself.
3723707	eng	You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
3723708	eng	Frankly, I'm not sure it really happened myself.
3723709	eng	Tom, this is between your father and myself.
3723710	eng	I can drive myself.
3723711	eng	I have to think of myself.
3723712	eng	I was defending myself.
3723713	eng	I've only been fooling myself.
3723714	eng	I can live with myself.
3723715	eng	I haven't been honest with myself.
3723716	eng	I don't have to explain myself.
3723717	eng	I'm quite capable of explaining the situation myself.
3723718	eng	I smiled to myself.
3723719	eng	I figured that much out for myself.
3723720	eng	I'm going to have to try and handle this myself.
3723721	eng	I'm going to handle this myself.
3723722	eng	I'm only beginning to understand it myself.
3723723	eng	I never really understood it myself.
3723724	eng	I can figure it out myself.
3723725	eng	I could kill you myself.
3723726	eng	I don't know what they're capable of.
3723727	eng	Tom doesn't have any enemies I can't think of.
3723728	eng	I had a last-minute meeting I couldn't get out of.
3723729	eng	Tom was aloof.
3723730	eng	I need solid proof.
3723731	eng	The cat's already out of the bag.
3723732	eng	Mary rummaged through her bag.
3723733	eng	Tom is a scumbag.
3723734	eng	It's a great gag.
3723735	eng	Tom was waving a flag.
3723736	eng	Shake a leg.
3723737	eng	Tom lost a leg.
3723738	eng	Last one in is a rotten egg.
3723739	eng	Last one out is a rotten egg.
3723740	eng	I knew it was pretty big.
3723741	eng	You're a disgusting pig.
3723742	eng	You're a lying pig.
3723743	eng	They think we're a gang.
3723744	eng	Tom needed help with the plumbing.
3723745	eng	This is very disturbing.
3723746	eng	Tom resumed his pacing.
3723747	eng	You'll wear yourself out with all that pacing.
3723748	eng	It doesn't look too convincing.
3723749	eng	Tom knows where this is heading.
3723750	eng	I know where this is leading.
3723751	eng	I'm usually better at reading.
3723752	eng	I might need some persuading.
3723753	eng	I don't know if there's going to be a wedding.
3723754	eng	That's quite a secret you've been hiding.
3723755	eng	Somebody tried to blow up our office building.
3723756	eng	I can't believe you live in that building.
3723757	eng	I'm glad we were able to come to an understanding.
3723758	eng	I don't require your understanding.
3723759	eng	Tom isn't good at pretending.
3723760	eng	I've done some bartending.
3723761	eng	My ears were pounding.
3723762	eng	The alarm started ringing.
3723763	eng	Tom makes his living by singing.
3723764	eng	Tom could hear steps approaching.
3723765	eng	I've done some soul-searching.
3723766	eng	Tom's left eye started twitching.
3723767	eng	Tom began laughing.
3723768	eng	Tom looked so funny that I couldn't help laughing.
3723769	eng	You look positively ravishing.
3723770	eng	I don't see any reason for rushing.
3723771	eng	Tom is capable of doing such a thing.
3723772	eng	Tom knew better than to say such a thing.
3723773	eng	We'll not tell you a thing.
3723774	eng	I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
3723775	eng	That's probably a good thing.
3723776	eng	Tom felt very uncomfortable about the whole thing.
3723777	eng	Tom orchestrated this whole thing.
3723778	eng	Anybody else would have done the same thing.
3723779	eng	That isn't the same thing.
3723780	eng	I could ask you the same thing.
3723781	eng	Ask me again and I'll tell you the same thing.
3723782	eng	I could say the same thing.
3723783	eng	Promise me one thing.
3723784	eng	This all adds up to one thing.
3723785	eng	We want one thing.
3723786	eng	Tom was correct about one thing.
3723787	eng	You're right about one thing.
3723788	eng	Tom was right about one thing.
3723789	eng	I think some people do that kind of thing.
3723790	eng	You just said the wrong thing.
3723791	eng	There's no such thing.
3723792	eng	I didn't do any such thing.
3723793	eng	Simulations can't always prepare you for the real thing.
3723794	eng	I don't want you to do another thing.
3723795	eng	We're just waiting for Tom to do his thing.
3723796	eng	You've done a marvelous thing.
3723797	eng	It's not too late to do the right thing.
3723798	eng	I know it's the right thing.
3723799	eng	I think Tom has stopped breathing.
3723800	eng	I thought you jury-rigged something.
3723801	eng	Tom has indeed found something.
3723802	eng	I think we found something.
3723803	eng	You said Tom asked you to ask me something.
3723804	eng	Tom was trying to tell me something.
3723805	eng	You were about to tell me something.
3723806	eng	I need you to tell me something.
3723807	eng	You are something.
3723808	eng	Tom could sense something.
3723809	eng	Tom asked if I felt like cooking something.
3723810	eng	Don't tell me you weren't doing something.
3723811	eng	I feel like I'm forgetting something.
3723812	eng	I just want to feel something.
3723813	eng	It's got to mean something.
3723814	eng	At least we all agree on something.
3723815	eng	Tom was munching on something.
3723816	eng	I'm on to something.
3723817	eng	Tom is obviously distressed over something.
3723818	eng	Tom was looking under the couch cushions for something.
3723819	eng	I need to confess something.
3723820	eng	Maybe that'll tell us something.
3723821	eng	Maybe somebody's trying to tell us something.
3723822	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom was trying to tell us something.
3723823	eng	It might tell us something.
3723824	eng	I still think I can get something.
3723825	eng	I knew I felt something.
3723826	eng	Tell me you've got something.
3723827	eng	Tom seems very uncomfortable about something.
3723828	eng	I needed to speak to you about something.
3723829	eng	I need to speak to you about something.
3723830	eng	That should tell you something.
3723831	eng	You and I both know you saw something.
3723832	eng	Call me when you know something.
3723833	eng	I had to say something.
3723834	eng	You were about to say something.
3723835	eng	Tom is clearly troubled by something.
3723836	eng	Tom seems to be puzzled by something.
3723837	eng	Tom is perplexed by something.
3723838	eng	Tom was dressed in casual clothing.
3723839	eng	Tom denied nothing.
3723840	eng	The fight had settled nothing.
3723841	eng	Tom heard nothing.
3723842	eng	Without me, you would be nothing.
3723843	eng	We could see nothing.
3723844	eng	Tom could see nothing.
3723845	eng	They could see nothing.
3723846	eng	Tom ate nothing.
3723847	eng	We could end up with nothing.
3723848	eng	Beyond that, I told Tom nothing.
3723849	eng	Tom could do nothing.
3723850	eng	I just think you're getting worked up over nothing.
3723851	eng	Tom is good for nothing.
3723852	eng	I thought you said it was nothing.
3723853	eng	I'm sure it was nothing.
3723854	eng	Tom has got nothing.
3723855	eng	Give a yell if you need anything.
3723856	eng	I can call my girlfriend anything.
3723857	eng	Give a shout if you see anything.
3723858	eng	We're not even sure Tom is guilty of anything.
3723859	eng	It's not like we're doing anything.
3723860	eng	I'm afraid to touch anything.
3723861	eng	Tom hasn't being charged with anything.
3723862	eng	Try not to steal anything.
3723863	eng	It's too early to tell anything.
3723864	eng	Nobody could tell Tom anything.
3723865	eng	It could mean anything.
3723866	eng	I realized I still hadn't eaten anything.
3723867	eng	I never had to order Tom to do anything.
3723868	eng	Tom wasn't really trying to convince Mary to do anything.
3723869	eng	I'm never going to amount to anything.
3723870	eng	Tom hasn't picked up anything.
3723871	eng	Tom may not have to give up anything.
3723872	eng	I'm not charging anybody for anything.
3723873	eng	Tom is capable of almost anything.
3723874	eng	Nobody's trying to tell you anything.
3723875	eng	That's why I never tell you anything.
3723876	eng	I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
3723877	eng	This isn't going to fix anything.
3723878	eng	You can't say anything.
3723879	eng	Nobody's going to try anything.
3723880	eng	Tom noticed everything.
3723881	eng	That has changed everything.
3723882	eng	It's a pity you destroyed everything.
3723883	eng	Some people have to be told everything.
3723884	eng	You can't see everything.
3723885	eng	I'm going to make everything.
3723886	eng	That should solve everything.
3723887	eng	I've been trying everything.
3723888	eng	Tom has a plan for everything.
3723889	eng	That's Tom's answer for everything.
3723890	eng	Tom uses sports metaphors for everything.
3723891	eng	People tell doctors everything.
3723892	eng	You're going to tell us everything.
3723893	eng	I'm not saying that you have to tell me about everything.
3723894	eng	I'm telling you everything.
3723895	eng	You're my everything.
3723896	eng	Your hand is shaking.
3723897	eng	Tom is doing a little matchmaking.
3723898	eng	You and I shouldn't be talking.
3723899	eng	That's your pride talking.
3723900	eng	Hey, now we're talking.
3723901	eng	There's been enough talking.
3723902	eng	You've got to get Tom talking.
3723903	eng	Please refrain from talking.
3723904	eng	Listen to who's talking.
3723905	eng	The other kids aren't talking.
3723906	eng	People will start talking.
3723907	eng	I've been doing some thinking.
3723908	eng	I know you know what I'm thinking.
3723909	eng	Listen, I've been thinking.
3723910	eng	I can't imagine what Tom was thinking.
3723911	eng	Tom suddenly realized what Mary was thinking.
3723912	eng	Tom spoke without thinking.
3723913	eng	The light was blinking.
3723914	eng	They were out late drinking.
3723915	eng	Tom says he's gotten complaints about you drinking.
3723916	eng	Tom has made up his mind to quit smoking.
3723917	eng	Tom is an expert when it comes to cooking.
3723918	eng	You're really tall and good-looking.
3723919	eng	I assume that your phone is still not working.
3723920	eng	I don't think you know what you're asking.
3723921	eng	That's all I'm asking.
3723922	eng	You know what I'm asking.
3723923	eng	Pardon me for asking.
3723924	eng	Tom cut the cards and started dealing.
3723925	eng	It does sound appealing.
3723926	eng	I just had a weird feeling.
3723927	eng	It gave me a nice feeling.
3723928	eng	I don't need any counseling.
3723929	eng	I think you've finally found your calling.
3723930	eng	It looks like you finally found your calling.
3723931	eng	I can smell what you're smelling.
3723932	eng	Tom's left arm is in a sling.
3723933	eng	Keep hustling.
3723934	eng	This is quite puzzling.
3723935	eng	Tom woke from his nightmare, screaming.
3723936	eng	The crowd was screaming.
3723937	eng	You should've seen that one coming.
3723938	eng	Someone knew we were coming.
3723939	eng	I told Tom we should've contacted you before coming.
3723940	eng	I tried to tell Tom we should've contacted you before coming.
3723941	eng	I know it's coming.
3723942	eng	You all had this coming.
3723943	eng	It's not like you didn't see this coming.
3723944	eng	I guess I should've seen this coming.
3723945	eng	You should've seen this coming.
3723946	eng	I never saw that coming.
3723947	eng	Tom had it coming.
3723948	eng	I really didn't see it coming.
3723949	eng	You should've seen it coming.
3723950	eng	Tom thought he was really charming.
3723951	eng	That's what I find alarming.
3723952	eng	The noise is deafening.
3723953	eng	This is where it's all happening.
3723954	eng	We understand what's happening.
3723955	eng	Tom couldn't quite believe what was happening.
3723956	eng	I should've anticipated this happening.
3723957	eng	I don't really see that happening.
3723958	eng	I don't think there's much chance of that happening.
3723959	eng	It sounds downright frightening.
3723960	eng	I don't see any customers complaining.
3723961	eng	I should've told you the truth about me from the beginning.
3723962	eng	I've been warning them from the beginning.
3723963	eng	It's still functioning.
3723964	eng	I spend time with Tom because he's interested in learning.
3723965	eng	I'll have Tom at your office first thing in the morning.
3723966	eng	The documents will be on your desk in the morning.
3723967	eng	My car will pick you up in the morning.
3723968	eng	Tom may be dead before morning.
3723969	eng	I've been humming that tune to myself all morning.
3723970	eng	Tom puttered around in the garden all morning.
3723971	eng	I knew I shouldn't have answered the phone this morning.
3723972	eng	Tom drinks, but he's not drunk this morning.
3723973	eng	I received a coded message from Tom this morning.
3723974	eng	It was in the paper this morning.
3723975	eng	We had some words this morning.
3723976	eng	Tom sent me roses this morning.
3723977	eng	Tom evidently was here early this morning.
3723978	eng	Have Tom report here tomorrow morning.
3723979	eng	I'll ask Tom to make some time for you tomorrow morning.
3723980	eng	I'll have the results by tomorrow morning.
3723981	eng	I want you out of our apartment by morning.
3723982	eng	I don't want you eating donuts every morning.
3723983	eng	I'm glad to see your sense of humor returning.
3723984	eng	We must know exactly what we're doing.
3723985	eng	Please think about what you're doing.
3723986	eng	I don't know what they think they're doing.
3723987	eng	I came by to see how you were doing.
3723988	eng	That's just what I'm doing.
3723989	eng	This is your own doing.
3723990	eng	I think I'll pop in on Tom and see how he's doing.
3723991	eng	That's what I was doing.
3723992	eng	I can tell you what I'm not doing.
3723993	eng	I can't see where we're going.
3723994	eng	It's as far as we're going.
3723995	eng	That's where I'm going.
3723996	eng	That's why I'm going.
3723997	eng	Tom knew right where he was going.
3723998	eng	I know where this is going.
3723999	eng	This isn't exactly helping.
3724000	eng	I'm always in the mood for shopping.
3724001	eng	You have very acute hearing.
3724002	eng	I know what you're offering.
3724003	eng	I can end your suffering.
3724004	eng	Tom's confidence is wavering.
3724005	eng	I didn't know you were hiring.
3724006	eng	I already know they're not hiring.
3724007	eng	It just sounds boring.
3724008	eng	Dinner was incredibly boring.
3724009	eng	It's not easy to think with Tom snoring.
3724010	eng	Tom may need some doctoring.
3724011	eng	Tom is quite enterprising.
3724012	eng	Tom is incapable of losing.
3724013	eng	It's a little embarrassing.
3724014	eng	Now, that's just embarrassing.
3724015	eng	You need to stop obsessing.
3724016	eng	We ended up kissing.
3724017	eng	No one named Tom Jackson has been reported missing.
3724018	eng	One of them is still missing.
3724019	eng	There's a girl missing.
3724020	eng	It was very confusing.
3724021	eng	That was really quite amusing.
3724022	eng	It's amusing.
3724023	eng	Tom is a person of interest in a case we're investigating.
3724024	eng	That's certainly worth investigating.
3724025	eng	That's what I'm investigating.
3724026	eng	This is really humiliating.
3724027	eng	Today has been exhilarating.
3724028	eng	I can't believe you're graduating.
3724029	eng	I know it seems like I'm overreacting.
3724030	eng	Well, Tom, you aren't what I was expecting.
3724031	eng	I know who you're protecting.
3724032	eng	I knew you didn't have a meeting.
3724033	eng	Tom was asked not to speak at the meeting.
3724034	eng	Tom and I have a dinner meeting.
3724035	eng	I had no way of knowing who Tom was meeting.
3724036	eng	Dinner will be waiting.
3724037	eng	Tom was waiting.
3724038	eng	Tom sat waiting.
3724039	eng	I'm definitely not waiting.
3724040	eng	Tom has a talent for writing.
3724041	eng	It's a small price to pay for such a nice painting.
3724042	eng	You were wrong about the painting.
3724043	eng	Tom really likes your painting.
3724044	eng	Tom has agreed to pay a rather steep price for that painting.
3724045	eng	I don't think you realize what you're suggesting.
3724046	eng	I just realized something interesting.
3724047	eng	Tom has indeed found something interesting.
3724048	eng	I don't find it that interesting.
3724049	eng	You're evil and disgusting.
3724050	eng	Your problem is that you've always been too trusting.
3724051	eng	That's what I'm betting.
3724052	eng	Well, that's upsetting.
3724053	eng	Don't tell me you're quitting.
3724054	eng	You'll get nowhere by shouting.
3724055	eng	They were arguing.
3724056	eng	Every life is worth saving.
3724057	eng	I'm not worth saving.
3724058	eng	Tom works for a living.
3724059	eng	That's how Tom makes his living.
3724060	eng	I'm not the one doing the driving.
3724061	eng	Tom is in the process of moving.
3724062	eng	That's really a good carving.
3724063	eng	Tom sort of took me under his wing.
3724064	eng	I can see which way the wind's blowing.
3724065	eng	There was soft music playing.
3724066	eng	My friend here will be paying.
3724067	eng	Maybe it's a price worth paying.
3724068	eng	Tom began praying.
3724069	eng	Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
3724070	eng	I don't think you realize what you're saying.
3724071	eng	That's all I'm saying.
3724072	eng	That's what I'm saying.
3724073	eng	I haven't heard that particular saying.
3724074	eng	Tom means exactly the opposite of what he's saying.
3724075	eng	They're all either dead or dying.
3724076	eng	It's very gratifying.
3724077	eng	You know I don't like lying.
3724078	eng	I'm not saying Tom is lying.
3724079	eng	You'll be interested to hear that Tom thinks I'm hardly ever annoying.
3724080	eng	The girls were crying.
3724081	eng	Tom just can't stop crying.
3724082	eng	Tom tried to comfort Mary, but she kept crying.
3724083	eng	Now isn't the time to start worrying.
3724084	eng	I don't see any reason for hurrying.
3724085	eng	What's important is that you're trying.
3724086	eng	Hey, I'm still trying.
3724087	eng	You can't blame a girl for trying.
3724088	eng	That'd be amazing.
3724089	eng	I'm going to show you something amazing.
3724090	eng	It was absolutely amazing.
3724091	eng	I've been hearing that for a long time.
3724092	eng	That would take too long.
3724093	eng	It'll take too long.
3724094	eng	Tom has been sitting behind that desk too long.
3724095	eng	I think you've been in this town too long.
3724096	eng	I told you Tom had been on duty too long.
3724097	eng	You've been gone for so long.
3724098	eng	I wondered what was taking you so long.
3724099	eng	OK, people, move along.
3724100	eng	I think we'll tag along.
3724101	eng	Hey, that's what I've been saying all along.
3724102	eng	Tom has been lying all along.
3724103	eng	I've been with Tom all along.
3724104	eng	Tom is making it up as he goes along.
3724105	eng	You two would get along.
3724106	eng	I wouldn't play along.
3724107	eng	That's where you belong.
3724108	eng	I know Tom comes on a little strong.
3724109	eng	It made me strong.
3724110	eng	You don't have to be so strong.
3724111	eng	Tom is short, but he's strong.
3724112	eng	It's dead wrong.
3724113	eng	Don't be embarrassed to be wrong.
3724114	eng	Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.
3724115	eng	I've found nothing wrong.
3724116	eng	You've got me all wrong.
3724117	eng	That's just plain wrong.
3724118	eng	It just seems so wrong.
3724119	eng	Tom has never been one to admit that he's wrong.
3724120	eng	Tom was almost hoping he was wrong.
3724121	eng	Tom isn't about to admit he was wrong.
3724122	eng	You didn't tell me what was wrong.
3724123	eng	It feels wrong.
3724124	eng	Of course, you weren't wrong.
3724125	eng	Tom was invariably wrong.
3724126	eng	That was a really pretty song.
3724127	eng	Tom and Mary were young.
3724128	eng	The day's still young.
3724129	eng	It's a shame this had to happen to you so young.
3724130	eng	The crowd is young.
3724131	eng	I'm pulling the plug.
3724132	eng	Tom is lying face down on a rug.
3724133	eng	When I was in prison, I dreamed of the beach.
3724134	eng	The last place anyone saw Tom was at the beach.
3724135	eng	I already have butterflies in my stomach.
3724136	eng	Tom says he can't work on an empty stomach.
3724137	eng	I chose the wrong approach.
3724138	eng	I've often wondered what it must be like to be rich.
3724139	eng	There's more to life than just getting rich.
3724140	eng	Tom let out a belch.
3724141	eng	Tom and Mary sat together on the bench.
3724142	eng	Tom seems intent on mastering French.
3724143	eng	Tom is progressing in French.
3724144	eng	Tom and Mary were speaking softly in French.
3724145	eng	I highly doubt Tom knows any French.
3724146	eng	Tom complained of the stench.
3724147	eng	That'll do in a pinch.
3724148	eng	I had a drink with lunch.
3724149	eng	This will hold me until lunch.
3724150	eng	I'm still free for lunch.
3724151	eng	You're on your own for lunch.
3724152	eng	We can work on it at lunch.
3724153	eng	Tom beat us to the punch.
3724154	eng	There's always a catch.
3724155	eng	Tom is quite the catch.
3724156	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to get into a shouting match.
3724157	eng	You've met your match.
3724158	eng	I'll take the first watch.
3724159	eng	I'll take first watch.
3724160	eng	I don't see why we can't just watch.
3724161	eng	There's another hitch.
3724162	eng	Let's take it down a notch.
3724163	eng	I know I haven't been around much.
3724164	eng	It doesn't look like much.
3724165	eng	It doesn't bother me much.
3724166	eng	I don't think that would bother Tom too much.
3724167	eng	I don't like to plan too much.
3724168	eng	Tom is a nice guy, except that he talks too much.
3724169	eng	This is just too much.
3724170	eng	I can only take so much.
3724171	eng	You give me so much.
3724172	eng	You've done so much.
3724173	eng	I never knew I needed you so much.
3724174	eng	Tom loves you so much.
3724175	eng	I suspected as much.
3724176	eng	I had suspected as much.
3724177	eng	I don't think the world has changed that much.
3724178	eng	I never minded all that much.
3724179	eng	I didn't learn very much.
3724180	eng	Tom liked Mary very much.
3724181	eng	Tom slumped on the couch.
3724182	eng	The cotton is high.
3724183	eng	Tom gave a sigh.
3724184	eng	Tom said that for the laugh.
3724185	eng	You're the only one who can make me laugh.
3724186	eng	It's important to laugh.
3724187	eng	I think you've helped enough.
3724188	eng	I've suffered enough.
3724189	eng	That better be good enough.
3724190	eng	I'm just not good enough.
3724191	eng	Frankly, Tom didn't try hard enough.
3724192	eng	That seems simple enough.
3724193	eng	That's long enough.
3724194	eng	I'm well enough.
3724195	eng	I think we know each other well enough.
3724196	eng	I don't hear that often enough.
3724197	eng	That's not soon enough.
3724198	eng	I guess I'll find out soon enough.
3724199	eng	It looks harmless enough.
3724200	eng	Sometimes that just isn't enough.
3724201	eng	That's a little rough.
3724202	eng	Tom's promotion came through.
3724203	eng	I want you to tell me what you're going through.
3724204	eng	I'm not unsympathetic about what you're going through.
3724205	eng	I think you'll pull through.
3724206	eng	I can appreciate what you've been through.
3724207	eng	I know exactly what you went through.
3724208	eng	You wanted to get your mom back for everything she put you through.
3724209	eng	We're only halfway through.
3724210	eng	I hear the competition is tough.
3724211	eng	Tom was staring at a photograph.
3724212	eng	Tom has got Mary on a tight leash.
3724213	eng	I came by to feed Tom's fish.
3724214	eng	I know I'm being selfish.
3724215	eng	Now isn't the time to get squeamish.
3724216	eng	Use whatever you wish.
3724217	eng	Believe whatever you wish.
3724218	eng	That was very harsh.
3724219	eng	It was an ambush.
3724220	eng	Come on, Tom, you're making me blush.
3724221	eng	You're going to need a push.
3724222	eng	I already gave the children their bath.
3724223	eng	The punishment for Tom shall be death.
3724224	eng	I've seen my share of death.
3724225	eng	It scares me to death.
3724226	eng	They tortured my father to death.
3724227	eng	It looks like Tom was shot to death.
3724228	eng	I didn't have anything to do with Tom's death.
3724229	eng	I assume you heard about Tom's death.
3724230	eng	I thought you might be out of breath.
3724231	eng	They're out of breath.
3724232	eng	Tom drew a long breath.
3724233	eng	Tom drew a deep breath.
3724234	eng	Tom drew a sharp breath.
3724235	eng	Tom drew in his breath.
3724236	eng	I won't hold my breath.
3724237	eng	Let's do the math.
3724238	eng	Let Tom find his own path.
3724239	eng	I had to find my own path.
3724240	eng	I chose another path.
3724241	eng	I'll take this path.
3724242	eng	Tom was lying through his teeth.
3724243	eng	Tom is lying through his teeth.
3724244	eng	Tom began to brush his teeth.
3724245	eng	I guess we're not on the same wavelength.
3724246	eng	I need someone who I can feel safe with.
3724247	eng	I just want it over and done with.
3724248	eng	It's nothing that I can't cope with.
3724249	eng	It's just something I have to live with.
3724250	eng	I forgot who I was dealing with.
3724251	eng	I don't date women I work with.
3724252	eng	You live next to somebody I work with.
3724253	eng	I didn't have much to work with.
3724254	eng	I don't have much to work with.
3724255	eng	Tom is the one I deal with.
3724256	eng	We've got an issue to deal with.
3724257	eng	Listen, we have a bigger problem to deal with.
3724258	eng	The social problems facing them seem too enormous to deal with.
3724259	eng	I have an experiment I need help with.
3724260	eng	I'll see what I can come up with.
3724261	eng	I just want to get this over with.
3724262	eng	You're grounded for a month.
3724263	eng	I've rented a room in Boston for a month.
3724264	eng	Tom is going away for a month.
3724265	eng	I'll be moving out at the end of the month.
3724266	eng	I've been burgled three times this month.
3724267	eng	I know this is an upsetting time for you both.
3724268	deu	Ich werde am Ende des Monats ausziehen.
3724269	deu	Bei mir wurde in diesem Monat schon dreimal eingebrochen.
3724270	deu	Manchmal reicht das einfach nicht.
3724271	deu	Ich habe mich schon oft gefragt, wie es wohl sein muss, reich zu sein.
3724272	deu	Tom beklagte sich wegen des Gestankes.
3724273	deu	Tom ist ein netter Kerl, nur dass er zu viel redet.
3724274	deu	Ihr beiden kämet gut miteinander aus.
3724275	deu	Tom ist klein, aber stark.
3724276	deu	Das ist grundverkehrt.
3724277	deu	Als ich im Gefängnis war, träumte ich vom Strand.
3724278	deu	Tom meint genau das Gegenteil von dem, was er sagt.
3724279	deu	Die Mädchen weinten.
3724280	epo	La knabinoj ploris.
3724281	deu	Wichtig ist, dass du es versuchst.
3724282	deu	Wichtig ist, dass ihr es versucht.
3724283	deu	Wichtig ist, dass Sie es versuchen.
3724284	deu	Das würde zu lange dauern.
3724285	deu	He, das sage ich doch schon die ganze Zeit.
3724286	deu	Tom hat die ganze Zeit gelogen.
3724287	deu	Das werde ich wohl früh genug erfahren.
3724289	deu	Besonders viel habe ich nicht gelernt.
3724290	deu	Tom hat dich superdoll lieb.
3724291	nah	Ahtleh omochiuh.
3724292	deu	Das hatte ich bereits vermutet.
3724293	deu	Das ist einfach zu viel.
3724294	deu	Ich bin gekommen, um Toms Fische zu füttern.
3724295	eng	Tom has got quite a mouth.
3724296	eng	Something's coming out of your mouth.
3724297	eng	You're obliged to tell me the truth.
3724298	eng	Go with the truth.
3724299	eng	The main thing is to tell the truth.
3724300	eng	I just tell the truth.
3724301	eng	Tom didn't exactly tell the truth.
3724302	eng	The time has come to tell Tom the truth.
3724303	eng	I'm just trying to uncover the truth.
3724304	eng	They wouldn't allow me to tell you the truth.
3724305	eng	I couldn't tell you the truth.
3724306	eng	I couldn't let Tom know the truth.
3724307	eng	We already know the truth.
3724308	eng	You already know the truth.
3724309	eng	I came by to say hi.
3724310	eng	Tom makes an excellent martini.
3724311	eng	Tom hailed a cruising taxi.
3724312	eng	That'll stop the leak.
3724313	eng	You're no longer allowed to speak.
3724314	eng	Speak when you're told to speak.
3724315	eng	Tom forced himself to speak.
3724316	eng	Tom is still too out of breath to speak.
3724317	eng	Tom opened his mouth to speak.
3724318	eng	Tom wanted Mary to speak.
3724319	eng	Tom still didn't speak.
3724320	eng	Tom is so stunned he can hardly speak.
3724321	eng	I just can't catch a break.
3724322	eng	We got a break.
3724323	eng	You're entitled to a lunch break.
3724324	eng	Never give a sucker an even break.
3724325	eng	I could really go for a steak.
3724326	eng	You've always been weak.
3724327	eng	Tom was too weak.
3724328	eng	Tom has lost a lot of blood and he's weak.
3724329	eng	I just want my job back.
3724330	eng	Tom smiled back.
3724331	eng	Tom stepped back.
3724332	eng	I can be laid back.
3724333	eng	Lift with the legs, not with the back.
3724334	eng	Tom patted me on the back.
3724335	eng	That's why I came back.
3724336	eng	It's all coming back.
3724337	eng	You'll get them back.
3724338	eng	I just want my career back.
3724339	eng	I'm not doing anything behind your back.
3724340	eng	Please place your hands behind your back.
3724341	eng	Tom needs to know we've got his back.
3724342	eng	I just thought that you might want to have this back.
3724343	eng	I want you out of the office by the time I get back.
3724344	eng	We'll settle this when I get back.
3724345	eng	I promise I'll give it back.
3724346	eng	Tom took a pistol out of his shoulder holster, checked it and put it back.
3724347	eng	It's great having you back.
3724348	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get you back.
3724349	eng	Tom and I go a long way back.
3724350	eng	We go way back.
3724351	eng	I think Tom should ask for his money back.
3724352	eng	I just want my family back.
3724353	eng	I think I just hurt my back.
3724354	eng	We've suffered a minor setback.
3724355	eng	I think you should cut Tom some slack.
3724356	eng	I'm going to build you a spice rack.
3724357	eng	The door opened a crack.
3724358	eng	Tom packed some essentials into his knapsack.
3724359	eng	We'd never survive another attack.
3724360	eng	We must continue our attack.
3724361	eng	Tom would probably have a heart attack.
3724362	eng	You'll have to pick up the check.
3724363	eng	I'll double check.
3724364	eng	I'd like to do a feasibility check.
3724365	eng	I ought to break your neck.
3724366	eng	Tom is a total wreck.
3724367	eng	It's a gimmick.
3724368	eng	It could've been a trick.
3724369	eng	That was a dirty trick.
3724370	eng	Tom will be worried sick.
3724371	eng	You've had me worried sick.
3724372	eng	If I eat any more, I'll be sick.
3724373	eng	This stuff makes me sick.
3724374	eng	You're making us all sick.
3724375	eng	Tom said that the mere sight of Mary made him sick.
3724376	eng	I want to prove to you that I'm not sick.
3724377	eng	I feel like Tom got the short end of the stick.
3724378	eng	Get in here quick.
3724379	eng	You catch on quick.
3724380	eng	I'll make this quick.
3724381	eng	I can make this quick.
3724382	eng	Tom is almost in shock.
3724383	eng	Circle the block.
3724384	eng	I'm off the clock.
3724385	eng	You missed your ten o'clock.
3724386	eng	I suggest you duck.
3724387	eng	I just wanted to stop by and wish you good luck.
3724388	eng	Tom has had an incredible run of luck.
3724389	eng	I think we're in luck.
3724390	eng	I make my own luck.
3724391	eng	You're pushing your luck.
3724392	eng	I thought I'd stop by and wish you luck.
3724393	eng	I couldn't believe my luck.
3724394	eng	I admire your pluck.
3724395	eng	Tom climbs into the driver's seat of the truck.
3724396	eng	I've eaten enough for a week.
3724397	eng	Tom and May agreed to trade places for a week.
3724398	eng	Tom will be gone by the end of the week.
3724399	eng	We need you to tell us why you were absent all last week.
3724400	eng	That was last week.
3724401	eng	I knew people would talk.
3724402	eng	We ended up having a really good talk.
3724403	eng	We'll have a nice long talk.
3724404	eng	Tom must be made to talk.
3724405	eng	This is a bad time for me to talk.
3724406	eng	Tom is here to talk.
3724407	eng	People are going to talk.
3724408	eng	People are starting to talk.
3724409	eng	Tom smiled at me and we began to talk.
3724410	eng	It's your fault I can't talk.
3724411	eng	I don't see why we can't talk.
3724412	eng	They couldn't talk.
3724413	eng	You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet talk.
3724414	eng	I just thought I'd take a walk.
3724415	eng	Tom settled his account with the bank.
3724416	eng	You can take that to the bank.
3724417	eng	I didn't rob any bank.
3724418	eng	Tom's face suddenly went blank.
3724419	eng	Tom ate and drank.
3724420	eng	That was pretty cool, I think.
3724421	eng	I don't know what I think.
3724422	eng	Tom wasn't sure what to think.
3724423	eng	That's what Tom wanted you to think.
3724424	eng	I don't pay you to think.
3724425	eng	You're better than you think.
3724426	eng	I'm back in the pink.
3724427	eng	Right now, I want you to buy me a drink.
3724428	eng	No one's buying anyone a drink.
3724429	eng	You look like someone who could use a drink.
3724430	eng	Tom is at the bar nursing a drink.
3724431	eng	At least let me buy you and your friends a drink.
3724432	eng	I know a place where we can get a drink.
3724433	eng	I should buy you a drink.
3724434	eng	I was hoping you'd let me buy you a drink.
3724435	eng	I should certainly buy you a drink.
3724436	eng	Tom slipped something in Mary's drink.
3724437	eng	Tom refreshed his drink.
3724438	eng	The bartender handed Tom his drink.
3724439	eng	I just want a quiet drink.
3724440	eng	It looks like a slam dunk.
3724441	eng	It's a piece of junk.
3724442	eng	You smell like a drunk.
3724443	eng	These things happen when you're drunk.
3724444	eng	They were drunk.
3724445	eng	I'm so drunk.
3724446	eng	Tom parked his car and opened the trunk.
3724447	eng	Please pop the trunk.
3724448	eng	I can't believe you actually read the book.
3724449	eng	Tom started flipping through the book.
3724450	eng	I'm afraid that violates every rule in the book.
3724451	eng	Tom glanced at the book.
3724452	eng	I played it by the book.
3724453	eng	Tom is an open book.
3724454	eng	Tom is a pretty amazing cook.
3724455	eng	You're off the hook.
3724456	eng	I think your phone's off the hook.
3724457	eng	They exchanged a look.
3724458	eng	I think we should take a look.
3724459	eng	Tom gave Mary a stern look.
3724460	eng	You just had to know where to look.
3724461	eng	Let's take another look.
3724462	eng	Tom couldn't help but look.
3724463	eng	Ha, I made you look.
3724464	eng	Tom gave Mary an icy look.
3724465	eng	That guy happens to be a crook.
3724466	eng	Tom would do whatever it took.
3724467	eng	It isn't fair to keep Tom in the dark.
3724468	eng	Tom speared the shark.
3724469	eng	Tom laughed at the remark.
3724470	eng	I drove around the corner to park.
3724471	eng	Tom is obviously a jerk.
3724472	eng	The crowd went berserk.
3724473	eng	I don't want to look like a dork.
3724474	eng	Stop being such a dork.
3724475	eng	I've never seen such good work.
3724476	eng	It'll be hard work.
3724477	eng	Being a teacher is hard work.
3724478	eng	Being a reporter is hard work.
3724479	eng	You just ruined three years of undercover police work.
3724480	eng	This is how we work.
3724481	eng	That's a dangerous line of work.
3724482	eng	You need to find a new line of work.
3724483	eng	I'll see you as soon as I finish work.
3724484	eng	Twenty to one it'll work.
3724485	eng	I know how hard you all work.
3724486	eng	Tom doesn't think our approach will work.
3724487	eng	I know Tom from work.
3724488	eng	I need to focus on work.
3724489	eng	I'll need someplace to work.
3724490	eng	I refuse to work.
3724491	eng	Let's talk about how this is going to work.
3724492	eng	Tom left the office immediately after work.
3724493	eng	It'd better work.
3724494	eng	Tom told me he was doing some undercover work.
3724495	eng	Tom is dressed for work.
3724496	eng	I'm here looking for work.
3724497	eng	I'm a fan of your work.
3724498	eng	I'm a great admirer of your work.
3724499	eng	I've been following your work.
3724500	eng	Now get on with your work.
3724501	eng	You know how these things work.
3724502	eng	Tom seems to have finished his work.
3724503	eng	Tom settled down to his work.
3724504	eng	You need to make this work.
3724505	eng	I know how you guys work.
3724506	eng	It can't work.
3724507	eng	I just bought this yesterday and it doesn't work.
3724508	eng	Tom has been helping out on weekdays while I'm at work.
3724509	eng	I'm sorry to bother you about this at work.
3724510	eng	Tom has had an accident at work.
3724511	eng	I made it work.
3724512	eng	I need to make it work.
3724513	eng	It's a wonderful idea, but it'll take a lot work.
3724514	eng	We barely talked about work.
3724515	eng	I know how hard you work.
3724516	eng	I'll start the paperwork.
3724517	eng	We've received all the proper paperwork.
3724518	eng	For once in your life, do what I ask.
3724519	eng	I don't have anyone else I can ask.
3724520	eng	I'm afraid to even ask.
3724521	eng	I know it's a lot to ask.
3724522	eng	It's kind of you to ask.
3724523	eng	It was nice of you to ask.
3724524	eng	I don't know whether you can help, but I had to at least ask.
3724525	eng	That's no easy task.
3724526	eng	Put the gun down and move away from the desk.
3724527	eng	Tom drummed on the desk.
3724528	eng	Tom tossed the documents on Mary's desk.
3724529	eng	Tom rose slowly from behind his desk.
3724530	eng	Tom ducked down behind his desk.
3724531	eng	Tom said it was on his desk.
3724532	eng	Tom tapped his fingers on his desk.
3724533	eng	Tom is already at his desk.
3724534	eng	I agree we're taking a risk.
3724535	eng	Tom could be a flight risk.
3724536	eng	Tom isn't a flight risk.
3724537	eng	Tom is certainly not a flight risk.
3724538	eng	Tom is an obvious flight risk.
3724539	eng	I find your arguments illogical.
3724540	eng	It's completely illogical.
3724541	eng	The asking price is astronomical.
3724542	eng	I thought Tom was on sabbatical.
3724543	eng	Timing would be critical.
3724544	eng	Tom's condition is very critical.
3724545	eng	I didn't want to appear hypocritical.
3724546	eng	Tom won the sharpshooter medal.
3724547	eng	It sounds like we've got a deal.
3724548	eng	Tom is trying to cut a deal.
3724549	eng	Tom really got a bad deal.
3724550	eng	Maybe Tom made a good deal.
3724551	eng	Let's do the deal.
3724552	eng	This one's the real deal.
3724553	eng	This is the real deal.
3724554	eng	Tom really got a raw deal.
3724555	eng	You need a good home-cooked meal.
3724556	eng	I had a decent meal.
3724557	eng	I came to fix you a decent meal.
3724558	eng	We want it to look real.
3724559	eng	The pain was real.
3724560	eng	I couldn't tell what was real.
3724561	eng	I didn't even know that was legal.
3724562	eng	I didn't know that was legal.
3724563	eng	It'd be illegal.
3724564	eng	You didn't tell me it was illegal.
3724565	eng	Everything Tom does is illegal.
3724566	eng	I just want it to be special.
3724567	eng	You must be very special.
3724568	eng	It could be beneficial.
3724569	eng	Tom's injuries are superficial.
3724570	eng	I want those responsible for the massacre brought to trial.
3724571	eng	You were an animal.
3724572	eng	I guess everything's back to normal.
3724573	eng	I've always had an interest in the paranormal.
3724574	eng	Tom is completely delusional.
3724575	eng	Tom just told me something personal.
3724576	eng	I didn't mean to get too personal.
3724577	eng	You're making this personal.
3724578	eng	You don't have to get personal.
3724579	eng	Tom isn't exactly a liberal.
3724580	eng	Tom is a decorated general.
3724581	eng	I've decided to accept your proposal.
3724582	eng	I had to consider Tom's proposal.
3724583	eng	You need a lot more capital.
3724584	eng	I wound up in the hospital.
3724585	eng	Most of Tom's friends know that he's in the hospital.
3724586	eng	Tom got out of the car and ran into the hospital.
3724587	eng	Tom was sent to a mental hospital.
3724588	eng	None of us are immortal.
3724589	eng	I hear the competition is brutal.
3724590	eng	You seem to be enjoying that more than usual.
3724591	eng	The feeling was mutual.
3724592	eng	Tom was pronounced dead on arrival.
3724593	eng	You don't need Tom's money or his approval.
3724594	eng	I want to be a role model.
3724595	eng	That's how I feel.
3724596	eng	It's time you knew how I feel.
3724597	eng	I don't know how I feel.
3724598	eng	That's the way I feel.
3724599	eng	I don't like the way it makes me feel.
3724600	eng	I can feel everything you feel.
3724601	eng	Tom got out of the car, but Mary remained behind the wheel.
3724602	eng	Take the wheel.
3724603	eng	Let me take the wheel.
3724604	eng	Tom sat down behind the steering wheel.
3724605	eng	Tom peered down the tunnel.
3724606	eng	This is like shooting fish in a barrel.
3724607	eng	A bus pulled up in front of the hotel.
3724608	eng	I'm not going to fight a duel.
3724609	eng	I've already posted your bail.
3724610	eng	I'm not going to spend the rest of my life in jail.
3724611	eng	You'll die in jail.
3724612	eng	If you keep doing what you're doing, you'll end up in jail.
3724613	eng	Tom will end up in jail.
3724614	eng	I'll visit you in jail.
3724615	eng	Let it go to voicemail.
3724616	eng	I'll take this trail.
3724617	eng	Don't leave out a single detail.
3724618	eng	Tom is a tricky little devil.
3724619	eng	I want to be a daredevil.
3724620	eng	Tom wasn't late after all.
3724621	eng	I just want to get my daughter back safely, that's all.
3724622	eng	That's not good at all.
3724623	eng	Tom never got into any trouble at all.
3724624	eng	I'm sorry I told them anything at all.
3724625	eng	Tom has no manners at all.
3724626	eng	I don't like the sound of that at all.
3724627	eng	We won't be talking about that at all.
3724628	eng	I never heard Tom say anything to Mary at all.
3724629	eng	Tom remembered it all.
3724630	eng	It's a pleasure to meet you all.
3724631	eng	I can make a call.
3724632	eng	I need you to make a phone call.
3724633	eng	You get one phone call.
3724634	eng	This isn't a social call.
3724635	eng	This is your wake-up call.
3724636	eng	That's Tom's call.
3724637	eng	I don't think that's the right call.
3724638	eng	Tom made a bad judgment call.
3724639	eng	Tom continued walking down the hall.
3724640	eng	I don't remember Tom being so tall.
3724641	eng	Hey, get away from the wall.
3724642	eng	Tom stuck a poster on the wall.
3724643	eng	Tom smashed a champagne glass against the wall.
3724644	eng	Tom looked through the small window in the door to see who had rung the doorbell.
3724645	eng	Tom is in a holding cell.
3724646	eng	You're mad at me, I can tell.
3724647	eng	It's really hard to tell.
3724648	eng	I don't have any more jokes to tell.
3724649	eng	I don't have any more jokes left to tell.
3724650	eng	It was a job done well.
3724651	eng	Tom remembered Mary quite well.
3724652	eng	This isn't going well.
3724653	eng	The meeting seemed to go well.
3724654	eng	That seemed to go well.
3724655	eng	Tom knows this isn't going to go well.
3724656	eng	Tom could dance rather well.
3724657	eng	I taught you well.
3724658	eng	It went extremely well.
3724659	eng	Tom isn't looking very well.
3724660	eng	Most of Tom's friends know that he doesn't speak French very well.
3724661	eng	I guess you know me pretty well.
3724662	eng	I do pretty well.
3724663	eng	I hear they pay pretty well.
3724664	eng	Tom held out his cup for a refill.
3724665	eng	That's a buzz kill.
3724666	eng	Tom ran on the treadmill.
3724667	eng	Our taxi pulled up outside a place called Chuck's Bar and Grill.
3724668	eng	You'll need to hold still.
3724669	eng	Tom lay perfectly still.
3724670	eng	If I don't report it, someone else will.
3724671	eng	I just want to do God's will.
3724672	eng	Tom left you everything he had in his will.
3724673	eng	Do with it what you will.
3724674	eng	We're ready to roll.
3724675	eng	Tom put me on the payroll.
3724676	eng	It was half full.
3724677	eng	Tom tried to play it cool.
3724678	eng	It sounds really cool.
3724679	eng	That seems pretty cool.
3724680	eng	Tom made you look like a fool.
3724681	eng	Don't play me for a fool.
3724682	eng	Tom is playing you for a fool.
3724683	eng	I think we should send Tom to a private school.
3724684	eng	Tom was horrible to me in high school.
3724685	eng	I used to beat Tom up in high school.
3724686	eng	I was the student body president in high school.
3724687	eng	Some kids cut through my yard on their way to school.
3724688	eng	Tom disappeared after school.
3724689	eng	You said I should work harder at school.
3724690	eng	We're about to go out on patrol.
3724691	eng	Tom does seem to be in control.
3724692	eng	I finally feel like everything's under control.
3724693	eng	I think we got it under control.
3724694	eng	Can you imagine a blue Ferrari?
3724695	epo	Mi venis por manĝigi la fiŝojn de Tomo.

3724704	eng	I'm buying my watch in that shop there.
3724705	eng	Gate closes 20 minutes before departure.
3724706	eng	Tom was embarrassed when he took his shirt off in front of Mary for the first time, because he had his ex's name tatooed on his chest.
3724707	eng	Give me a minute to think about it.
3724708	nah	Ma Dios Espirito Santo motlantzinco yez cemicac.

3724719	eng	We're all capable of exercising self-control.
3724720	eng	Tom showed me a picture of his mother as a schoolgirl.
3724721	eng	Give it a whirl.
3724722	eng	It's disgraceful.
3724723	eng	We have many reasons to be hopeful.
3724724	eng	I was hoping for something a little more useful.
3724725	eng	I'm so grateful.
3724726	eng	Tom was grateful.
3724727	eng	They were ungrateful.
3724728	eng	I don't want to appear ungrateful.
3724729	eng	They are so beautiful.
3724730	eng	I don't think I've ever seen anything so beautiful.
3724731	eng	God, you're beautiful.
3724732	eng	Black is beautiful.
3724733	eng	It's astonishingly beautiful.
3724734	eng	That would be less painful.
3724735	eng	I was hoping for something a little more helpful.
3724736	eng	You've been most helpful.
3724737	eng	Tom was quite successful.
3724738	eng	That was very hurtful.
3724739	eng	I've decided to stay where I am.
3724740	eng	No one is more determined than I am.
3724741	eng	You're even dumber than I am.
3724742	eng	I'm not going to change who I am.
3724743	eng	I just wish I could remember who I am.
3724744	eng	I don't seem to remember who I am.
3724745	eng	It's just the way I am.
3724746	eng	I don't know how to say how sorry I really am.
3724747	eng	It's a pleasure to meet you, ma'am.
3724748	eng	It sounds like a scam.
3724749	eng	That sounds like a scam.
3724750	eng	You two will work as a team.
3724751	eng	Take one for the team.
3724752	eng	You're part of our team.
3724753	eng	I heard that you bought a hockey team.
3724754	eng	I needed to blow off some steam.
3724755	eng	This might all be a sham.
3724756	eng	This might be all a sham.
3724757	eng	Their marriage is a sham.
3724758	eng	I don't need a cardiogram.
3724759	eng	We're particularly interested in your music program.
3724760	eng	I'm not what I seem.
3724761	eng	I know how hopeless things can seem.
3724762	eng	I have very low self-esteem.
3724763	eng	You must have dropped them.
3724764	eng	Someone must have planted them.
3724765	eng	Tom believed them.
3724766	eng	That's why I like them.
3724767	eng	They want everything right now that you said you'd give them.
3724768	eng	Don't take any notice of them.
3724769	eng	Tom was one of them.
3724770	eng	Tom is the only one capable of stopping them.
3724771	eng	We're not at war with them.
3724772	eng	We're cuter than them.
3724773	eng	I don't want to get too close to them.
3724774	eng	They didn't know what was happening to them.
3724775	eng	Tom and Mary were thrilled to bits when their daughter took her first steps.
3724776	eng	Hang on to them.
3724777	eng	Tom and Mary were speaking loud enough for John to hear them.
3724778	eng	Tom and Mary were speaking loud enough for John to overhear them.
3724779	eng	We buy the cattle and slaughter them.
3724780	eng	Tom glared at them.
3724781	eng	I've learned to trust them.
3724782	eng	I was told you had some news about them.
3724783	eng	You're better off without them.
3724784	eng	I felt threatened by them.
3724785	eng	If we don't have a solution, the least we can do is acknowledge that there's a problem.
3724786	eng	I'm not sure I see that as a problem.
3724787	eng	Tom clearly has a problem.
3724788	eng	I don't find it a problem.
3724789	eng	It wasn't a maintenance problem.
3724790	eng	I think you're overstating the problem.
3724791	eng	I assume this is the problem.
3724792	eng	Tom was stumped by the problem.
3724793	eng	I'm really starting to worry that you've got a hearing problem.
3724794	eng	There is an additional problem.
3724795	eng	If they lied about that, we've got a much bigger problem.
3724796	eng	There's a logical answer to every problem.
3724797	eng	You're a victim of the system.
3724798	eng	You've got rhythm.
3724799	eng	Tom was there for me when I really needed him.
3724800	eng	Tom started to say something, but Mary shushed him.
3724801	eng	We think you can tell us where to find him.
3724802	eng	Tom had his hands cuffed behind him.
3724803	eng	Tom stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.
3724804	eng	I'm sure I've never heard of him.
3724805	eng	Tom's curiosity got the better of him.
3724806	eng	Tom has got his whole life in front of him.
3724807	eng	Nobody remembers seeing him.
3724808	eng	Tell Tom not to hate me for leaving him.
3724809	eng	Tom has something we want, so we need to find something he wants that we can trade with him.
3724810	eng	Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
3724811	eng	I want Tom to know I've got no beef with him.
3724812	eng	Tom wants to know what to do with all the stuff you left with him.
3724813	eng	Find Tom and kill him.
3724814	eng	Tom had plenty of fight left in him.
3724815	eng	Tom motioned for Mary to join him.
3724816	eng	I can sell it to him.
3724817	eng	Tom knows there's only one choice for him.
3724818	eng	I find it difficult to tell Tom I miss him.
3724819	eng	Tom was a good friend, and I'll miss him.
3724820	eng	You'll know him when you meet him.
3724821	eng	Tom took to drinking after his wife left him.
3724822	eng	Tom probably never knew what hit him.
3724823	eng	If Tom doesn't surrender, shoot him.
3724824	eng	I knew there was something familiar about him.
3724825	eng	Tom said I wasn't to worry about him.
3724826	eng	Tom ran as fast as his legs could carry him.
3724827	eng	Tom was the third victim.
3724828	eng	Tom loves to play the victim.
3724829	eng	There's just no way to get Tom to swim.
3724830	eng	I must be calm.
3724831	eng	I just need to stay calm.
3724832	eng	We're not here to talk about music, Tom.
3724833	eng	It's not authentic, Tom.
3724834	eng	This one's got me worried, Tom.
3724835	eng	Tell me you understand, Tom.
3724836	eng	I can be your friend, Tom.
3724837	eng	I'm not the one looking for a girlfriend, Tom.
3724838	eng	Leave it be, Tom.
3724839	eng	Get out of my face, Tom.
3724840	eng	This isn't your kind of place, Tom.
3724841	eng	It wasn't your choice, Tom.
3724842	eng	You never had a chance, Tom.
3724843	eng	This is your one chance, Tom.
3724844	eng	We're on the same side, Tom.
3724845	eng	You've lived a charmed life, Tom.
3724846	eng	You saved my marriage, Tom.
3724847	eng	You have me at a disadvantage, Tom.
3724848	eng	Don't ride the brake, Tom.
3724849	eng	I hope you find our quarters comfortable, Tom.
3724850	eng	Girls aren't worth the trouble, Tom.
3724851	eng	We're not bad people, Tom.
3724852	eng	Don't make a liar out of me, Tom.
3724853	eng	You can't control me, Tom.
3724854	eng	Come out and talk to me, Tom.
3724855	eng	You can't protect everybody all the time, Tom.
3724856	eng	I'm only going to ask you this one time, Tom.
3724857	eng	You're the one who wanted me to come, Tom.
3724858	eng	This isn't your home, Tom.
3724859	eng	You're a strange one, Tom.
3724860	eng	I'm putting my foot down on this one, Tom.
3724861	eng	I owe you one, Tom.
3724862	eng	This may not go as smoothly as you hope, Tom.
3724863	eng	You're on pretty shaky ground here, Tom.
3724864	eng	That's not why I called you in here, Tom.
3724865	eng	You have a very impressive operation here, Tom.
3724866	eng	You've done remarkable things here, Tom.
3724867	eng	You're missing my point here, Tom.
3724868	eng	Help me out here, Tom.
3724869	eng	You've lost me there, Tom.
3724870	eng	You sure have a way with words there, Tom.
3724871	eng	This way please, Tom.
3724872	eng	Get off your high horse, Tom.
3724873	eng	You're digging your own grave, Tom.
3724874	eng	You might want to reconsider that move, Tom.
3724875	eng	I've come to say goodbye, Tom.
3724876	eng	They'll promise you anything, Tom.
3724877	eng	That's good thinking, Tom.
3724878	eng	Stop sniveling, Tom.
3724879	eng	You should be smiling, Tom.
3724880	eng	I'm ready and willing, Tom.
3724881	eng	That's very amusing, Tom.
3724882	eng	Thanks so much for coming here to help me with my speech, Tom.
3724883	eng	I don't think that matters much, Tom.
3724884	eng	You've still got the touch, Tom.
3724885	eng	You'll need your strength, Tom.
3724886	eng	Don't make me shoot you in the back, Tom.
3724887	eng	Dial it back, Tom.
3724888	eng	You're in this up to your neck, Tom.
3724889	eng	You're going to have your hands full, Tom.
3724890	eng	Get with the program, Tom.
3724891	eng	We'll have to check every one of them, Tom.
3724892	eng	You're holding too much in, Tom.
3724893	eng	Don't rub it in, Tom.
3724894	eng	It sounds like you're home free again, Tom.
3724895	eng	We'll be together again, Tom.
3724896	eng	I don't want to lose you again, Tom.
3724897	eng	This is one you can't win, Tom.
3724898	eng	Get your clothes on, Tom.
3724899	eng	Don't run yourself down, Tom.
3724900	eng	Dial it down, Tom.
3724901	eng	Tell me you remember, Tom.
3724902	eng	Well, you certainly have a lot to offer, Tom.
3724903	eng	Listen to your father, Tom.
3724904	eng	Don't sass your father, Tom.
3724905	eng	You really are a smooth talker, Tom.
3724906	eng	Don't be a party pooper, Tom.
3724907	eng	You have a lot to answer for, Tom.
3724908	eng	You're impossible to find a gift for, Tom.
3724909	eng	I admire your scruples, Tom.
3724910	eng	We've been down this road too many times, Tom.
3724911	eng	Stay on your toes, Tom.
3724912	eng	I just tell it like it is, Tom.
3724913	eng	We'll figure out another way out of this, Tom.
3724914	eng	I don't see where you're going with this, Tom.
3724915	eng	You know you don't have to do this, Tom.
3724916	eng	I'm going to get you for this, Tom.
3724917	eng	You haven't been returning my calls, Tom.
3724918	eng	You taught me always to face my fears, Tom.
3724919	eng	You've been in a coma for three years, Tom.
3724920	eng	You have your orders, Tom.
3724921	eng	Give me the other set of keys, Tom.
3724922	eng	You look like you're doing just great, Tom.
3724923	eng	You already know the answer to that, Tom.
3724924	eng	You're holding me too tight, Tom.
3724925	eng	Fake it till you make it, Tom.
3724926	eng	Everybody down here sure likes you a lot, Tom.
3724927	eng	You're all heart, Tom.
3724928	eng	We meet at last, Tom.
3724929	eng	That's what we're trying to figure out, Tom.
3724930	eng	Knock yourself out, Tom.
3724931	eng	I don't see why you're freaking out, Tom.
3724932	eng	That's what I love about you, Tom.
3724933	eng	I can see right through you, Tom.
3724934	eng	God be with you, Tom.
3724935	eng	I have every confidence in you, Tom.
3724936	eng	Nobody's going to do anything to you, Tom.
3724937	eng	Don't let it get to you, Tom.
3724938	eng	Don't make me come after you, Tom.
3724939	eng	God has a plan for you, Tom.
3724940	eng	We've been looking all over for you, Tom.
3724941	eng	I've got real bad news for you, Tom.
3724942	eng	I have good news for you, Tom.
3724943	eng	I'm very concerned about you, Tom.
3724944	eng	I've always cared about you, Tom.
3724945	eng	Everyone was right about you, Tom.
3724946	eng	Get over here right now, Tom.
3724947	eng	We don't have all day, Tom.
3724948	eng	You don't want to mess with me today, Tom.
3724949	eng	I don't care what you say, Tom.
3724950	eng	Have it your own way, Tom.
3724951	eng	It doesn't have to be this way, Tom.
3724952	eng	It doesn't work that way, Tom.
3724953	eng	You've done admirably, Tom.
3724954	eng	You handled that badly, Tom.
3724955	eng	You're not getting away from me that easily, Tom.
3724956	eng	We can tell you're not a bad guy, Tom.
3724957	eng	I knew I should've married Tom.
3724958	eng	The girls all liked Tom.
3724959	eng	You're the guy who killed Tom.
3724960	eng	I assume this is what killed Tom.
3724961	eng	That's the person they suspect killed Tom.
3724962	eng	Tell us why you killed Tom.
3724963	eng	The person in charge was named Tom.
3724964	eng	All I can tell you is it had something to do with a guy named Tom.
3724965	eng	How do I know you haven't already harmed Tom?
3724966	eng	We should not have angered Tom.
3724967	eng	You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
3724968	eng	I just know I wouldn't have missed Tom.
3724969	eng	I can see why you suspected Tom.
3724970	eng	It makes me wonder how much you really loved Tom.
3724971	eng	Somebody might've followed Tom.
3724972	eng	The police have no grounds to hold Tom.
3724973	eng	This is between me and Tom.
3724974	eng	I can't walk out on you and Tom.
3724975	eng	I don't know how you can stand Tom.
3724976	eng	I highly recommend Tom.
3724977	eng	We must all go and find Tom.
3724978	eng	It's important that we find Tom.
3724979	eng	It's important we find Tom.
3724980	eng	I want to know what you're doing to find Tom.
3724981	eng	We'll do everything in our power to find Tom.
3724982	eng	I think I know how to find Tom.
3724983	eng	We've looked everywhere and can't find Tom.
3724984	eng	I have no idea where you might find Tom.
3724985	eng	It's only a matter of time before they find Tom.
3724986	eng	All of a sudden, the door slammed behind Tom.
3724987	eng	Show us where you found Tom.
3724988	eng	Never let your guard down around Tom.
3724989	eng	That better not be Tom.
3724990	eng	I haven't been able to face Tom.
3724991	eng	People are beginning to notice Tom.
3724992	eng	I don't need to convince Tom.
3724993	eng	I'll do everything in my power to convince Tom.
3724994	eng	It's urgent that I see Tom.
3724995	eng	I was there that day because I needed to see Tom.
3724996	eng	I understand you were the last one to see Tom.
3724997	eng	You were the last person to see Tom.
3724998	eng	You may have been the last person to see Tom.
3724999	eng	I can't tell you how good it is to see Tom.
3725000	eng	It's not like I'm real anxious to see Tom.
3725001	eng	That's why I like Tom.
3725002	eng	Don't try to reason with people like Tom.
3725003	eng	I didn't much like Tom.
3725004	eng	I wish I knew where we could find others like Tom.
3725005	eng	I wish I knew where we could find other workers like Tom.
3725006	eng	This isn't like Tom.
3725007	eng	You sounded just like Tom.
3725008	eng	It sounds exactly like Tom.
3725009	eng	I thought you could handle Tom.
3725010	eng	I'll make everyone call me Tom.
3725011	eng	You should know that my friends call me Tom.
3725012	eng	You've certainly outdone Tom.
3725013	eng	I know exactly what I'd want to do if I were Tom.
3725014	eng	Let somebody else hire Tom.
3725015	eng	I'm afraid you're going to have to release Tom.
3725016	eng	The truth is I bent over backwards to accommodate Tom.
3725017	eng	The DNA here doesn't exonerate Tom.
3725018	eng	You must help me save Tom.
3725019	eng	You're the only one who can save Tom.
3725020	eng	I think it's about time we started to believe Tom.
3725021	eng	That's how I know you love Tom.
3725022	eng	Get your filthy hands off Tom.
3725023	eng	If it means that much to you, I'll get rid of Tom.
3725024	eng	You've ruined the best chance we had to get rid of Tom.
3725025	eng	I don't have any way of getting hold of Tom.
3725026	eng	Let's just see if I can get hold of Tom.
3725027	eng	Don't grow too fond of Tom.
3725028	eng	I've grown rather fond of Tom.
3725029	eng	I've heard of Tom.
3725030	eng	I think you might've been proud of Tom.
3725031	eng	I'm not going to take advantage of Tom.
3725032	eng	I can't figure out what to make of Tom.
3725033	eng	Get your hands off of Tom.
3725034	eng	Get off of Tom.
3725035	eng	I made your father promise never to speak of Tom.
3725036	eng	I've lost track of Tom.
3725037	eng	It's important to me what you think of Tom.
3725038	eng	That was very thoughtful of Tom.
3725039	eng	There's still no sign of Tom.
3725040	eng	The bartender set a drink in front of Tom.
3725041	eng	The waiter set a coffee cup in front of Tom.
3725042	eng	Anything you have to say, you can say in front of Tom.
3725043	eng	I'm not sure how much you'll get out of Tom.
3725044	eng	That's all I can get out of Tom.
3725045	eng	That was the last I saw of Tom.
3725046	eng	That's the last we saw of Tom.
3725047	eng	That was the last we saw of Tom.
3725048	eng	That's the last anybody saw of Tom.
3725049	eng	There was no avoiding Tom.
3725050	eng	The longer we wait, the less chance we have of finding Tom.
3725051	eng	I've been seeing Tom.
3725052	eng	Thank you for bringing Tom.
3725053	eng	What do you think they're telling Tom?
3725054	eng	Please help me in welcoming Tom.
3725055	eng	There was no escaping Tom.
3725056	eng	I can't imagine what could be keeping Tom.
3725057	eng	I'll see what's keeping Tom.
3725058	eng	There's no stopping Tom.
3725059	eng	There was no stopping Tom.
3725060	eng	I guess I was afraid I was losing Tom.
3725061	eng	I've actually never had the pleasure of meeting Tom.
3725062	eng	I'm not the one hurting Tom.
3725063	eng	I could see you marrying Tom.
3725064	eng	I'm not sure you'll be able to reach Tom.
3725065	eng	I can't seem to reach Tom.
3725066	eng	With your help, we'll catch Tom.
3725067	eng	I think we can catch Tom.
3725068	eng	The judge raised his hand to shush Tom.
3725069	eng	You did a great job with Tom.
3725070	eng	We really shouldn't have carpooled with Tom.
3725071	eng	Wow, you're really obsessed with Tom.
3725072	eng	Consider yourself lucky that you were never involved with Tom.
3725073	eng	I'm still proud to have served with Tom.
3725074	eng	Maybe I could have a word with Tom.
3725075	eng	I don't know why I even thought I had a chance with Tom.
3725076	eng	I'm starting to lose patience with Tom.
3725077	eng	I have an old score to settle with Tom.
3725078	eng	You're the one spending the most time with Tom.
3725079	eng	I thought you said you were done with Tom.
3725080	eng	I don't think I'll be able to get in there with Tom.
3725081	eng	I don't seem to be getting anywhere with Tom.
3725082	eng	I'm not asking you to go on a date with Tom.
3725083	eng	Maybe I'm in love with Tom.
3725084	eng	I saw you having coffee this morning with Tom.
3725085	eng	I must strongly caution you against going with Tom.
3725086	eng	It's their job to figure out what's wrong with Tom.
3725087	eng	The doctors can't even say what's wrong with Tom.
3725088	eng	As far as I can tell, there's nothing medically wrong with Tom.
3725089	eng	I'm through with Tom.
3725090	eng	Thank you for letting me speak with Tom.
3725091	eng	If you wish, I can arrange for you to speak with Tom.
3725092	eng	I'll make arrangements for you to speak with Tom.
3725093	eng	It's clear that you didn't speak with Tom.
3725094	eng	I think I'll ride back with Tom.
3725095	eng	I had a talk with Tom.
3725096	eng	It's time to level with Tom.
3725097	eng	Things weren't going well with Tom.
3725098	eng	The others are in the conference room with Tom.
3725099	eng	I'm moving in with Tom.
3725100	eng	I'm going to go check in with Tom.
3725101	eng	I've been thinking about my conversation with Tom.
3725102	eng	Maybe I can reason with Tom.
3725103	eng	It occurred to me it might have something to do with Tom.
3725104	eng	I think it has something to do with Tom.
3725105	eng	They're not sure what to do with Tom.
3725106	eng	Don't do anything foolhardy like deciding to go with Tom.
3725107	eng	I'm not sure my parents know about my relationship with Tom.
3725108	eng	I never advised you to break up with Tom.
3725109	eng	I'll take it up with Tom.
3725110	eng	Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Tom.
3725111	eng	I'm going to fix you up with Tom.
3725112	eng	I wanted to discuss that matter with Tom.
3725113	eng	I have dinner plans with Tom.
3725114	eng	We've had lengthy discussions with Tom.
3725115	eng	I made the mistake of trying to start a business with Tom.
3725116	eng	I made the mistake of going into business with Tom.
3725117	eng	I have to have a little chat with Tom.
3725118	eng	You're to have no further contact with Tom.
3725119	nah	Auh ōhuālmocuepqueh tlanāhuatico cah mochi in tlālli ahmō acah quipiyaya, īcēl toca ōquitztiahqueh in tetepanzoltzin calchīhualli catca.
3725120	eng	Have you got any idea what I'm talking about?
3725121	eng	I know in my gut that something's not right with Tom.
3725122	eng	I can only discuss it with Tom.
3725123	eng	This whole subject is clearly a sore spot with Tom.
3725124	eng	Well, you have to be honest with Tom.
3725125	eng	I thought you had more sense than to go out with Tom.
3725126	eng	You never know with Tom.
3725127	eng	It would be very normal for you to be angry with Tom.
3725128	eng	Clearly, you're angry with Tom.
3725129	eng	There was another guy with Tom.
3725130	eng	You'll spook Tom.
3725131	eng	I'm just here to find out who took Tom.
3725132	eng	I know who took Tom.
3725133	eng	I already said I don't know who took Tom.
3725134	eng	You'd have to ask Tom.
3725135	eng	You would have to ask Tom.
3725136	eng	I guess that's why I didn't ask Tom.
3725137	eng	Let me in or I'll tell Tom.
3725138	eng	I have so many things I want to tell Tom.
3725139	eng	It wouldn't hurt to tell Tom.
3725140	eng	There's one thing I must tell Tom.
3725141	eng	I'll let you tell Tom.
3725142	eng	There was no need for you to kill Tom.
3725143	eng	That's the last I heard from Tom.
3725144	eng	I've got an important message from Tom.
3725145	eng	We still have so much to learn from Tom.
3725146	eng	I glad that you took that gun away from Tom.
3725147	eng	You have no right to take it away from Tom.
3725148	eng	You said the message came directly from Tom.
3725149	eng	You look worse than Tom.
3725150	eng	You could do a lot worse than Tom.
3725151	eng	That'd make you crazier than Tom.
3725152	eng	To my knowledge, I've never seen Tom.
3725153	eng	I swear all I meant to do was to threaten Tom.
3725154	eng	I don't understand what you see in Tom.
3725155	eng	They're trying to restrain Tom.
3725156	eng	They must've relied on Tom.
3725157	eng	Don't even get me started on Tom.
3725158	eng	I never laid a hand on Tom.
3725159	eng	I'm saying I never laid a hand on Tom.
3725160	eng	This has been really hard on Tom.
3725161	eng	Don't waste your breath on Tom.
3725162	eng	Maybe I should check on Tom.
3725163	eng	I think I should check on Tom.
3725164	eng	The police are closing in on Tom.
3725165	eng	You really made an impression on Tom.
3725166	eng	You certainly made an impression on Tom.
3725167	eng	The truth began to dawn on Tom.
3725168	eng	I didn't sneak up on Tom.
3725169	eng	Maybe you should go check up on Tom.
3725170	eng	I want to put a private investigator on Tom.
3725171	eng	Just give me a chance get my hands on Tom.
3725172	eng	Show me everything you've got on Tom.
3725173	eng	That'll depend entirely on Tom.
3725174	eng	I guess I could go easy on Tom.
3725175	eng	You were always too easy on Tom.
3725176	eng	There have been many attempts to poison Tom.
3725177	eng	This must've belonged to Tom.
3725178	eng	You're the worst thing that ever happened to Tom.
3725179	eng	I regret what happened to Tom.
3725180	eng	We both know what happened to Tom.
3725181	eng	I thought you said you weren't attracted to Tom.
3725182	eng	I owe my life to Tom.
3725183	eng	You've got to let me get a message to Tom.
3725184	eng	I know you were close to Tom.
3725185	eng	It made me feel close to Tom.
3725186	eng	That's the last gift you are allowed to give to Tom.
3725187	eng	I wasn't able to say goodbye to Tom.
3725188	eng	I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
3725189	eng	You've got to apologize to Tom.
3725190	eng	You have to stop clinging to Tom.
3725191	eng	I don't want to do anything to Tom.
3725192	eng	I wasn't finished talking to Tom.
3725193	eng	Today we'll be talking to Tom.
3725194	eng	You weren't even listening to Tom.
3725195	eng	We haven't been able to get through to Tom.
3725196	eng	I tried my best to get through to Tom.
3725197	eng	I wrote back to Tom.
3725198	eng	I'm not going to do anything until I talk to Tom.
3725199	eng	It would help if we could talk to Tom.
3725200	eng	If you won't talk to me, I'll talk to Tom.
3725201	eng	Well, I'm just going to talk to Tom.
3725202	eng	All I want is to talk to Tom.
3725203	eng	I just thought that you might want to talk to Tom.
3725204	eng	All you had to do was talk to Tom.
3725205	eng	Mary looked beautiful to Tom.
3725206	eng	They're not going to let anything happen to Tom.
3725207	eng	If I were you, I'd listen to Tom.
3725208	eng	I stopped paying attention to Tom.
3725209	eng	We aren't being much help to Tom.
3725210	eng	I had to find a way to make it up to Tom.
3725211	eng	It wouldn't be fair to Tom.
3725212	eng	Please extend my apologies to Tom.
3725213	eng	We've got to find out who did this to Tom.
3725214	eng	Make sure nothing happens to Tom.
3725215	eng	I've already mentioned that to Tom.
3725216	eng	Try explaining that to Tom.
3725217	eng	I heard you paid a visit to Tom.
3725218	eng	I know how much you meant to Tom.
3725219	eng	Nothing else is important to Tom.
3725220	eng	So let's find out what is important to Tom.
3725221	eng	It's very important to Tom.
3725222	eng	I'm sure that would mean a lot to Tom.
3725223	eng	If you'll wait a moment, I'll take you to Tom.
3725224	eng	I'm recommending you to Tom.
3725225	eng	Maybe that wasn't the best thing to say to Tom.
3725226	eng	I don't even know what to say to Tom.
3725227	eng	I don't know what's gotten into Tom.
3725228	eng	I don't know what got into Tom.
3725229	eng	We're ready to do our best in order to help Tom.
3725230	eng	I don't think that's going to stop Tom.
3725231	eng	We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
3725232	eng	There's got to be some way to stop Tom.
3725233	eng	I didn't try to stop Tom.
3725234	eng	This isn't the way I wanted to remember Tom.
3725235	eng	I thought you were supposed to be looking after Tom.
3725236	eng	We don't have time to go chasing after Tom.
3725237	eng	I already explained to you that I was over Tom.
3725238	eng	Don't make a fuss over Tom.
3725239	eng	I need to get over Tom.
3725240	eng	This is extremely hard for Tom.
3725241	eng	I would've done the same for Tom.
3725242	eng	This has been a very troubling time for Tom.
3725243	eng	I didn't come here for Tom.
3725244	eng	I've developed a bit of a thing for Tom.
3725245	eng	Keep looking for Tom.
3725246	eng	Someone just came in asking for Tom.
3725247	eng	This is getting to be too much for Tom.
3725248	eng	Nothing's good enough for Tom.
3725249	spa	Y volvieron con la noticia de que en toda la tierra no había más que edificios caídos y paredes derrumbadas de casas.
3725250	eng	That's good enough for Tom.
3725251	eng	It's just big enough for Tom.
3725252	eng	I won't cook for Tom.
3725253	eng	This is an incredibly hard decision for Tom.
3725254	eng	This was clearly a difficult decision for Tom.
3725255	eng	It's the least I can do for Tom.
3725256	eng	I'm predicting big things for Tom.
3725257	eng	Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
3725258	eng	Clearly, you have feelings for Tom.
3725259	eng	I understand you went to bat for Tom.
3725260	eng	It's been a hard night for Tom.
3725261	eng	I wasn't expecting you to do it for Tom.
3725262	eng	This is obviously a sore point for Tom.
3725263	eng	It doesn't have to be that way for Tom.
3725264	eng	I know that you cared deeply for Tom.
3725265	eng	It's not going to be easy for Tom.
3725266	eng	It hasn't been easy for Tom.
3725267	eng	It's a pity we're not all as reliable as Tom.
3725268	eng	It seems your only friend was Tom.
3725269	eng	I've seen what happens to anyone who opposes Tom.
3725270	eng	The person we need to tell now is Tom.
3725271	eng	That's what everybody calls Tom.
3725272	eng	This directly concerns Tom.
3725273	eng	You're just afraid you'll have to kiss Tom.
3725274	eng	I don't think anyone suspected you weren't Tom.
3725275	eng	People stopped and stared at Tom.
3725276	eng	Everyone is still staring at Tom.
3725277	eng	The guards are aiming their weapons at Tom.
3725278	eng	Somebody took a shot at Tom.
3725279	eng	I've seen how well you treat Tom.
3725280	eng	You have no reason to doubt Tom.
3725281	eng	This doesn't seem to affect Tom.
3725282	eng	You've got to respect Tom.
3725283	eng	They're here to protect Tom.
3725284	eng	I think I want to meet Tom.
3725285	eng	We're about to meet Tom.
3725286	eng	Well, I didn't exactly meet Tom.
3725287	eng	We'd better go in there and get Tom.
3725288	eng	You just want to get Tom.
3725289	eng	In a way, I'm glad I never met Tom.
3725290	eng	I didn't plan to hit Tom.
3725291	eng	You were the one who suggested I visit Tom.
3725292	eng	You should consult Tom.
3725293	eng	It's not my job to confront Tom.
3725294	eng	Someone has to confront Tom.
3725295	eng	The guards are going to shoot Tom.
3725296	eng	I can't believe we were going to shoot Tom.
3725297	eng	Everyone is seated at the table except Tom.
3725298	eng	It breaks my heart that I can't comfort Tom.
3725299	eng	It's our duty to support Tom.
3725300	eng	Maybe I hurt Tom.
3725301	eng	This is going to hurt Tom.
3725302	eng	There are those who wish to hurt Tom.
3725303	eng	I'm not the one that wants to hurt Tom.
3725304	eng	I swear I never hurt Tom.
3725305	eng	I still don't think we've seen the last Tom.
3725306	eng	The last thing in the world I want to do is arrest Tom.
3725307	eng	There's no concrete evidence against Tom.
3725308	eng	The tide is turning against Tom.
3725309	eng	I've seen what happens to anyone who goes up against Tom.
3725310	eng	We can file charges against Tom.
3725311	eng	I wouldn't bet against Tom.
3725312	eng	You can't force me to testify against Tom.
3725313	eng	It couldn't be anyone else but Tom.
3725314	eng	I don't think it's fair to single out Tom.
3725315	eng	I know you've always cared about Tom.
3725316	eng	It's a pity you didn't know more about Tom.
3725317	eng	I can't remember anything else about Tom.
3725318	eng	That's the most irritating thing about Tom.
3725319	eng	We simply don't know anything about Tom.
3725320	eng	We're done talking about Tom.
3725321	eng	I was so wrong about Tom.
3725322	eng	It seems I was wrong about Tom.
3725323	eng	I'm still not sure how I feel about Tom.
3725324	eng	I have some information about Tom.
3725325	eng	Look, what we have to worry about is what we're going to do about Tom.
3725326	eng	There's something oddly familiar about Tom.
3725327	eng	There's something awfully familiar about Tom.
3725328	eng	We've all said nice things about Tom.
3725329	eng	They were asking questions about Tom.
3725330	eng	I'm not upset about Tom.
3725331	eng	I have a theory about Tom.
3725332	eng	I thought you were crazy about Tom.
3725333	eng	The neighborhood won't be the same without Tom.
3725334	eng	It's going to be hard to live without Tom.
3725335	eng	They're not going to make a move without Tom.
3725336	eng	I think you're better off without Tom.
3725337	eng	School isn't going to be as much fun without Tom.
3725338	eng	It's going to be quiet without Tom.
3725339	eng	This place would fall apart without Tom.
3725340	eng	Do your best without Tom.
3725341	eng	There were times I would've been lost without Tom.
3725342	eng	Life would be empty without Tom.
3725343	eng	You didn't see this one coming, did you, Tom?
3725344	eng	I have faith in you, Tom.
3725345	eng	We were driving down the road when we saw Tom.
3725346	eng	I'm not sure I want to get to know Tom.
3725347	eng	I'll run it by Tom.
3725348	eng	That message was sent by Tom.
3725349	eng	If it's a boy, I want to name the baby Tom.
3725350	eng	We might need the extra room.
3725351	eng	Tom entered the room.
3725352	eng	The conversation ended abruptly when Tom entered the room.
3725353	eng	Tom glanced round the room.
3725354	eng	Tom stepped inside the room.
3725355	eng	Tom laughed and walked out of the room.
3725356	eng	I was out of the room.
3725357	eng	Tom started to laugh and was joined by everyone in the room.
3725358	eng	Tom was in the room.
3725359	eng	Tom and Mary barricaded themselves in the room.
3725360	eng	Tom showed Mary into the room.
3725361	eng	Let Tom use my dressing room.
3725362	eng	Tom is sleeping on the couch in the living room.
3725363	eng	There isn't much room.
3725364	eng	Tom will be joining you in the observation room.
3725365	eng	Now, why don't we continue this conversation in the other room?
3725366	eng	I'll go see if people are having fun in the other room.
3725367	eng	Your fingerprints were all over Tom's room.
3725368	eng	There's a lot of tension in this room.
3725369	eng	There may be something in the next room.
3725370	eng	There may be somebody in the next room.
3725371	eng	Tom glanced round the bedroom.
3725372	eng	I have to use the bathroom.
3725373	eng	I have to use the restroom.
3725374	eng	That's why I suggested that we build a playroom.
3725375	eng	I had no idea where it came from.
3725376	eng	I know where it came from.
3725377	eng	I know where I come from.
3725378	eng	I'd like to know who that phone call was from.
3725379	eng	Nobody really knows where it comes from.
3725380	eng	Tom, this isn't something you can run away from.
3725381	eng	I want this building searched from top to bottom.
3725382	eng	Tom touched my arm.
3725383	eng	You've done enough harm.
3725384	eng	We mean Tom no harm.
3725385	eng	It'll work like a charm.
3725386	eng	You're my good luck charm.
3725387	eng	Tom served a three-year prison term.
3725388	eng	They were firm.
3725389	eng	I'm the office manager of a small law firm.
3725390	eng	Tom is wearing what looks like a military uniform.
3725391	eng	Spare me the sarcasm.
3725392	eng	I didn't mean that as a criticism.
3725393	eng	Tom is at the podium.
3725394	eng	Tom did the bare minimum.
3725395	eng	I couldn't afford to get you a new drum.
3725396	eng	I'm going to hit the gym.
3725397	eng	I'll continue here as long as I can.
3725398	eng	I'll continue working here as long as I can.
3725399	eng	I'd like to get Tom ready as soon as we can.
3725400	eng	Let's salvage what we can.
3725401	eng	Tom was spotted running east on Park Street, followed by a dark sedan.
3725402	eng	I need to come clean.
3725403	eng	I think it's time to come clean.
3725404	eng	The boat was clean.
3725405	eng	I don't know what I mean.
3725406	eng	It's obvious that Tom is a skilled musician.
3725407	eng	Tom is an excellent physician.
3725408	eng	You're the historian.
3725409	eng	It sounds like a plan.
3725410	eng	That sounds like a plan.
3725411	eng	It's a plan.
3725412	eng	That's part of the plan.
3725413	eng	Tom wasn't real receptive to the plan.
3725414	eng	Maybe Tom wasn't sticking with the original plan.
3725415	eng	I'm glad to see everything's going according to plan.
3725416	eng	We had a master plan.
3725417	eng	We're going to go with your plan.
3725418	eng	Tom is just an ordinary man.
3725419	eng	Tom looks every inch a gentleman.
3725420	eng	I'm an old woman.
3725421	eng	You need a good woman.
3725422	eng	I just met the most amazing woman.
3725423	eng	Tom applied for a job as a salesman.
3725424	eng	Tom lost his job as a used car salesman.
3725425	eng	Tom is a respectable businessman.
3725426	eng	You're quite a craftsman.
3725427	eng	They are almost human.
3725428	eng	Tom was an artilleryman.
3725429	eng	We're at war with Japan.
3725430	eng	We're not at war with Japan.
3725431	eng	I'm taking the minivan.
3725432	eng	I don't know what's got into you all of a sudden.
3725433	eng	It was a little sudden.
3725434	eng	Tom and Mary were nowhere to be seen.
3725435	eng	Tom is still nowhere to be seen.
3725436	eng	I'm not too encouraged by what I've seen.
3725437	eng	Tom is nowhere to been seen.
3725438	eng	This is the biggest publicity stunt I've ever seen.
3725439	eng	That's the worst mug shot I've ever seen.
3725440	eng	I've been on my own since I was thirteen.
3725441	eng	I told you that my dad died when I was thirteen.
3725442	eng	You're such a drama queen.
3725443	eng	We'll be dining in the kitchen.
3725444	eng	I guess I'll catch Tom later then.
3725445	eng	Tom sat in the chair to have his picture taken.
3725446	eng	You're sadly mistaken.
3725447	eng	Tom is no spring chicken.
3725448	eng	Tom reported his car stolen.
3725449	eng	I want to see if I can find out what happened to those men.
3725450	eng	They were all strong men.
3725451	eng	This is a product for men.
3725452	eng	These are dangerous men.
3725453	eng	I just never will understand women.
3725454	eng	Tom, there are people who think that you murdered these women.
3725455	eng	I have the worst luck with women.
3725456	eng	I'm not one of those men who hates women.
3725457	eng	The door was kicked open.
3725458	eng	The window was wide open.
3725459	eng	Tom wants everything out in the open.
3725460	eng	If you have a problem with me, let's get it out in the open.
3725461	eng	Don't go out into the open.
3725462	eng	The heavy door swung open.
3725463	eng	Let's see if we can pry this door open.
3725464	eng	Come in, it's open.
3725465	eng	The rear gate was open.
3725466	eng	Let's get it open.
3725467	eng	I won't let anything bad happen.
3725468	eng	If people get scared enough, anything could happen.
3725469	eng	I should've anticipated that this would happen.
3725470	eng	This is what'll happen.
3725471	eng	Tom looked around as if waiting for something to happen.
3725472	eng	This is what's going to happen.
3725473	eng	Well, it's not going to happen.
3725474	eng	Don't worry, it's not going to happen.
3725475	eng	This is really going to happen.
3725476	eng	That's a disaster waiting to happen.
3725477	eng	Tom was an accident waiting to happen.
3725478	eng	This place is an accident waiting to happen.
3725479	eng	Nothing has to happen.
3725480	eng	I couldn't allow that to happen.
3725481	eng	We can make this happen.
3725482	eng	We can't stand by and let this happen.
3725483	eng	I could make that happen.
3725484	eng	I could really make that happen.
3725485	eng	I guess our job is not to let that happen.
3725486	eng	I had to consider what might happen.
3725487	eng	I just want it to actually happen.
3725488	eng	Most men I meet aren't interested in children.
3725489	eng	Tom has always been very protective of his children.
3725490	eng	In case something goes wrong, please take care of my children.
3725491	eng	Tom never cried, no matter how badly he was beaten.
3725492	eng	Tom leaned forward to listen.
3725493	eng	Tom leaned down to listen.
3725494	eng	I didn't say this was heaven.
3725495	eng	That's got to be a good sign.
3725496	eng	I guess that's a good sign.
3725497	eng	That's usually a good sign.
3725498	eng	I have some checks for Tom to sign.
3725499	eng	I'm impressed by your design.
3725500	eng	Tom must not be permitted to resign.
3725501	eng	I've been under considerable pressure to resign.
3725502	eng	Tom talked his daughter out of marrying John.
3725503	eng	Tom probably didn't think it was likely that Mary would fall in love with John.
3725504	eng	Tom has already checked in.
3725505	eng	Tom is all tucked in.
3725506	eng	I think you know what I'm interested in.
3725507	eng	I won't let Tom come in.
3725508	eng	You must come in.
3725509	eng	That's where you come in.
3725510	eng	I'll pay the price for what I believe in.
3725511	eng	You've given me nothing to believe in.
3725512	eng	You should turn yourself in.
3725513	eng	Anyone could just walk in.
3725514	eng	Tom paused to let it sink in.
3725515	eng	Just let Tom in.
3725516	eng	You should turn in.
3725517	eng	They want me to go in.
3725518	eng	Tom let me sleep in.
3725519	eng	I can get us in.
3725520	eng	Tom is doing his best to fit in.
3725521	eng	Extensive rainfall is expected throughout the region.
3725522	deu	Tom und Maria waren völlig aus dem Häuschen, als ihre Tochter die ersten Schritte ging.
3725523	eng	Tom was feeling on top of the world after getting a promotion.
3725524	deu	Falls etwas schiefgeht, bitte kümmere dich um meine Kinder.
3725525	deu	Du wirst hinunterfallen.
3725526	deu	Er versprach, ihn im Café zu treffen.
3725527	deu	Sie interessieren sich für das Schwimmen.
3725528	deu	Wägen Sie Ihre Worte gut ab.
3725529	deu	Wäge deine Worte gut ab.
3725531	deu	Du bist keine Sängerin.
3725532	deu	Wenn sie nicht zufrieden sind, sollen sie mich einfach hinauswerfen.
3725533	eng	That's how Tom got in.
3725534	eng	The last thing I want to do is butt in.
3725535	eng	I can get you in.
3725536	eng	You wouldn't have come if you didn't think there was something to gain.
3725537	eng	Tom nodded again.
3725538	eng	Tom whistled again.
3725539	eng	Tom screamed again.
3725540	eng	The door opened again.
3725541	eng	Tom sneezed again.
3725542	eng	Don't you ever slap Tom around again.
3725543	eng	Tom is full of confidence again.
3725544	eng	I'd feel happier if you three went outside again.
3725545	eng	Tom spoke again.
3725546	eng	Tom said he'd never see me again.
3725547	eng	You must not fail me again.
3725548	eng	Someone may try to kill me again.
3725549	eng	Tom has lied to me again.
3725550	eng	Tom has done it to me again.
3725551	eng	I don't want to see you down here again.
3725552	eng	We had intended never to go there again.
3725553	eng	Tom might not want to get too close again.
3725554	eng	You're being negative again.
3725555	eng	You're showing off again.
3725556	eng	I won't blow you off again.
3725557	eng	Tom is just crying wolf again.
3725558	eng	Tom's right eye is twitching again.
3725559	eng	I'd like to get this working again.
3725560	eng	I can prevent that from happening again.
3725561	eng	I had that dream again.
3725562	eng	I never laid eyes on Tom again.
3725563	eng	The music began again.
3725564	eng	Tom never turned up again.
3725565	eng	We'll be together again.
3725566	eng	I don't want to lose you ever again.
3725567	eng	I read it over again.
3725568	eng	Tom opened his eyes again.
3725569	eng	Tom closed his eyes again.
3725570	eng	Tom shut his eyes again.
3725571	eng	I'm going to read this again.
3725572	eng	Let's try this again.
3725573	eng	Tom went upstairs again.
3725574	eng	It's a pleasure to have you with us again.
3725575	eng	Tom never wore that hat again.
3725576	eng	I suppose we won't meet again.
3725577	eng	All is quiet again.
3725578	eng	I'm not having this fight again.
3725579	eng	You'll see it again.
3725580	eng	I should've known I'd never see it again.
3725581	eng	I'm delighted to see you again.
3725582	eng	I couldn't bear to lose you again.
3725583	eng	I don't ever want to lose you again.
3725584	eng	Look, I'm not going to tell you again.
3725585	eng	I'll be back in an hour to check on you again.
3725586	eng	Let me know when you want to get underway again.
3725587	eng	Tom became angry again.
3725588	eng	Tom gave Mary a key on a silver chain.
3725589	eng	Somebody's yanking my chain.
3725590	eng	Look, I can explain.
3725591	eng	I don't think we have anything to explain.
3725592	eng	You're getting to be a pain.
3725593	eng	I really hate to see you in such pain.
3725594	eng	Tom is crouched on the floor, writhing in pain.
3725595	eng	Suddenly, Tom grabbed his chest in pain.
3725596	eng	I have a low threshold for pain.
3725597	eng	Tom rubbed his leg in obvious pain.
3725598	eng	Tom is gritting his teeth in obvious pain.
3725599	eng	Tom sought shelter from the rain.
3725600	eng	I'm racking my brain.
3725601	eng	I don't think I'm cut out to be captain.
3725602	eng	You've got to be certain.
3725603	eng	I've been eating protein.
3725604	eng	Tom, maybe you would like to begin.
3725605	eng	Let the games begin.
3725606	eng	Tom rubbed his chin.
3725607	eng	We're stretched a little thin.
3725608	eng	They were thin.
3725609	eng	Tom is doodling on a cocktail napkin.
3725610	eng	Tom blew his nose into his napkin.
3725611	eng	Tom would say anything to save his own skin.
3725612	eng	Tom is just trying to get under your skin.
3725613	eng	Tom nearly jumped out of his skin.
3725614	eng	Tom is getting under my skin.
3725615	eng	Tom played you like a violin.
3725616	eng	You're guilty as sin.
3725617	eng	There's no way of telling who'll win.
3725618	eng	I can't believe you let Tom win.
3725619	eng	You better win.
3725620	eng	I'll try to be a better dad to you from here on.
3725621	eng	Tom bought some land to build a house on.
3725622	eng	Try to hang on.
3725623	eng	Tom felt a headache coming on.
3725624	eng	I don't have anything going on.
3725625	eng	I'm telling you something's going on.
3725626	eng	See what's going on.
3725627	eng	I'd like to stick around and find out what's going on.
3725628	eng	I'll let you know what's going on.
3725629	eng	Tom is clearly upset by what's going on.
3725630	eng	So much is going on.
3725631	eng	Tom is beginning to catch on.
3725632	eng	The party's back on.
3725633	eng	The ceiling fan is on.
3725634	eng	I really don't care what went on.
3725635	eng	I'll have everyone call me Tom from now on.
3725636	eng	You'll be looking after Tom from now on.
3725637	eng	I don't have anyone else to rely on.
3725638	eng	We value your opinion.
3725639	eng	Tom isn't alone in this opinion.
3725640	eng	It's a special occasion.
3725641	eng	Tom will need some persuasion.
3725642	eng	I think you might need to make a decision.
3725643	eng	I'd like to hear your decision.
3725644	eng	I'm waiting for your decision.
3725645	eng	I await your decision.
3725646	eng	Tom had every right to make that decision.
3725647	eng	I need it to be my decision.
3725648	eng	I'm quite comfortable with my decision.
3725649	eng	I just had a vision.
3725650	eng	Tom doesn't require much supervision.
3725651	eng	We need a diversion.
3725652	eng	Tom suffered from depression.
3725653	eng	I think I made a good impression.
3725654	eng	I see you made a good impression.
3725655	eng	Tom didn't want to give the wrong impression.
3725656	eng	I make a horrible first impression.
3725657	eng	It could be a dangerous mission.
3725658	eng	I figured it was better not to do anything without your permission.
3725659	eng	I could've done this without your permission.
3725660	eng	You have a nasty concussion.
3725661	eng	I know you're on vacation.
3725662	eng	I've never seen such dedication.
3725663	eng	Tom isn't on any medication.
3725664	eng	There's been a complication.
3725665	eng	It's an ongoing investigation.
3725666	eng	I'm trying to conduct an investigation.
3725667	eng	I had a revelation.
3725668	eng	There might have been a miscalculation.
3725669	eng	This is only a simulation.
3725670	eng	I've got inside information.
3725671	eng	I just received some very disturbing information.
3725672	eng	They were collecting information.
3725673	eng	Tom gave us some useful information.
3725674	eng	Now, all I need is information.
3725675	eng	Just don't volunteer any new information.
3725676	eng	I'd like to ask you for an explanation.
3725677	eng	The boss asked for Tom's resignation.
3725678	eng	They're all figments of your imagination.
3725679	eng	I'll use my imagination.
3725680	eng	Truth is a goal, not a destination.
3725681	eng	You could've jeopardized the entire operation.
3725682	eng	Tom said that it would be a simple rescue operation.
3725683	eng	Come on, Tom, I need a little cooperation.
3725684	eng	Tom looks like he's had an inspiration.
3725685	eng	You were my inspiration.
3725686	eng	Tom is losing his concentration.
3725687	eng	Tom isn't good at making conversation.
3725688	eng	I'm shocked you could make such an accusation.
3725689	eng	Tom sold his car without hesitation.
3725690	eng	Tom has just been given an invitation.
3725691	eng	I can't believe you missed Tom's graduation.
3725692	eng	Tom is trying to make the best of a bad situation.
3725693	eng	Tom's very much in control of the situation.
3725694	eng	We're on top of the situation.
3725695	eng	I don't really think that you're helping the situation.
3725696	eng	Let's be calm and consider the situation.
3725697	eng	We're in the middle of a delicate situation.
3725698	eng	We sympathize with your situation.
3725699	eng	Tom has his doubts about this situation.
3725700	eng	Tom is now in a very difficult situation.
3725701	eng	I've got what looks like an emergency situation.
3725702	eng	I can make a reservation.
3725703	eng	Take evasive action.
3725704	eng	You had a perfectly normal reaction.
3725705	eng	Tom could barely hide his reaction.
3725706	eng	I can see how that might be your first reaction.
3725707	eng	I won't give them the satisfaction.
3725708	eng	I think Tom won the election.
3725709	eng	I could never win an election.
3725710	eng	Tom couldn't calculate the price of the collection.
3725711	eng	I thought we had a real connection.
3725712	eng	Everyone in the room looked in Tom's direction.
3725713	eng	Perhaps you could point us in the right direction.
3725714	eng	Tom didn't think he needed protection.
3725715	eng	Let's just say it's for your own protection.
3725716	eng	It's for your protection.
3725717	eng	You're under my protection.
3725718	eng	I don't see it as a contradiction.
3725719	eng	Tom had no ambition.
3725720	eng	I have a skin condition.
3725721	eng	I know about your condition.
3725722	eng	Tom got in the truck and turned the key in the ignition.
3725723	eng	You know my position.
3725724	eng	You just bought yourself another day of detention.
3725725	eng	I can see why that caught your attention.
3725726	eng	That's why you got the promotion.
3725727	eng	That's an amusing notion.
3725728	eng	You have a visitor in reception.
3725729	eng	I can see how you might have that misconception.
3725730	eng	Maybe it's a question of perception.
3725731	eng	Thank you for giving me the option.
3725732	eng	That was never an option.
3725733	eng	Letting Tom go wasn't an option.
3725734	eng	Staying here isn't an option.
3725735	eng	That's hardly an option.
3725736	eng	Tom was put up for adoption.
3725737	eng	Don't blow things out of proportion.
3725738	eng	That's not a question.
3725739	eng	Tom sidestepped the question.
3725740	eng	Tom kindly answered the question.
3725741	eng	A plea bargain is out of the question.
3725742	eng	Tom didn't quite know how to respond to the question.
3725743	eng	Tom needs to answer the question.
3725744	eng	Tom was a little surprised by the question.
3725745	eng	Let me ask Tom a simple question.
3725746	eng	I could ask you the same question.
3725747	eng	That's a mighty fine question.
3725748	eng	It was a legitimate question.
3725749	eng	That's a really provocative question.
3725750	eng	I have just one small question.
3725751	eng	Your sanity isn't in question.
3725752	eng	I believe that answers your question.
3725753	eng	Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
3725754	eng	I'm done with this question.
3725755	eng	I'm not in a position to answer that question.
3725756	eng	Tom couldn't resist asking Mary that question.
3725757	eng	Perhaps we should ask a different question.
3725758	eng	Tom proceeded to the next question.
3725759	eng	Tom nodded in response to my question.
3725760	eng	That seems to be a sensible precaution.
3725761	eng	We have an elegant solution.
3725762	eng	I'm glad we already have so much in common.
3725763	eng	It's barely noon.
3725764	eng	I'm taking my boat out this afternoon.
3725765	eng	It was a great afternoon.
3725766	eng	I have a meeting with Tom tomorrow afternoon.
3725767	eng	Everyone hopes the recession will end soon.
3725768	eng	Your time will come soon.
3725769	eng	It'll wear off soon.
3725770	eng	Don't worry, you'll get your voice back soon.
3725771	eng	Tom didn't come too soon.
3725772	eng	You'll be one of us soon.
3725773	eng	We'll have you back here very soon.
3725774	eng	I have a feeling you'll be going very soon.
3725775	eng	Tom looked for a weapon.
3725776	eng	Maybe you should give me that weapon.
3725777	eng	Tom had always wanted a son.
3725778	eng	I think Tom would be a good name for our son.
3725779	eng	Tom told me he had information on your son.
3725780	eng	I want to be a father to your son.
3725781	eng	Tom embraced his son.
3725782	eng	You said Tom loved his son.
3725783	eng	Tom couldn't find his son.
3725784	eng	Tom was friends with my son.
3725785	eng	Get away from my son.
3725786	eng	I don't like to smile unless I have a reason.
3725787	eng	I brought you here for a reason.
3725788	eng	Tell me there's a reason.
3725789	eng	Tom might have done the right thing for the wrong reason.
3725790	eng	That isn't a good enough reason.
3725791	eng	That's not a good enough reason.
3725792	eng	I thought you had another reason.
3725793	eng	It'd be treason.
3725794	eng	I'm placing you under arrest for treason.
3725795	eng	It's now planting season.
3725796	eng	I know Tom will eventually get out of prison.
3725797	eng	They've both been released from prison.
3725798	eng	Tom wouldn't last a month in prison.
3725799	eng	I think Tom is still in prison.
3725800	eng	I want to make sure people like you end up in prison.
3725801	eng	You're going back to prison.
3725802	eng	I won't go back to prison.
3725803	eng	Tom went to prison.
3725804	eng	We're charging you with the murder of Tom Jackson.
3725805	eng	The name on the card is Tom Jackson.
3725806	eng	I've always felt more like a tiger than a person.
3725807	eng	You're a very privileged person.
3725808	eng	Tom isn't a stable person.
3725809	eng	I'm a people person.
3725810	eng	You're a very perceptive person.
3725811	eng	You're a strong person.
3725812	eng	You're an evil person.
3725813	eng	Tom isn't a truthful person.
3725814	eng	I can tell you're a warm person.
3725815	eng	Tom is just an ordinary person.
3725816	eng	I'm afraid I'm going to have to teach you a lesson.
3725817	eng	I want to prove to you I've learned my lesson.
3725818	eng	The truth is I've always liked Boston.
3725819	eng	If I were you, I would quit my job and leave Boston.
3725820	eng	It's Tom calling from Boston.
3725821	eng	I'm planning on getting a job in Boston.
3725822	eng	I went home and told my wife about the job in Boston.
3725823	eng	You're finished in Boston.
3725824	eng	Tom's friend is getting married in Boston.
3725825	eng	Tom bragged about what happened in Boston.
3725826	eng	Tom is stationed in Boston.
3725827	eng	I have a wife back home in Boston.
3725828	eng	Tom returned to his home in Boston.
3725829	eng	I'm not ready to run a car dealership in Boston.
3725830	eng	Tom and I partied together one night last year in Boston.
3725831	eng	We met after your show the other night in Boston.
3725832	eng	Well, one day I'll buy you a beer and you can tell me about the time you spent in Boston.
3725833	eng	I need you in Boston.
3725834	eng	I think I have about enough time to get the train to Boston.
3725835	eng	It's not like I really want to go to Boston.
3725836	eng	Tom disapproved of my trip to Boston.
3725837	eng	We've got a charter flight waiting to take us to Boston.
3725838	eng	We're trying to get to Boston.
3725839	eng	Tom took a commercial flight to Boston.
3725840	eng	Tom, I need you on the next flight to Boston.
3725841	eng	We picked a hitchhiker up on the way to Boston.
3725842	eng	We're halfway to Boston.
3725843	eng	Tom used to ask me so many questions about Boston.
3725844	eng	Tom put some change into the vending machine and punched a button.
3725845	eng	Tom pushed the speaker phone button.
3725846	eng	My biggest problem will be deciding what to do with all the money I just won.
3725847	eng	Tom feigned concern.
3725848	eng	Tom and Mary exchanged a look of concern.
3725849	eng	That's of no concern.
3725850	eng	Your safety isn't our concern.
3725851	eng	My relationship with Tom isn't your concern.
3725852	eng	I'm going to make Tom wish he'd never been born.
3725853	eng	This is no time to be stubborn.
3725854	eng	We need time to mourn.
3725855	eng	I don't know where else to turn.
3725856	eng	I have nowhere else to turn.
3725857	eng	I don't have anywhere else to turn.
3725858	eng	I want something in return.
3725859	eng	I may not return.
3725860	eng	That's part of the fun.
3725861	eng	You used to be so much fun.
3725862	eng	I wish you didn't look like you were having so much fun.
3725863	eng	You've had your fun.
3725864	eng	Let Tom have his fun.
3725865	eng	Being a policeman isn't any fun.
3725866	eng	The guy had a gun.
3725867	eng	I've never even touched a gun.
3725868	eng	I don't wear a gun.
3725869	eng	We have them on the run.
3725870	eng	We'll be better off in the long run.
3725871	eng	Tom tried to run.
3725872	eng	Tom started to run.
3725873	eng	You better run.
3725874	eng	You will be on your own.
3725875	eng	I think you need to figure this out on your own.
3725876	eng	I think you've got to work this out on your own.
3725877	eng	I'm told that Tom likes to work on his own.
3725878	eng	Tom's personal life is his own.
3725879	eng	I've been doing some calculations of my own.
3725880	eng	I don't know how I'd survive on my own.
3725881	eng	The laughter died down.
3725882	eng	I think Tom has calmed down.
3725883	eng	I heard that Tom was gunned down.
3725884	eng	The car slowed down.
3725885	eng	I let my guard down.
3725886	eng	I need you to keep your voice down.
3725887	eng	Tom knows I'm not the type to settle down.
3725888	eng	You wore me down.
3725889	eng	You're bringing me down.
3725890	eng	I don't want those guys hunting me down.
3725891	eng	I'm supposed to track someone down.
3725892	eng	Pipe down.
3725893	eng	Put the bag down.
3725894	eng	Tom feared falling down.
3725895	eng	Tom isn't about to back down.
3725896	eng	Tom wouldn't back down.
3725897	eng	I think a drink would help me calm down.
3725898	eng	I think we need to all calm down.
3725899	eng	I think everybody should try to calm down.
3725900	eng	We're trying to track Tom down.
3725901	eng	I'm closing this operation down.
3725902	eng	Tom put his glass down.
3725903	eng	They turned us down.
3725904	eng	That's how it went down.
3725905	eng	I'm putting my foot down.
3725906	eng	I'm going to put my foot down.
3725907	eng	I feel like I let you down.
3725908	eng	The fuse is blown.
3725909	eng	We'll begin a systematic search of the town.
3725910	eng	We're the talk of the town.
3725911	eng	The circus is in town.
3725912	eng	Tom Jackson practically built this town.
3725913	eng	I'm going to drop you off downtown.
3725914	eng	Tom has got more restraint than I do.
3725915	eng	You know you want it to happen as much as I do.
3725916	eng	You need sleep as much as I do.
3725917	eng	Tom has the same rash as I do.
3725918	eng	You know that as well as I do.
3725919	eng	It's what I'd do.
3725920	eng	There's something we could do.
3725921	eng	You know what I think we should do.
3725922	eng	It's not what we do.
3725923	eng	I think that'll do.
3725924	eng	I guess that'll do.
3725925	eng	Never tell the truth when a lie will do.
3725926	eng	There's only one thing I can do.
3725927	eng	I'll tell you what I can do.
3725928	eng	Tom knows there's only one thing he can do.
3725929	eng	It's the only thing Tom can do.
3725930	eng	I didn't care what I had to do.
3725931	eng	Tom realized what he had to do.

3725986	eng	This isn't an easy thing for Tom to do.
3725987	eng	That's what Tom likes to do.
3725988	eng	That's not something Tom really wants to do.
3725989	eng	I see no reason for us to do what Tom told us to do.
3725990	eng	You're in no position to tell me what to do.
3725991	eng	We don't need Tom telling us what to do.
3725992	eng	We were hoping you could tell us what to do.
3725993	eng	That's exactly the kind of thing I don't want to do.

3726001	eng	I've never seen anyone enjoy reading as much as you do.
3726002	eng	We care for Tom as much as you do.
3726003	eng	Tom doesn't kiss nearly as well as you do.
3726004	eng	I have no control over what you do.
3726005	eng	Tom clicked the remote to stop the video.
3726006	eng	I'm going to give it a go.
3726007	eng	It's too late for me, but you could go.
3726008	eng	You need to let this one go.
3726009	eng	Of course Tom will go.
3726010	eng	I never should've let Tom go.
3726011	eng	I can't believe you just let Tom go.
3726012	eng	Just let the woman go.
3726013	eng	Tom turned to go.
3726014	eng	I didn't ask whether you wanted to go.
3726015	eng	We're good to go.
3726016	eng	I assume we're free to go.
3726017	eng	Look, I have to go.
3726018	eng	There's nowhere for Tom to go.
3726019	eng	You're clear to go.
3726020	eng	I'll see to it that you get to go.
3726022	eng	The party's over. You've got to go.
3726023	eng	That's not the way to go.
3726024	eng	We better go.
3726025	eng	You better go.
3726026	eng	OK, people, let's go.
3726027	eng	You know how these things go.
3726028	eng	Something told me you wouldn't let this go.
3726029	eng	I let it go.
3726030	eng	We're letting you go.
3726031	eng	That's why we let you go.
3726032	eng	I couldn't just let you go.
3726033	eng	Tom should've never let Mary go.
3726034	eng	You lost me a long time ago.
3726035	eng	I needed you a long time ago.
3726036	eng	Tom was pretty worked up about an hour ago.
3726037	eng	I asked for this thirty minutes ago.
3726038	eng	You should have enrolled your children months ago.
3726039	eng	Tom died in his sleep three years ago.
3726040	eng	Tom isn't what he was three years ago.
3726041	eng	Tom's wife died a few years ago.
3726042	eng	You're just like Tom was thirty years ago.
3726043	eng	You should've been asleep hours ago.
3726044	eng	Tom nearly killed himself a few hours ago.
3726045	eng	Tom just bought it a couple of days ago.
3726046	eng	Tom went missing several days ago.
3726047	eng	Tom's parents sent him to Boston because he kept getting into trouble in Chicago.
3726048	eng	I gave Tom a coffee mug with our company logo.
3726049	eng	Tom sang along with the radio.
3726050	eng	Tom turned the dial on the radio.
3726051	eng	Tom smiled hello.
3726052	eng	Somebody should say hello.
3726053	eng	Tom told me I should go, but I said no.
3726054	eng	Hey, if that's what you want to do, I'm not going to say no.
3726055	eng	Remember, Tom, just say no.
3726056	eng	Tom didn't exactly say no.
3726057	eng	I still say we should've bought that piano.
3726058	eng	Tom is probably dead, too.
3726059	eng	Tom laughed, too.
3726060	eng	I've been getting a little sunburned, too.
3726061	eng	Tom's got a real bad headache, too.
3726062	eng	Get me a slice of pie, too.
3726063	eng	I know you care about me, too.
3726064	eng	I imagine that's what's going to happen the next time, too.
3726065	eng	I can only guess that you probably want one, too.
3726066	eng	That's what I was wondering, too.
3726067	eng	I'm under suspicion, too.
3726068	eng	I know what you were thinking, because I was thinking it, too.
3726069	eng	I know what you were feeling, because I was feeling it, too.
3726070	eng	That's what I want, too.
3726071	eng	I've allowed for that possibility, too.
3726072	eng	Tom was a war hero.
3726073	eng	I intend to go on doing so.
3726074	eng	You're authorized to do so.
3726075	eng	You were wise to do so.
3726076	eng	I remember telling you so.
3726077	eng	Don't let anyone in there without Tom's say-so.
3726078	eng	If you don't understand what's going on, just say so.
3726079	eng	If you don't understand a question, just say so.
3726080	eng	Tom didn't want to reveal more than he had to.
3726081	eng	It's not nice being lied to.
3726082	eng	It's a lot to get used to.
3726083	eng	I can't go even if I wanted to.
3726084	eng	I can put it back in the drawer if you want me to.
3726085	eng	I can arrest you if I have to.
3726086	eng	Tell us exactly where you're heading to.
3726087	eng	I forgot who I was talking to.
3726088	eng	I've got someone here you might want to talk to.
3726089	eng	Find somebody to talk to.
3726090	eng	Tom has nowhere to run to.
3726091	eng	You gave me something to live up to.
3726092	eng	I want to know what Tom's up to.
3726093	eng	I think I'm going to go see what Tom is up to.
3726094	eng	I need you in my office pronto.
3726095	eng	Tom is wanted for grand theft auto.
3726096	eng	We must never confuse the two.
3726097	eng	I've been known to tell a joke or two.
3726098	eng	These are so cheap. We should buy enough for the next year or two.
3726099	eng	They'll put you up for a day or two.
3726100	eng	Settle down you two.
3726101	eng	That's a wrap.
3726102	eng	It must be the company I keep.
3726103	eng	You had quite a sleep.
3726104	eng	Tom got eight hours of uninterrupted sleep.
3726105	eng	I suggested that Tom get some sleep.
3726106	eng	Tom was allowed to sleep.
3726107	eng	A couple of these ought to put me to sleep.
3726108	eng	Now I'm definitely not going to sleep.
3726109	eng	Tom hung up the phone and went back to sleep.
3726110	eng	We just got Tom to go to sleep.
3726111	eng	You better sleep.
3726112	eng	Get something to eat and have a good night's sleep.
3726113	eng	It'll help you sleep.
3726114	eng	A noise aroused me from my sleep.
3726115	eng	Tom is lying in bed, asleep.
3726116	eng	Tom was still asleep.
3726117	eng	Tom is lying in bed, fast asleep.
3726118	eng	Get lost, you creep.
3726119	eng	Read it and weep.
3726120	eng	You have to take the first step.
3726121	eng	You don't give orders on this ship.
3726122	eng	I'm in a relationship.
3726123	eng	We've always had a good relationship.
3726124	eng	Tom has never been in a serious relationship.
3726125	eng	Tom will be denied membership.
3726126	eng	Tom chewed his lip.
3726127	eng	Don't give me any lip.
3726128	eng	Tom is making preparations for a trip.
3726129	eng	I know it's been a long trip.
3726130	eng	We'll do our best to make it an uneventful trip.
3726131	eng	If they asked, we could help.
3726132	eng	Tom is beyond help.
3726133	eng	Tom gestured for Mary to come help.
3726134	eng	I could do with some help.
3726135	eng	Tom's too far gone to help.
3726136	eng	I refuse to help.
3726137	eng	We're more than willing to help.
3726138	eng	That medicine isn't going to help.
3726139	eng	Tom clearly wants to help.
3726140	eng	I believe you want to help.
3726141	eng	Tom was only too happy to help.
3726142	eng	Tom is ashamed to ask for help.
3726143	eng	Tom is too proud to ask others for help.
3726144	eng	Tom was anxious for help.
3726145	eng	The country needs your help.
3726146	eng	I need to enlist your help.
3726147	eng	I want Tom to know that we appreciate his help.
3726148	eng	It doesn't help.
3726149	eng	My palms are damp.
3726150	eng	We hit a bump.
3726151	eng	Tom seems to be in a slump.
3726152	eng	That's why you're a cop.
3726153	eng	I'm an undercover cop.
3726154	eng	Tom is in the office working on his laptop.
3726155	eng	Tom's car screeched to a stop.
3726156	eng	We have an unscheduled stop.
3726157	eng	I just wanted to stop.
3726158	eng	When's this going to stop.
3726159	eng	I'm not about to stop.
3726160	eng	I heard Tom gasp.
3726161	eng	Tom heard Mary gasp.
3726162	eng	I know where you ended up.
3726163	eng	Tom has been roughed up.
3726164	eng	You're all washed up.
3726165	eng	I'm washed up.
3726166	eng	Call when you want to be picked up.
3726167	eng	Tom is all worked up.
3726168	eng	The crowd was worked up.
3726169	eng	I know where Tom is holed up.
3726170	eng	I don't believe in keeping my feelings bottled up.
3726171	eng	I've already got a buyer lined up.
3726172	eng	Tom seemed pretty messed up.
3726173	eng	Tom knows he's really screwed up.
3726174	eng	Tom is lying flat on the floor, face up.
3726175	eng	Tom is going to try and blow the place up.
3726176	eng	I just thought we could make up.
3726177	eng	I can't believe you stood me up.
3726178	eng	I need you to back me up.
3726179	eng	Tom really cracks me up.
3726180	eng	It never really came up.
3726181	eng	Something else has just come up.
3726182	eng	Tom just doesn't measure up.
3726183	eng	I never saw you as the type of person who'd give up.
3726184	eng	Tom is standing up.
3726185	eng	I've got a window that needs boarding up.
3726186	eng	I was just finishing up.
3726187	eng	I need to clear something up.
3726188	eng	I didn't open anything up.
3726189	eng	That could've screwed everything up.
3726190	eng	I'll screw everything up.
3726191	eng	Tom may have died without ever waking up.
3726192	eng	I was just closing up.
3726193	eng	Tom is just finishing setting up.
3726194	eng	We're not splitting up.
3726195	eng	The point is, we aren't giving up.
3726196	eng	It's all Tom can do to catch up.
3726197	eng	We better wash up.
3726198	eng	Tom was badly shook up.
3726199	eng	I know you're making it all up.
3726200	eng	You guys should team up.
3726201	eng	Tom is pretty shaken up.
3726202	eng	OK people, listen up.
3726203	eng	I'll let you know what we turn up.
3726204	eng	Wow, you've really grown up.
3726205	eng	I could tell something was up.
3726206	eng	Tom packed his things up.
3726207	eng	It's difficult to tell which side is up.
3726208	eng	You screwed this up.
3726209	eng	Please tell me you're making this up.
3726210	eng	We can't keep this up.
3726211	eng	I didn't make those answers up.
3726212	eng	We're three floors up.
3726213	eng	Tom is pretty beat up.
3726214	eng	Tom made himself get up.
3726215	eng	If I sit down, I'm afraid I wouldn't want to get up.
3726216	eng	I don't appreciate being set up.
3726217	eng	I knew I was being set up.
3726218	eng	I think you've been set up.
3726219	eng	Somebody must've picked it up.
3726220	eng	I don't think Tom made it up.
3726221	eng	I got to be pretty good at guitar before I gave it up.
3726222	eng	Something told me not to pick it up.
3726223	eng	That about wraps it up.
3726224	eng	That's why I brought it up.
3726225	eng	I'm embarrassed I even brought it up.
3726226	eng	It's not safe to split up.
3726227	eng	Tom got up.
3726228	eng	I'm not trying to pick you up.
3726229	eng	Someone told me to look you up.
3726230	eng	Maybe this'll cheer you up.
3726231	eng	They'll cheer you up.
3726232	eng	They'll put you up.
3726233	eng	That's where I grew up.
3726234	eng	It's time you grew up.
3726235	eng	I can't believe Tom has the nerve to show up.
3726236	eng	I think I'm going to throw up.
3726237	eng	Tom looks like he's going to throw up.
3726238	eng	I just wanted to give you a heads-up.
3726239	eng	Tom set down his cup.
3726240	eng	I'm going to need some backup.
3726241	eng	Tom served in the Gulf War.
3726242	eng	Tom is the only customer in the bar.
3726243	eng	Tom was cowering behind his bar.
3726244	eng	You don't even have a car.
3726245	eng	Tom can't buy himself a car.
3726246	eng	I assume I'll have access to a car.
3726247	eng	I need to grab something from the car.
3726248	eng	My kid was in the car.
3726249	eng	Tom has been waiting for ten minutes in the car.
3726250	eng	I kept walking to the car.
3726251	eng	Tom leaped into the car.
3726252	eng	Tom swerved hard, losing control of his car.
3726253	eng	Tom walked away from his car.
3726254	eng	I don't want another car, I want my car.
3726255	eng	Tom is grinning from ear to ear.
3726256	eng	Let me whisper in your ear.
3726257	eng	Tom started the engine and put it in gear.
3726258	eng	Collect your gear.
3726259	eng	That was the last thing I expected to hear.
3726260	eng	That's what I like to hear.
3726261	eng	I'm not going to say anything you want to hear.
3726262	eng	Tom kept his voice low so nobody could overhear.
3726263	eng	The rules are clear.
3726264	eng	I don't know how to be more clear.
3726265	eng	Let me make one thing clear.
3726266	eng	The law is clear.
3726267	eng	I know you're near.
3726268	eng	Tom couldn't seem to find anything suitable to wear.
3726269	eng	I didn't mean it, I swear.
3726270	eng	I haven't seen you in like a year.
3726271	eng	I almost ran the marathon last year.
3726272	eng	I know you lost your father last year.
3726273	eng	That was last year.
3726274	eng	Tom lost his son early last year.
3726275	eng	It gets better every year.
3726276	eng	I don't know why they have to do this every year.
3726277	eng	Tom couldn't have gotten far.
3726278	eng	Look at what we have so far.
3726279	eng	I didn't mean for it to go this far.
3726280	eng	You don't know what I've had to do to get this far.
3726281	eng	I never thought Tom would make it this far.
3726282	eng	You don't have to go that far.
3726283	eng	I didn't make it very far.
3726284	eng	Tom was smoking a cigar.
3726285	eng	You must be quite a liar.
3726286	eng	That's why you look so familiar.
3726287	eng	You seem really familiar.
3726288	eng	That was pretty peculiar.
3726289	eng	Tom grabbed Mary by the collar.
3726290	eng	This is very irregular.
3726291	eng	You've ruined my chances at being popular.
3726292	eng	Get rid of that stupid guitar.
3726293	eng	There isn't going to be a war.
3726294	eng	We're in the middle of a war.
3726295	eng	Tom looks like a prisoner of war.
3726296	eng	That's what I remember.
3726297	eng	I'll tell you what I remember.
3726298	eng	It's hard to remember.
3726299	eng	Just take a number.
3726300	eng	Tom tried to get Mary's phone number.
3726301	eng	Hey, I should get your number.
3726302	eng	I was told I could reach Tom at this number.
3726303	eng	The mood is sober.
3726304	eng	I know about your cancer.
3726305	eng	Tom isn't a charismatic leader.
3726306	eng	You're not exactly an outsider.
3726307	eng	Tom gently touched Mary's shoulder.
3726308	eng	Tom nudged Mary with his shoulder.
3726309	eng	Tom rested his hand on my shoulder.
3726310	eng	I don't need you looking over my shoulder.
3726311	eng	I don't want you looking over my shoulder.
3726312	eng	You have three minutes to surrender.
3726313	eng	I could've been a contender.
3726314	eng	My dog cowers under the table whenever he hears thunder.
3726315	eng	I feel like you should have to work a little harder.
3726316	eng	It's getting harder.
3726317	eng	No one fires until I give the order.
3726318	eng	You have only to give the order.
3726319	eng	It's a special order.
3726320	eng	Your papers seem to be in order.
3726321	eng	I'm told congratulations are in order.
3726322	eng	I suppose congratulations are in order.
3726323	eng	Everything looks in order.

3726353	eng	It'd be safer to do it my way.
3726354	eng	I appreciate the offer.
3726355	eng	I have so much to offer.
3726356	eng	Tom was completely surprised by Mary's offer.
3726357	eng	Tom is withdrawing his offer.

3726583	eng	I'll try to pop in later.
3726584	eng	Maybe we can catch up later.
3726585	eng	We can take this up later.
3726586	eng	Tom knew it would happen sooner or later.
3726587	eng	Tom returned home three hours later.
3726588	eng	Tom arrived three days later.
3726589	eng	Catch you guys later.
3726590	eng	Just give me my share of the water.
3726591	eng	Tom stayed in the water.
3726592	eng	Tom's lifeless body floated on the water.
3726593	eng	Maybe I should go get you some water.
3726594	eng	Tom was carrying a glass of water.
3726595	eng	I've always found Tom to be a good judge of character.
3726596	eng	I've always said Tom is an excellent judge of character.
3726597	eng	You're not the one we're after.
3726598	eng	Tom always wanted a daughter.
3726599	eng	Tom is married with a three-year-old daughter.
3726600	eng	Tom was married to Mary's oldest daughter.
3726601	eng	I don't want you anywhere near my daughter.
3726602	eng	Hello, I'm Tom and I'll be your waiter.
3726603	eng	Tom is a published writer.
3726604	eng	You're the writer.
3726605	eng	Tom is a speech writer.
3726606	eng	Tom bought three packages of ink for his printer.
3726607	eng	Tom's pulse beat faster.
3726608	eng	The walls are white plaster.
3726609	eng	It's not going to be a disaster.
3726610	eng	My life is a disaster.
3726611	eng	Everything goes in the dumpster.
3726612	eng	That happens to be an unrelated matter.
3726613	eng	Let's cut right to the heart of the matter.
3726614	eng	I can try to talk to Tom about the matter.
3726615	eng	This is a grave matter.
3726616	eng	I'd like to have a word with you on another matter.
3726617	eng	Well, I've had better.
3726618	eng	You've looked better.
3726619	eng	I just want my dad to be better.
3726620	eng	The less delay, the better.
3726621	eng	The sooner they leave the better.
3726622	eng	At least now I understand Tom a little better.
3726623	eng	You could do so much better.
3726624	eng	I knew you could do so much better.
3726625	eng	It made me feel better.
3726626	eng	Tom began to feel better.
3726627	eng	That should make you feel better.
3726628	eng	Maybe it's time you got to know Tom better.
3726629	eng	Well, I've been better.
3726630	eng	I'm sure it will get better.
3726631	eng	I just want my dad to get better.
3726632	eng	All we can do is hope things get better.
3726633	eng	It will only get better.
3726634	eng	I can always make it better.
3726635	eng	That'll make Tom feel a lot better.
3726636	eng	I've never slept better.
3726637	eng	I want to get to know my father-in-law better.
3726638	eng	It's not likely to get any better.
3726639	eng	Tom lost no time answering the letter.
3726640	eng	Tom responded very quickly to my letter.
3726641	eng	Tom is a potential babysitter.
3726642	eng	The room gradually got hotter.
3726643	eng	I don't need a computer.
3726644	eng	It's only a computer.
3726645	eng	Tom is in his office sitting at his computer.
3726646	eng	Tom is more determined than ever.
3726647	eng	Tom needs you now more than ever.
3726648	eng	Tom is the worst director ever.
3726649	eng	Tom is running a fever.
3726650	eng	Tom seems to have a touch of fever.
3726651	eng	I suppose you think you're very clever.
3726652	eng	I suppose you think that was pretty clever.
3726653	eng	You can't protect Tom forever.
3726654	eng	I haven't seen you in forever.
3726655	eng	We can't live together forever.
3726656	eng	Tom and I'll be best friends forever.
3726657	eng	Tom has left us forever.
3726658	eng	You're the driver.
3726659	eng	Tom is the fastest driver.
3726660	eng	It'll never be over.
3726661	eng	We have to pull over.
3726662	eng	We'll have a sleep over.
3726663	eng	Thank goodness that's over.
3726664	eng	Tom is glad it's over.
3726665	eng	Tom won't even know what you did until it's over.
3726666	eng	I'll let you know when it's over.
3726667	eng	Tell me this is over.
3726668	eng	I guess this is over.
3726669	eng	This interview is over.
3726670	eng	Dinner is almost over.
3726671	eng	I can't believe this is really over.
3726672	eng	Keep under cover.
3726673	eng	Everyone ran for cover.
3726674	eng	Tom didn't want to blow his cover.
3726675	eng	Tom needs to recover.
3726676	eng	I'm going to hit the shower.
3726677	eng	I've turned off most of the lights to save power.
3726678	eng	You already know the answer.
3726679	eng	Tom gave an evasive answer.
3726680	eng	That's not a good enough answer.
3726681	eng	I think I deserve an answer.
3726682	eng	I'm not even going to dignify that with an answer.
3726683	eng	Tom asked Mary a question, but didn't bother waiting for an answer.
3726684	eng	I really can't take no for an answer.
3726685	eng	Tom wants an answer.
3726686	eng	There are questions that only Tom can answer.
3726687	eng	Tom put a CD in the CD player.
3726688	eng	Tom is a team player.
3726689	eng	Don't ever tell me I'm not a team player.
3726690	eng	You're a real team player.
3726691	eng	Tom hasn't got a prayer.
3726692	eng	Tom shoved his wet clothes into the dryer.
3726693	eng	That's why I need a lawyer.
3726694	eng	My husband was a lawyer.
3726695	eng	Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
3726696	eng	Tom was supposed to be our lawyer.
3726697	eng	You could be a great lawyer.
3726698	eng	Change is in the air.
3726699	eng	I'm glad we had this chance to clear the air.
3726700	eng	I just wanted some air.
3726701	eng	I don't think it would be fair.
3726702	eng	I believe I have been more than fair.
3726703	eng	I have long blonde hair.
3726704	eng	I've got sand in my hair.
3726705	eng	Tom was slouched in a chair.
3726706	eng	Tom settled himself in a chair.
3726707	eng	Tom pulled up a chair.
3726708	eng	Tom fell asleep sitting up in the chair.
3726709	eng	Tom pushed Mary into the chair.
3726710	eng	Tom is strapped into a high chair.
3726711	eng	Tom slumped in his chair.
3726712	eng	Tom fidgeted in his chair.
3726713	eng	Tom rocked back and forth in his chair.
3726714	eng	Tom collapsed into his chair.
3726715	eng	It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
3726716	eng	Your table is ready, sir.
3726717	eng	Tom didn't stir.
3726718	eng	Don't risk everything you've worked for.
3726719	eng	I went to get the file you asked for.
3726720	eng	Tom is still going through the files, looking for the information you asked for.
3726721	eng	I suppose an explanation is called for.
3726722	eng	It's everything we could've hoped for.
3726723	eng	It's more than we could have hoped for.
3726724	eng	Tom wants his mother properly cared for.
3726725	eng	I'll buy Tom that pony he's always bugging me for.
3726726	eng	I'll get what I came for.
3726727	eng	I've been doing what we came for.
3726728	eng	You have so much to live for.
3726729	eng	You have plenty of things to live for.
3726730	eng	I'm not sure I have the answers you're looking for.
3726731	eng	This isn't what I'm looking for.
3726732	eng	I'm not worth dying for.
3726733	eng	That's one question Tom doesn't have an answer for.
3726734	eng	Tom has a lot to answer for.
3726735	eng	I hate everything Tom stands for.
3726736	eng	This is the job Tom pays us for.
3726737	eng	It's not Tom you have to watch out for.
3726738	eng	Tom is embarrassed by his son's behavior.
3726739	eng	I regret my recent behavior.
3726740	eng	I don't need a counselor.
3726741	eng	I don't want to talk to a counselor.
3726742	eng	Tom was a sailor.
3726743	eng	You didn't tell me Tom had a sense of humor.
3726744	eng	I can neither confirm or deny that rumor.
3726745	eng	It was an honor.
3726746	eng	Tom has talked about running for governor.
3726747	eng	Tom angrily rattled the locked door.
3726748	eng	Tom slipped out the side door.
3726749	eng	Tom stepped into his office and closed the door.
3726750	eng	Tom nodded toward the door.
3726751	eng	Tom came through the door.
3726752	eng	Tom emerged from the door.
3726753	eng	Tom backed away from the door.
3726754	eng	I need you to open the door.
3726755	eng	Tom nodded and headed for the door.
3726756	eng	Tom turned and headed for the door.
3726757	eng	Tom appeared at the door.
3726758	eng	Tom ducked out the door.
3726759	eng	Tom stumbled out the door.
3726760	eng	Tom opened the truck door.
3726761	eng	Tom arrived at Mary's house and let himself in the kitchen door.
3726762	eng	Tom wheeled his bike out the front door.
3726763	eng	I awoke on the floor.
3726764	eng	Tom is slouched down on the floor.
3726765	eng	I want you to lie down face down on the floor.
3726766	eng	Tom was on the floor.
3726767	eng	Get on the floor.
3726768	eng	Tom was knocked to the floor.
3726769	eng	Tom walked across the floor.
3726770	eng	I can feel Tom's terror.
3726771	eng	Tom was combing his hair in front of a mirror.
3726772	eng	Tom undressed in front of the mirror.
3726773	eng	How do you look at yourself in the mirror?
3726774	eng	You deserve to be supervisor.
3726775	eng	I've already picked my successor.
3726776	eng	Blame your predecessor.
3726777	eng	You really are quite a skillful investigator.
3726778	eng	You're one savvy negotiator.
3726779	eng	Get me a defibrillator.
3726780	eng	Tom lacks the talent to be an actor.
3726781	eng	I guess we're going to need a doctor.
3726782	eng	I know where to find a good doctor.
3726783	eng	Get me another doctor.
3726784	eng	Tom is a parasailing instructor.
3726785	eng	Tom practically accused me of being a traitor.
3726786	eng	Tom has a visitor.
3726787	eng	We were returning a favor.
3726788	eng	I do owe Tom a favor.
3726789	eng	Just do me one last favor.
3726790	eng	I want to show it to Tom within the hour.
3726791	eng	I've arranged for your arraignment in one hour.
3726792	eng	You've got one hour.
3726793	eng	We've been sitting here for over an hour.
3726794	eng	Tom makes three hundred dollars an hour.
3726795	eng	You'll have it in about an hour.
3726796	eng	I assumed you'd be up at this hour.
3726797	eng	I thought I'd make a little detour.
3726798	eng	I can't tell if any of the cars are Tom's.
3726799	eng	The choice was Tom's.
3726800	eng	You're in the early stages of Alzheimer's.
3726801	eng	I have several ideas.
3726802	eng	Tom has the oddest ideas.
3726803	eng	It's a simple matter for me to reconnect the gas.
3726804	eng	Fruit gives me gas.
3726805	eng	I need to be with my kids for Christmas.
3726806	eng	I had no way of knowing where Tom was.
3726807	eng	I'll show you exactly where Tom was.
3726808	eng	I couldn't tell you who that was.
3726809	eng	I want everything put back where it was.
3726810	eng	I wish I knew for certain what it was.
3726811	eng	That's not how it was.
3726812	eng	That's just how it was.
3726813	eng	I can't go back to the way it was.
3726814	eng	They'll find us jobs.
3726815	eng	Tom changed his tactics.
3726816	eng	There's still a price on our heads.
3726817	eng	There's a price on our heads.
3726818	eng	I don't have any job leads.
3726819	eng	We need to improve the odds.
3726820	eng	I finally beat the odds.
3726821	eng	You said to give Tom what he needs.
3726822	eng	I'm trying to be sensitive to your needs.
3726823	eng	We both have urgent needs.
3726824	eng	Tom is coming over to help with the kids.
3726825	eng	I'm remembering when we were kids.
3726826	eng	I've had it up to here with those kids.

3726828	eng	Stop gossiping about my kids.
3726829	eng	My whole life's in your hands.

3726964	eng	Let Tom fight his own battles.
3726965	eng	I fight my own battles.
3726966	eng	It's not like we made up the rules.
3726967	eng	We were playing by the rules.
3726968	eng	Tom isn't playing by the rules.
3726969	eng	Tom likes to play mind games.
3726970	eng	Look, Tom, I'm tired of playing games.
3726971	eng	Quit playing games.
3726972	eng	I'm not in the mood for games.
3726973	eng	I can name names.
3726974	eng	I need their names.
3726975	eng	Tom called the office three times.
3726976	eng	Get with the times.
3726977	eng	Tom has done it enough times.
3726978	eng	We've had this conversation a million times.
3726979	eng	Tom can be trying at times.
3726980	eng	Tom nodded his head a few times.
3726981	eng	I guess this has happened a few times.
3726982	eng	I do pray sometimes.
3726983	eng	They planted bombs outside our homes.
3726984	eng	Fire up the engines.
3726985	eng	I feel it in my bones.
3726986	eng	If you don't know, maybe Tom does.
3726987	eng	Tell me what your father does.
3726988	eng	Tom looks like he always does.
3726989	eng	Let's see what it does.
3726990	eng	I guess that's just the way it goes.
3726991	eng	You're going to need better shoes.
3726992	eng	I didn't spit on your shoes.
3726993	eng	Tom used to shine my shoes.
3726994	eng	Tom is going to show me the ropes.
3726995	eng	It's not like anybody cares.
3726996	eng	The plan is to buy half a million dollars worth of shares.
3726997	eng	That's going to give me nightmares.
3726998	eng	I won't have Tom doing your chores.
3726999	eng	I'm going to show you some pictures.
3727000	eng	You can't even tell it's me in those pictures.
3727001	eng	Tom has helped the police with several major cases.
3727002	eng	I'm sure they'll come to their senses.
3727003	eng	I'm glad to see you've come to your senses.
3727004	eng	You'll probably be swamped with responses.
3727005	eng	Now hurry up and get ready. I want to get to the store before it closes.
3727006	eng	Tom, hold your horses.
3727007	eng	Neither one of us rides horses.
3727008	eng	I take a few night courses.
3727009	eng	Tom is wearing an expensive pair of glasses.
3727010	eng	Tom smothered his daughter with kisses.
3727011	eng	I'm done making excuses.
3727012	eng	We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.
3727013	eng	Tom is on good terms with his classmates.
3727014	eng	Tom neither reads nor writes.
3727015	eng	It'll just take three minutes.
3727016	eng	We're giving you about ten minutes.
3727017	eng	I'll catch up with you in a few minutes.
3727018	eng	I'm sure it can wait a few minutes.
3727019	eng	I need everybody in the conference room in thirty minutes.
3727020	eng	Patience isn't one of my virtues.
3727021	eng	You're digging your own graves.
3727022	eng	We're here to save lives.
3727023	eng	It saved our lives.
3727024	eng	All we can do now is go on with our lives.
3727025	eng	Tom and I owe you our lives.
3727026	eng	Hold on for your lives.
3727027	eng	Tom is an expert at throwing knives.
3727028	eng	I appreciate your motives.
3727029	eng	We have a right to defend ourselves.
3727030	eng	We wish to improve ourselves.
3727031	eng	Tom wants us to improve ourselves.
3727032	eng	I think we should be proud of ourselves.
3727033	eng	Let's not lie to ourselves.
3727034	eng	I knew we had to fend for ourselves.
3727035	eng	We feel really good about ourselves.
3727036	eng	I hope you're proud of yourselves.
3727037	eng	I always thought Tom was raised by wolves.
3727038	eng	Tom pulled on a pair of rubber gloves.
3727039	eng	Tom began to remove his gloves.
3727040	eng	Shoot anything that moves.
3727041	eng	I think a glass of wine would help me calm my nerves.
3727042	eng	I paid my taxes.
3727043	eng	Tom is carefully stacking the boxes.
3727044	eng	Tom is in his office, packing books into boxes.
3727045	eng	Tom never did like long goodbyes.
3727046	eng	The time has come for goodbyes.
3727047	eng	I'm not that good at goodbyes.
3727048	eng	Tom looked Mary in the eyes.
3727049	eng	I saw the look of terror in Tom's eyes.
3727050	eng	Tom signaled Mary with his eyes.
3727051	eng	Tom undressed Mary with his eyes.
3727052	eng	Look at those legs.
3727053	eng	You have great legs.
3727054	eng	I just thought I'd stretch my legs.
3727055	eng	Tom made a great deal of money working on oil rigs.
3727056	eng	That's what happens when drivers do stupid things.
3727057	eng	I can use all these things.
3727058	eng	I know you've become more open-minded about these things.
3727059	eng	You can still do those things.
3727060	eng	Let's look at the positive side of things.
3727061	eng	We're not interested in such things.
3727062	eng	I'm sorry we have to ask you such things.
3727063	eng	Perhaps you overthink things.
3727064	eng	I'm fairly good with mechanical things.
3727065	eng	I know you've seen some awful things.
3727066	eng	You have to be very careful not to overdo things.
3727067	eng	You say the sweetest things.
3727068	eng	You should trust me when I tell you things.
3727069	eng	You revealed your feelings.
3727070	eng	Don't be ashamed of your feelings.
3727071	eng	I know about your feelings.
3727072	eng	Tom is in touch with his feelings.
3727073	eng	Give me a minute to get my bearings.
3727074	eng	I've completely lost my bearings.
3727075	eng	I've been waiting in the wings.
3727076	eng	Tom's not doing that many drugs.
3727077	eng	We were together for about three months.
3727078	eng	We were only together a few months.
3727079	eng	I have to find out what that music is.
3727080	eng	I can't imagine what the trouble is.
3727081	eng	I can't even remember what my name is.
3727082	eng	We should find out when Tom's funeral is.
3727083	eng	Tom knows all too well what the problem is.
3727084	eng	I've been where Tom is.
3727085	eng	I forgot how sensitive Tom is.
3727086	eng	I'm just curious what your plan is.
3727087	eng	I don't know what your situation is.
3727088	eng	We'll go wherever the action is.
3727089	eng	I have to know who my father is.
3727090	eng	I don't believe I know where that is.
3727091	eng	I'm afraid to ask what that is.
3727092	eng	You must tell me who it is.
3727093	eng	We're on pretty shaky ground as it is.
3727094	eng	I'm just telling you how it is.
3727095	eng	Now I'm going to tell you how it is.
3727096	eng	I'm afraid that's just the way it is.
3727097	eng	I guess that's just the way it is.
3727098	eng	You have no idea how expensive having a baby is.
3727099	eng	It looks a lot worse than it really is.
3727100	eng	Look, I need this.
3727101	eng	Nobody could've planned this.
3727102	eng	I couldn't have planned this.
3727103	eng	Tom hadn't really expected this.
3727104	eng	Tom is going to think I was behind this.
3727105	eng	I can't believe you just made this.
3727106	eng	Wait'll you see this.
3727107	eng	They won't all be like this.
3727108	eng	I don't know why I'm acting like this.
3727109	eng	I'm sorry to barge in like this.
3727110	eng	I don't like you going off on your own like this.
3727111	eng	It's like this.
3727112	eng	I've always been lucky with things like this.
3727113	eng	I've never had a night like this.
3727114	eng	You just can't put a price on a moment like this.
3727115	eng	I don't like you like this.
3727116	eng	I didn't mean to deceive you like this.
3727117	eng	I'm not used to seeing you like this.
3727118	eng	I'm not usually like this.
3727119	eng	I can settle this.
3727120	eng	Tom would've never done this.
3727121	eng	I don't wish to debate this.
3727122	eng	Tom doesn't deserve this.
3727123	eng	Get a load of this.
3727124	eng	Please don't breathe a word of this.
3727125	eng	I don't know quite what to make of this.
3727126	eng	I can't believe Tom could be capable of this.
3727127	eng	Tom has had about enough of this.
3727128	eng	I don't like the look of this.
3727129	eng	You started all of this.
3727130	eng	I'm completely cool about all of this.
3727131	eng	I'm so sorry about all of this.
3727132	eng	Get a shot of this.
3727133	eng	I'm not going to be a part of this.
3727134	eng	You should've stayed out of this.
3727135	eng	Keep me out of this.
3727136	eng	I would just as soon not make a big deal out of this.
3727137	eng	Let's not make a big deal out of this.
3727138	eng	I can get us out of this.
3727139	eng	I know Tom will get out of this.
3727140	eng	You can get out of this.
3727141	eng	I haven't agreed to any of this.
3727142	eng	I'm watching this.
3727143	eng	I'm starting to get a bad feeling this.
3727144	eng	You're the one doing this.
3727145	eng	I could make a fortune doing this.
3727146	eng	I don't see any reason for doing this.
3727147	eng	I'm not comfortable discussing this.
3727148	eng	I'm using this.
3727149	eng	I assume you'll be investigating this.
3727150	eng	Tom looks like he was half expecting this.
3727151	eng	I can't believe you're saying this.
3727152	eng	I can't believe I'm saying this.
3727153	eng	I don't think I can get through this.
3727154	eng	I don't know how we're going to get through this.
3727155	eng	I shouldn't have put you through this.
3727156	eng	It's going to take me days to finish this.
3727157	eng	You shouldn't get involved with this.
3727158	eng	I'm so sorry to get you involved with this.
3727159	eng	Tom said you had some experience with this.
3727160	eng	Tom still isn't entirely comfortable with this.
3727161	eng	I assume you're going somewhere with this.
3727162	eng	I'm still not sure where you're going with this.
3727163	eng	I never should've gone along with this.
3727164	eng	I hope you guys are cool with this.
3727165	eng	They're having fun with this.
3727166	eng	We've got nothing to do with this.
3727167	eng	I hope we get away with this.
3727168	eng	You can't get away with this.
3727169	eng	I know you can't get away with this.
3727171	eng	You'll hardly feel this.
3727172	eng	I should've known you were behind all this.
3727173	eng	Tom doesn't know what to make of all this.
3727174	eng	Tom has had enough of all this.
3727175	eng	Something good will come from all this.
3727176	eng	I'll never remember all this.
3727177	eng	Wow, look at all this.
3727178	eng	Sorry about all this.
3727179	eng	I don't know why I'm telling you all this.
3727180	eng	Tom seems genuinely disturbed by all this.
3727181	eng	I can't walk away from this.
3727182	eng	I deserve to be treated better than this.
3727183	eng	You know better than this.
3727184	eng	I can't be involved in this.
3727185	eng	I have no choice in this.
3727186	eng	I don't take any pleasure in this.
3727187	eng	We're together in this.
3727188	eng	I've completely lost interest in this.
3727189	eng	You don't get a say in this.
3727190	eng	I'm not sure I can win this.
3727191	eng	Let's bring Tom up to speed on this.
3727192	eng	Tom hadn't counted on this.
3727193	eng	I have a lot riding on this.
3727194	eng	Let's be clear on this.
3727195	eng	Put your finger on this.
3727196	eng	Tom might be able to shed some light on this.
3727197	eng	I need you on this.
3727198	eng	I'm sorry you drew the short straw on this.
3727199	eng	We can all do this.
3727200	eng	I used to not be able to do this.
3727201	eng	Tom is unable to do this.
3727202	eng	You're going to do this.
3727203	eng	I don't know why we're bothering to do this.
3727204	eng	I know how much you want to do this.
3727205	eng	Tom said it wasn't smart to do this.
3727206	eng	We were hoping you could tell us how to do this.
3727207	eng	Look, I can't do this.
3727208	eng	Let's just do this.
3727209	eng	You can't just do this.
3727210	eng	I don't want to get used to this.
3727211	eng	Tom is definitely not looking forward to this.
3727212	eng	I never thought it would come to this.
3727213	eng	I never wanted it to come to this.
3727214	eng	There's nothing to this.
3727215	eng	I'm going to put a stop to this.
3727216	eng	I won't be pushed into this.
3727217	eng	I won't get sucked into this.
3727218	eng	I can't believe I got roped into this.
3727219	eng	You forced me into this.
3727220	eng	I thought you were into this.
3727221	eng	I won't drag Tom into this.
3727222	eng	I really don't want to get into this.
3727223	eng	I never should've dragged you into this.
3727224	eng	I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
3727225	eng	I never should've got you into this.
3727226	eng	I'm the one who got you into this.
3727227	eng	Nobody needs to lose their job over this.
3727228	eng	I've thought long and hard over this.
3727229	eng	I don't know why you're making such a fuss over this.
3727230	eng	It's not like I haven't been trained for this.
3727231	eng	I'm not completely prepared for this.
3727232	eng	I'll hold you responsible for this.
3727233	eng	I paid a fortune for this.
3727234	eng	I don't think I'm drunk enough for this.
3727235	eng	I didn't look for this.
3727236	eng	You could go to jail for this.
3727237	eng	Hey, I didn't sign on for this.
3727238	eng	I dropped everything and grabbed the first plane out of Boston for this.
3727239	eng	I've been waiting like a year for this.
3727240	eng	I might not be cut out for this.
3727241	eng	No offense, Tom, but you're not ready for this.
3727242	eng	You're really amazing at this.
3727243	eng	You have to get past this.
3727244	eng	You've been warned about this.
3727245	eng	I feel really good about this.
3727246	eng	I don't feel very good about this.
3727247	eng	Tell me you're sure about this.
3727248	eng	I honestly didn't know a thing about this.
3727249	eng	I'm scared to death about this.
3727250	eng	I got a call about this.
3727251	eng	I'm really fired up about this.
3727252	eng	Look, Tom, nobody needs to know about this.
3727253	eng	We'll see what Tom has to say about this.
3727254	eng	I'm so sorry about this.
3727255	eng	That's not why I'm telling you this.
3727256	eng	I don't know how to tell you this.
3727257	eng	That's why I got you this.
3727258	eng	I never thought I'd say this.
3727259	eng	I don't know quite how to say this.
3727260	eng	I don't quite know how to say this.
3727261	eng	I can't be distracted by this.
3727262	eng	If you want allergy relief, try this.
3727263	eng	That's on a need-to-know basis.
3727264	eng	I'm afraid I have to agree with Tom's analysis.

3727335	eng	I know they've got big problems.
3727336	eng	I'm having some legal problems.
3727337	eng	Let's not argue about that now. We've got bigger problems.
3727338	eng	People trust me to solve their problems.
3727339	eng	Right now, that's the least of our problems.
3727340	eng	Tell me your problems.
3727341	eng	We just had a few problems.
3727342	eng	Be good and don't cause me any problems.
3727343	eng	They're in separate rooms.
3727344	eng	Tom disappeared into one of the other rooms.
3727345	eng	Tom and Mary fell into each other's arms.
3727346	eng	Tom is asleep in Mary's arms.
3727347	eng	I can barely move my arms.
3727348	eng	We're prepared to meet to discuss your terms.
3727349	eng	We're not on particularly friendly terms.
3727350	eng	I have all your albums.
3727351	eng	Tom heard the drums.
3727352	eng	They'll know what that means.
3727354	eng	I'm still studying the plans.
3727355	eng	It's a tempting offer, but I have other plans.
3727356	eng	We should notify Tom of our plans.
3727357	eng	I don't care about Tom's plans.
3727358	eng	Tom placed his hand over the lens.
3727359	eng	Every time we go anywhere, something awful happens.
3727360	eng	It happens when it happens.
3727361	eng	They say that's the way it happens.
3727362	eng	I know all the signs.
3727363	eng	Tom survived three days in the mountains.
3727364	eng	Tom walked over to the window and opened the curtains.
3727365	eng	I've got varicose veins.
3727366	eng	They were cousins.
3727367	eng	I've had my suspicions.
3727368	eng	Don't make any rash decisions.
3727369	eng	I see you made a few modifications.
3727370	eng	I've severed communications.
3727371	eng	I'm looking for reasonably-priced accommodations.
3727372	eng	May I be the first to offer my congratulations.
3727373	eng	Congratulations on passing all your examinations.
3727374	eng	We'd better make preparations.
3727375	eng	I don't respond to accusations.
3727376	eng	Tom has lived up to our expectations.
3727377	eng	We all earn our reputations.
3727378	eng	Tom is used to these sorts of situations.
3727379	eng	Tom has to take responsibility for his own actions.
3727380	eng	I accept full responsibility for their actions.
3727381	eng	Stand by for instructions.
3727382	eng	I'm carrying on the family's traditions.
3727383	eng	Maybe they don't want to give away their positions.
3727384	eng	Tom is looking around for options.
3727385	eng	You should learn not to limit your options.
3727386	eng	We have a few questions concerning Tom's options.
3727387	eng	Tom seems to be weighing his options.
3727388	eng	We value your suggestions.
3727389	eng	Tom kindly answered questions.
3727390	eng	Tom was always able to answer all the questions.
3727391	eng	Tom is smart enough to answer all the questions.
3727392	eng	I thought we'd ask Tom a couple questions.
3727393	eng	I'm asking myself a lot of the same questions.
3727394	eng	I'm going to ask you a series of questions.
3727395	eng	Tom is apt to get angry if you ask him a lot of questions.
3727396	eng	We're not taking questions.
3727397	eng	I'm just a guy asking questions.
3727398	eng	I was hoping that you'd answer a few questions.
3727399	eng	I really don't have any questions.
3727400	eng	I think that's all, unless you have any questions.
3727401	eng	I have so many questions.
3727402	eng	Tom has spent most of his life in and out of mental institutions.
3727403	eng	I work afternoons.
3727404	eng	I have no weapons.
3727405	eng	We have more immediate concerns.
3727406	eng	Tell your men to drop their guns.
3727407	eng	We're playing for keeps.
3727408	eng	Tom appeared on the steps.
3727409	eng	Tom dashed up the steps.
3727410	eng	Watch out for the steps.
3727411	eng	Tom kissed Mary passionately on the lips.
3727412	eng	Tom kissed Mary softly on the lips.
3727413	eng	Tom put a finger to his lips.
3727414	eng	Tom licked his dry lips.
3727415	eng	I already talked to the cops.
3727416	eng	I've already told this to the cops.
3727417	eng	Tell it to the cops.
3727418	eng	Tom looked through the bars.
3727419	eng	I've always been into cars.
3727420	eng	Tom doesn't like anyone looking at his scars.
3727421	eng	They are all ears.
3727422	eng	Tom couldn't fight back the tears.
3727423	eng	Tom couldn't stop the tears.
3727424	eng	Tom was almost in tears.
3727425	eng	Tom was close to tears.
3727426	eng	I've done more work on my farm in the last three months than you've done in three years.
3727427	eng	They were together three years.
3727428	eng	Tom served as chairman for three years.
3727429	eng	Tom has been on the wanted list for three years.
3727430	eng	Tom has been on the waiting list for three years.
3727431	eng	We were together about three years.
3727432	eng	That could take years.
3727433	eng	It might take years.
3727434	eng	Tom has kept it a secret for all of these years.
3727435	eng	Tom is certainly getting along in years.
3727436	eng	Tom hadn't talked to them in years.
3727437	eng	Tom hasn't filed a tax return in years.
3727438	eng	Tom has been after me to retire for years.
3727439	eng	I've been waiting for this moment for years.
3727440	eng	Tom is wise beyond his years.
3727441	eng	The price of bananas hasn't changed much over the past few years.
3727442	eng	It may take many years.
3727443	eng	I've admired you for many years.
3727444	eng	Tom has been on TV every night for thirty years.
3727445	eng	They were beggars.
3727446	eng	Tom and Mary are both horrible liars.
3727447	eng	I don't have a hundred dollars.
3727448	eng	Tom sold a pint of his blood for thirteen dollars.
3727449	eng	Tom is suing the city for 3 million dollars.
3727450	eng	I didn't press Tom for particulars.
3727451	eng	People die in wars.
3727452	eng	I've gone over the numbers.
3727453	eng	I need to crunch some numbers.
3727454	eng	Tom is massaging Mary's shoulders.
3727455	eng	Tom has no right to give me orders.
3727456	eng	I'm under orders.
3727457	eng	You should've followed Tom's orders.
3727458	eng	I had my orders.
3727459	eng	I already have my orders.
3727460	eng	We're investigating a series of murders.
3727461	eng	We would like some more beers.
3727462	eng	You of all people should know the dangers.
3727463	eng	It's not like we're strangers.
3727464	eng	Tom is terrified of talking to strangers.
3727465	eng	I can't talk to strangers.
3727466	eng	I have two arms and ten fingers.
3727467	eng	Tom drummed with his fingers.
3727468	eng	Tom ticks off points on his fingers.
3727469	eng	We could all be better teachers.
3727470	eng	Tom glanced at the others.
3727471	eng	Tom and Mary have the same father but different mothers.
3727472	eng	My sons are soldiers.
3727473	eng	Tom picked up a package of crackers.
3727474	eng	I don't pick up hitchhikers.
3727475	eng	I talked to Tom's neighbors and co-workers.
3727476	eng	They were contract killers.
3727477	eng	Tom and Mary were good customers.
3727478	eng	I can't have you hitting the customers.
3727479	eng	You took me to the cleaners.
3727480	eng	It's just good manners.
3727481	eng	I thought we were equal partners.
3727482	eng	I'd like to know who leaked the story to the papers.
3727483	eng	We aren't the murderers.
3727484	eng	They are surrounded by admirers.
3727485	eng	I suggest you return to your quarters.
3727486	eng	I'll take you to your quarters.
3727487	eng	Tom will show you to your quarters.
3727488	eng	Tom must remain in his quarters.
3727489	eng	Please escort Tom to his quarters.
3727490	eng	I should get back to my quarters.
3727491	eng	They were deserters.
3727492	eng	Tom and Mary are problem solvers.
3727493	eng	Now, Tom, you can't expect me to give you all the answers.
3727494	eng	You always seem to know all the answers.
3727495	eng	I'm seeking answers.
3727496	eng	I just want answers.
3727497	eng	I'd like to pay for the repairs.
3727498	eng	They are now at the top of the stairs.
3727499	eng	Tom charged down the stairs.
3727500	eng	Tom walked down a flight of stairs.
3727501	eng	They walked downstairs.
3727502	eng	Tom never even came upstairs.
3727503	eng	Tom shut the door and went upstairs.
3727504	eng	I need you upstairs.
3727505	eng	I'll have to clear this with my superiors.
3727506	eng	Tom is meeting with economic advisors.
3727507	eng	Tom Jackson is one of our finest litigators.
3727508	eng	Tom does me a lot of favors.
3727509	eng	Tom has been at it for three hours.
3727510	eng	Tom has been staring at Mary for three hours.
3727511	eng	That'd take hours.
3727512	eng	You've been at this for hours.
3727513	eng	You've been at it for hours.
3727514	eng	I'll check back with you in a few hours.
3727515	eng	The decision must be yours.
3727516	eng	I'll tell you my life's story if you tell me yours.
3727517	eng	I'm a huge fan of yours.
3727518	eng	I'm guessing it's yours.
3727519	eng	The decision is yours.
3727520	eng	I'm guessing this is yours.
3727521	eng	The victory is yours.
3727522	eng	Tom is always spacing out in class.
3727523	eng	Tom left school right after class.
3727524	eng	I wanted to say how much I enjoyed your class.
3727525	eng	I don't want to fall behind my class.
3727526	eng	Tom's face is reflected in the glass.
3727527	eng	Tom set down his glass.
3727528	eng	Tom held out his glass.
3727529	eng	Tom toyed with his empty glass.
3727530	eng	I think I'm going to pass.
3727531	eng	They were sitting on the grass.
3727532	eng	I would like to request a short recess.
3727533	eng	I've been familiarizing myself with the process.
3727534	eng	I've got nothing to confess.
3727535	eng	Tom couldn't care less.
3727536	eng	I won't settle for anything less.
3727537	eng	I've never seen anyone enjoy Boston less.
3727538	eng	It's very rare and priceless.
3727539	eng	This may be hopeless.
3727540	eng	I don't remember you being careless.
3727541	eng	We'll be totally defenseless.
3727542	eng	You guys are really clueless.
3727543	eng	Tom was ruthless.
3727544	eng	It may be quite harmless.
3727545	eng	Tom is quite helpless.
3727546	eng	I'm sure you feel helpless.
3727547	eng	Tom thinks his job is pointless.
3727548	eng	The floor is spotless.
3727549	eng	You look a mess.
3727550	eng	I'll bet the inside of the house is a mess.
3727551	eng	I've had enough of this mess.
3727552	eng	It's a legitimate business.
3727553	eng	That new chain store could put me out of business.
3727554	eng	Tom took over his father's business.
3727555	eng	Tom is in the frozen yogurt business.
3727556	eng	Tom is suffering from a serious illness.
3727557	eng	Tom is on the verge of losing consciousness.
3727558	eng	Tom seems to have lost consciousness.
3727559	eng	You're an unreliable witness.
3727560	eng	Text me the address.
3727561	eng	I think maybe you've got the wrong address.
3727562	eng	Tom began to undress.
3727563	eng	Tom is making real progress.
3727564	eng	I'd like to report a felony in progress.
3727565	eng	I'm impressed by your progress.
3727566	eng	You have to talk to the press.
3727567	eng	Tom is under considerable stress.
3727568	eng	I couldn't live with that kind of stress.
3727569	eng	I've been under a lot of stress.
3727570	eng	Tom is under a lot of stress.
3727571	eng	I don't perform well under stress.
3727572	eng	I could've tried harder, I guess.
3727573	eng	That was my second guess.
3727574	eng	That's your guess.
3727575	eng	That was my first guess.
3727576	eng	That was my guess.
3727577	eng	It's never just a kiss.
3727578	eng	They gave each other a quick kiss.
3727579	eng	Tom gave Mary a perfunctory kiss.
3727580	eng	It's not something I can miss.
3727581	eng	I need to meet your boss.
3727582	eng	Tom has complete faith in his boss.
3727583	eng	Tom anonymously donated a large sum of money to the Red Cross.
3727584	eng	Tom must've been suspicious.
3727585	eng	I don't have to make threats.
3727586	eng	I don't care about boats.
3727587	eng	You've got to face the facts.
3727588	eng	It doesn't change the facts.
3727589	eng	I knew my only chance was to trust my instincts.
3727590	eng	All you had to do was buy a couple of tickets.
3727591	eng	You know I'm not good with secrets.
3727592	eng	It's not easy sharing your secrets.
3727593	eng	I felt like a deer in the headlights.
3727594	eng	Tom looks like a deer caught in headlights.
3727595	eng	Tom waived his rights.
3727596	eng	It's a little late for second thoughts.
3727597	eng	Tom paused to collect his thoughts.
3727598	eng	I know now there are no limits.
3727599	eng	I have my limits.
3727600	eng	You said you wanted quick results.
3727601	eng	Tom tried to get rid of the ants.
3727602	eng	Tom was chosen from 300 applicants.
3727603	eng	I came by to water Tom's plants.
3727604	eng	Hold on to your pants.
3727605	eng	Pull up your pants.
3727606	eng	You're not wearing any pants.
3727607	eng	Tom has earned the right to say whatever he wants.
3727608	eng	I didn't want to alarm the students.
3727609	eng	I didn't want to disturb the patients.
3727610	eng	You have hidden talents.
3727611	eng	This is a waste of your time and your talents.
3727612	eng	They both gave statements.
3727613	eng	I assume you share Tom's sentiments.
3727614	eng	I thought we had commitments.
3727615	eng	The only problem is there's no one here who can translate these documents.
3727616	eng	They were loving, caring parents.
3727617	eng	I don't believe I know your parents.
3727618	eng	Tom dined with his parents.
3727619	eng	I inherited it from my parents.
3727620	eng	The rains came in torrents.
3727621	eng	Tom opened the bottle and sniffed its contents.
3727622	eng	Tom isn't the one calling the shots.
3727623	eng	I call the shots.
3727624	eng	Tom calls the shots.
3727625	eng	I'm getting some beautiful shots.
3727626	eng	They're all in cahoots.
3727627	eng	I'm the richest man in these parts.
3727628	eng	Tom seems out of sorts.
3727629	eng	I have an obligation to look out for Tom's interests.
3727630	eng	I just ran some tests.
3727631	eng	I can't afford any more tests.
3727632	eng	I don't need to run any tests.
3727633	eng	You're frightening the guests.
3727634	eng	We have a houseful of guests.
3727635	eng	Tom never did have much use for scientists.
3727636	eng	No such person exists.
3727637	eng	We have no evidence that such a virus exists.
3727638	eng	I don't think you have the guts.
3727639	eng	Tom has got to be completely nuts.
3727640	eng	Tom hasn't been responding to my texts.
3727641	eng	Tom isn't responding to my texts.
3727642	eng	I want to put all this behind us.
3727643	eng	Tom didn't have the courage to face us.
3727644	eng	Tom didn't seem exactly overjoyed to see us.
3727645	eng	Tom is sure to come to see us.
3727646	eng	Someone's been here before us.
3727647	eng	Somebody got there before us.
3727648	eng	Tom was going to expose us.
3727649	eng	I think they're trying to intimidate us.
3727650	eng	I don't know if Tom likes us, but he doesn't hate us.
3727651	eng	You may leave us.
3727652	eng	They're here to save us.
3727653	eng	Tom is making money off us.
3727654	eng	Tom has always managed to stay one step ahead of us.
3727655	eng	You're way ahead of us.
3727656	eng	It has to be one of us.
3727657	eng	We know you're one of us.
3727658	eng	You could've been one of us.
3727659	eng	I knew that guy wasn't one of us.
3727660	eng	Tom is always mooching off of us.
3727661	eng	We can work something out that's acceptable to both of us.
3727662	eng	If you were to leave Boston, it would be better for both of us.
3727663	eng	They will punish all of us.
3727664	eng	Tom is going to kill all of us.
3727665	eng	Tom means a lot to all of us.
3727666	eng	You had every right to make fun of us.
3727667	eng	There will be two of us.
3727668	eng	They're almost on top of us.
3727669	eng	Tom isn't going to just ditch us.
3727670	eng	You'll ride with us.
3727671	eng	Tom is toying with us.
3727672	eng	When we come back, we'll have Tom with us.
3727673	eng	You don't want anything to do with us.
3727674	eng	You were lucky to catch up with us.
3727675	eng	Come and fight with us.
3727676	eng	We were hoping you could tell us.
3727677	eng	I don't think Tom would try to kill us.
3727678	eng	They can't kill us.
3727679	eng	Nothing like that ever happened between us.
3727680	eng	There will be no more secrets between us.
3727681	eng	There won't be any more secrets between us.

3727691	eng	They'll come to us.
3727692	eng	You have nothing to prove to us.
3727693	eng	Tom is a bit of a mystery to us.

3727695	eng	Tom is doing everything he can to stop us.
3727696	eng	They're coming after us.

3727715	rus	Это не змея. Это всего лишь кусок верёвки.
3727716	deu	Ich sehe nicht recht, inwiefern uns das helfen wird.
3727717	deu	Tom ist uns ein bisschen ein Rätsel.
3727718	deu	Du musst uns nichts beweisen.
3727719	deu	Einer von ihnen hat sogar zu uns gesprochen.
3727720	deu	Sie werden uns nicht aufgeben.
3727721	tur	Tom bana bir duş aldırdı.
3727722	deu	Sie kommen uns immer näher.
3727723	eng	The perfume bottle has a blue cap.
3727724	deu	Tom holt uns immer mehr ein.
3727725	deu	Sie holen uns ein.
3727726	heb	יש לך את הכסף?
3727727	deu	Sie sind auf uns losgegangen.
3727728	heb	אתה הוא מחבר הספר הזה?
3727729	cbk	Favor cerrá cunel ventana.
3727730	heb	אתה ספורטיבי?
3727731	heb	היא לא מדברת יפנית בבית.
3727732	cbk	Siembrá mga ponô!
3727733	hun	El voltál foglalva.
3727734	deu	Tom schnorrt uns immer an.
3727735	heb	הרהיטים במשרד זה מאוד מודרניים.
3727736	hun	Teljesen be vagyunk rúgva.

3727743	heb	אני אוהבת חמאה יותר מאשר גבינה.
3727744	eng	Tom set up a meeting for us.
3727745	eng	Tom has done well for us.
3727746	eng	Tom has more than enough room for us.
3727747	eng	They left that for us.
3727748	eng	I hope you're going to support us.
3727749	eng	No one's getting past us.
3727750	eng	You're either with us or you're against us.
3727751	eng	This isn't about Tom. This is about us.
3727752	eng	This isn't about us.
3727753	eng	I think they went without us.
3727754	eng	This is what Tom was trying to show us.
3727755	eng	Tom is able to destroy us.
3727756	eng	I have to stay with the bus.
3727757	eng	Tom can barely focus.
3727758	eng	It didn't take a genius to figure it out.
3727759	eng	It looks hideous.
3727760	eng	Tom was amazingly courageous.
3727761	eng	I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
3727762	eng	I can be courteous.
3727763	eng	Tom was dubious.
3727764	eng	The room was fairly spacious.
3727765	eng	I don't see anything remotely suspicious.
3727766	eng	Tom became conscious.
3727767	eng	Tom is lying on the floor, unconscious.
3727768	eng	You're extremely ingenious.
3727769	eng	You think we're serious.
3727770	eng	They're kind of serious.
3727771	eng	Look, I'm serious.
3727772	eng	It's deadly serious.
3727773	eng	You're so very serious.
3727774	eng	That should be obvious.
3727775	eng	It seemed fairly obvious.
3727776	eng	Tom will be getting anxious.
3727777	eng	Tom never used to be so obnoxious.
3727778	eng	Tom will be so jealous.
3727779	eng	Tom was incredulous.
3727780	eng	Tom is delusional and dangerous.
3727781	eng	That'd be dangerous.
3727782	eng	Tom seems to be dangerous.
3727783	eng	It's becoming too dangerous.
3727784	eng	It's far too dangerous.
3727785	eng	It's way too dangerous.
3727786	eng	It's just way too dangerous.
3727787	eng	It was incredibly dangerous.
3727788	eng	It's said to be very dangerous.
3727789	eng	I think that's more than generous.
3727790	eng	I think that's really generous.
3727791	eng	The climb was strenuous.
3727792	eng	It's a little presumptuous.
3727793	eng	There's no point in being nervous.
3727794	eng	Outsiders make Tom nervous.
3727795	eng	Well, I didn't want to make you nervous.
3727796	eng	Listen, I got some bad news.
3727797	eng	I can cope with bad news.
3727798	eng	It's bad news.
3727799	eng	I just received some very bad news.
3727800	eng	That can't be the good news.
3727801	eng	I've just received some good news.
3727802	eng	Tell me the news.
3727803	eng	Tom was crushed by the news.
3727804	eng	Tom delivered the horrible news.
3727805	eng	This is stunning news.
3727806	eng	I've just received some delightful news.
3727807	eng	I have marvelous news.
3727808	eng	I've just received some great news.
3727809	eng	Tom is boarding up the windows.
3727810	eng	Tom is luckier than he knows.
3727811	eng	I don't know how Tom knows.
3727812	eng	We aren't due to arrive for three days.
3727813	eng	I'll have it in a couple days.
3727814	eng	All I need is three more days.
3727815	eng	Tom wasn't too happy in those days.
3727816	eng	You've had a real hard time the last couple of days.
3727817	eng	You're out of vacation days.
3727818	eng	Tom has been lying for days.
3727819	eng	It went on for days.
3727820	eng	Tom went on a trip for a few days.
3727821	eng	We're only asking you to do it for a few days.
3727822	eng	That should give us another few days.
3727823	eng	Tom will say what he always says.
3727824	eng	Tom fumbled in his pocket for the keys.
3727825	eng	I realized I still had your keys.
3727826	eng	Tom fumbled with his keys.
3727827	eng	They sent me three turkeys.
3727828	eng	We don't stand a chance against those guys.
3727829	eng	I've had it up to here with you guys.
3727830	eng	Tom wants to give an answer, but of course, he can't.
3727831	eng	Tom started to say something, but didn't.
3727832	eng	I'd like to say it's been fun working here, but it hasn't.
3727833	eng	Tom was sneered at.
3727834	eng	I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
3727835	eng	Tom suddenly understood what Mary was getting at.
3727836	eng	I'm not sure what Tom is getting at.
3727837	eng	Tom shivered when he saw the black cat.
3727838	eng	We could all use something to eat.
3727839	eng	You can bring us all back something to eat.
3727840	eng	Tom was hoping to earn enough to buy something to eat.
3727841	eng	We've been waiting thirty minutes to eat.
3727842	eng	We're trying to find ourselves something decent to eat.
3727843	eng	In all the excitement, I forgot to eat.
3727844	eng	I'm not a deadbeat.
3727845	eng	Tom isn't about to admit defeat.
3727846	eng	That'd be great.
3727847	eng	I'm telling you this is going to be great.
3727848	eng	This is working great.
3727849	eng	Just relax, Tom, you're doing great.
3727850	eng	I think you've been doing great.
3727851	eng	The emotional price is too great.
3727852	eng	That must've felt so great.
3727853	eng	The chicken was great.
3727854	eng	Saving lives feels great.
3727855	eng	It feels great.
3727856	eng	It feels pretty great.
3727857	eng	I hope you've found a seat.
3727858	eng	Tom smiled as he took his seat.
3727859	eng	Tom leaped from his seat.
3727860	eng	Tom hopped in the front seat.
3727861	eng	Tom is in the copilot seat.
3727862	eng	Tom hopped in the backseat.
3727863	eng	Tom shoved Mary into the backseat.
3727864	eng	Tom is working up a sweat.
3727865	eng	I never would've guessed that.
3727866	eng	Tom approved that.
3727867	eng	I guess I deserved that.
3727868	eng	Somebody somewhere must've said that.
3727869	eng	I guess I just realized how stupid I would look if I did that.
3727870	eng	You'd make her the happiest woman on earth if you did that.
3727871	eng	You can work around that.
3727872	eng	It can't be that.
3727873	eng	Anyone could see that.
3727874	eng	I'm sorry you had to see that.
3727875	eng	I don't know how I didn't see that.
3727876	eng	I think we can manage that.
3727877	eng	I don't know how we're going to manage that.
3727878	eng	I can arrange that.
3727879	eng	I can't make a guarantee like that.
3727880	eng	Tom, you don't have to talk to me like that.
3727881	eng	Tom doesn't usually talk to me like that.
3727882	eng	Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that.
3727883	eng	Don't you start talking like that.
3727884	eng	You know I can't answer a question like that.
3727885	eng	I wish I could drop off to sleep like that.
3727886	eng	It was like that.
3727887	eng	I think Tom is like that.
3727888	eng	I don't think it works like that.
3727889	eng	We aren't like that.
3727890	eng	They aren't like that.
3727891	eng	I hadn't thought of it like that.
3727892	eng	I never really thought of it like that.
3727893	eng	Girls don't ordinarily like that.
3727894	eng	I do wish Tom would stop calling me that.
3727895	eng	I suspect you've already done that.
3727896	eng	I bet you tell everyone that.
3727897	eng	I can appreciate that.
3727898	eng	I can certainly appreciate that.
3727899	eng	It's hard to believe that there are still those who believe that.
3727900	eng	I believe you believe that.
3727901	eng	I don't think there's much chance of that.
3727902	eng	Surely Tom is aware of that.
3727903	eng	Tom knows me by sight, I'm sure of that.
3727904	eng	You have no proof of that.
3727905	eng	That's enough of that.
3727906	eng	I don't know what made me think of that.
3727907	eng	I don't like the look of that.
3727908	eng	I'm not too certain of that.
3727909	eng	You don't want any part of that.
3727910	eng	I'm watching that.
3727911	eng	I don't see Tom doing that.
3727912	eng	I don't want to discourage you from doing that.
3727913	eng	I think I remember doing that.
3727914	eng	I hated myself for doing that.
3727915	eng	I don't see anybody doing that.
3727916	eng	I have a hard time believing that.
3727917	eng	I'm not just saying that.
3727918	eng	I knew you weren't OK with that.
3727919	eng	You can't go public with that.
3727920	eng	I'm not concerned with that.
3727921	eng	I'm comfortable with that.
3727922	eng	I guess you can't help me with that.
3727923	eng	I can't compete with that.
3727924	eng	Stop playing with that.
3727925	eng	I can work with that.
3727926	eng	I was cool with that.
3727927	eng	There's only one problem with that.
3727928	eng	I could never get away with that.
3727929	eng	I can see how you might think that.
3727930	eng	I can feel that.
3727931	eng	We have plenty of time for all that.
3727932	eng	I can prevent all that.
3727933	eng	I wanted to make sure you told them that.
3727934	eng	I can't believe I just promised Tom that.
3727935	eng	Try telling Tom that.
3727936	eng	I think you'd better tell Tom that.
3727937	eng	I think you'd better not tell Tom that.
3727938	eng	I really believe you mean that.
3727939	eng	It's a little more than that.
3727940	eng	Hey, I can't ask for more than that.
3727941	eng	It was more than that.
3727942	eng	Tom deserves more than that.
3727943	eng	It's a lot more than that.
3727944	eng	I'm hoping to make stay a little longer than that.
3727945	eng	Tom is smarter than that.
3727946	eng	You need to be better than that.
3727947	eng	You know me better than that.
3727948	eng	You deserve much better than that.
3727949	eng	Tom knows better than that.
3727950	eng	I raised you better than that.
3727951	eng	I taught you better than that.
3727952	eng	You know better than that.
3727953	eng	I'd like to think that there's more to it than that.
3727954	eng	You're better than that.
3727955	eng	I can't really put a price on that.
3727956	eng	I'll stake my reputation on that.
3727957	eng	I insist on that.
3727958	eng	Tom would do that.
3727959	eng	I don't know what made me do that.
3727960	eng	Well, in this country you're not allowed to do that.
3727961	eng	This isn't the time or the place to do that.
3727962	eng	I don't know what possessed me to do that.
3727963	eng	You've had more than enough time to do that.
3727964	eng	You really shouldn't bother to do that.
3727965	eng	Nobody's forcing you to do that.
3727966	eng	This is the last time I'm telling you to do that.
3727967	eng	I couldn't let you do that.
3727968	eng	You should totally do that.
3727969	eng	I was so looking forward to that.
3727970	eng	I don't think it'll come to that.
3727971	eng	It's not going to come to that.
3727972	eng	We're hoping it doesn't come to that.
3727973	eng	I don't think you really want to call attention to that.
3727974	eng	I never found the answer to that.
3727975	eng	I'm guessing you already know the answer to that.
3727976	eng	Tom will never consent to that.
3727977	eng	I saw to that.
3727978	eng	I have but one thing to say to that.
3727979	eng	I can top that.
3727980	eng	You can help stop that.
3727981	eng	I'm so sad to hear that.
3727982	eng	I needed to hear that.
3727983	eng	You didn't need to hear that.
3727984	eng	Tom was actually rather relieved to hear that.
3727985	eng	Tom gave up on everything after that.
3727986	eng	There's no getting over that.
3727987	eng	I can answer that.
3727988	eng	Perhaps I can answer that.
3727989	eng	I never really cared for that.
3727990	eng	I thought you'd already been compensated for that.
3727991	eng	I could get you arrested for that.
3727992	eng	This isn't the time or the place for that.
3727993	eng	You're too late for that.
3727994	eng	I think it's already too late for that.
3727995	eng	I could kick myself for that.
3727996	eng	I hated Tom for that.
3727997	eng	You can't lock me up for that.
3727998	eng	I don't have an answer for that.
3727999	eng	I don't think I'm ready for that.
3728000	eng	Everybody tells themselves that.
3728001	eng	You can't look at that.
3728002	eng	I don't know how you can eat that.
3728003	eng	I can respect that.
3728004	eng	I totally get that.
3728005	eng	I think we can accept that.
3728006	eng	I thought we were past that.
3728007	eng	I must ask you to do just that.
3728008	eng	Tom is very excited about that.
3728009	eng	Let's see about that.
3728010	eng	I feel horrible about that.
3728011	eng	Don't tell me you don't know anything about that.
3728012	eng	You'd have at ask Tom about that.
3728013	eng	I can try to talk to Tom about that.
3728014	eng	I know a thing or two about that.
3728015	eng	I'm real sorry to hear about that.
3728016	eng	We're very curious about that.
3728017	eng	Tom is kind of freaked out about that.
3728018	eng	Tom has been talking to Mary about that.
3728019	eng	I'll worry about that.
3728020	eng	You're smooth, I'll give you that.
3728021	eng	It's not for me to tell you that.
3728022	eng	I'm under no obligation to tell you that.
3728023	eng	I wanted to make sure you saw that.
3728024	eng	Tom knew that.
3728025	eng	I wanted to make sure your family knew that.
3728026	eng	Look, I know that.
3728027	eng	I should know that.
3728028	eng	You're really out of line, you know that.
3728029	eng	I don't want to know how you know that.
3728030	eng	You never heard me say that.
3728031	eng	I most certainly didn't say that.
3728032	eng	Tom knows his way around a boat.
3728033	eng	Let's get back to the boat.
3728034	eng	You really are a spoiled brat.
3728035	eng	We're forever in your debt.
3728036	eng	I can predict how Tom will react.
3728037	eng	Tom and I made a pact.
3728038	eng	Let's stay in close contact.
3728039	eng	That'd be perfect.
3728040	eng	That's actually perfect.
3728041	eng	Tom is vital to our project.
3728042	eng	Have a little respect.
3728043	eng	Show a little respect.
3728044	eng	You already have my respect.
3728045	eng	I've failed in every respect.
3728046	eng	I'm not a suspect.
3728047	eng	We have an image to protect.
3728048	eng	They were very strict.
3728049	eng	Go with your instinct.
3728050	eng	You need to sell more product.
3728051	eng	Tom is just getting cold feet.
3728052	eng	I've got cold feet.
3728053	eng	Tom shifted his feet.
3728054	eng	Tom has trouble thinking on his feet.
3728055	eng	Tom scrambled to his feet.
3728056	eng	Tom leaped to his feet.
3728057	eng	Tom got to his feet.
3728058	eng	I'm used to thinking on my feet.
3728059	eng	We need to find another way to make ends meet.
3728060	eng	It's a pleasure to finally meet.
3728061	eng	Tom didn't look both ways before crossing the street.
3728062	eng	Tom left the building and walked down the street.
3728063	eng	The less I know, the more interested I get.
3728064	eng	I don't know how much worse this'll get.
3728065	eng	I know how overwhelming it can all get.
3728066	eng	I only wanted to forget.
3728067	eng	Tom says he drinks to forget.
3728068	eng	It's a trip I won't forget.
3728069	eng	It's dead quiet.
3728070	eng	It's almost too quiet.
3728071	eng	The floor is quiet.
3728072	eng	The house seemed strangely quiet.
3728073	eng	The house is very quiet.
3728074	eng	I chartered a jet.
3728075	eng	I'll take the jacket.
3728076	eng	You might want to lose the dinner jacket.
3728077	eng	Tom removed his jacket.
3728078	eng	There's no way I'm going to pay for your ticket.
3728079	eng	Tom pulled an envelope out of his pocket.
3728080	eng	Tom searched in his pocket.
3728081	eng	Tom paid in cash that he happened to have in his pocket.
3728082	eng	Stock prices could skyrocket.
3728083	eng	Tom vomited into the bucket.
3728084	eng	Tom is sitting on a picnic blanket.
3728085	eng	Let's see your wallet.
3728086	eng	Tom removed a card from his wallet.
3728087	eng	Tom sighed and pulled out his wallet.
3728088	eng	That's how we met.
3728089	eng	You're the most amazing person I've ever met.
3728090	eng	Hi, I'm Tom. I don't think we've ever met.
3728091	eng	I don't want you anywhere near the medicine cabinet.
3728092	eng	The only way this is going to happen is in secret.
3728093	eng	Tom knows his way around a movie set.
3728094	eng	I know all the skeletons in your closet.
3728095	eng	Tom isn't crying anymore, but he's still obviously still upset.
3728096	eng	You had to know Tom might get upset.
3728097	eng	You just don't want to get wet.
3728098	eng	Tom said that there were others on the island, but I haven't seen anyone else yet.
3728099	eng	Well, I wouldn't do that quite yet.
3728100	eng	It's too early to tell yet.
3728101	eng	I don't think they've found out about Tom yet.
3728102	eng	We've received no explanation yet.
3728103	eng	It hasn't come up yet.
3728105	eng	You haven't seen all the family pictures yet.
3728106	eng	I may do it yet.
3728107	eng	I don't want to say goodbye just yet.
3728108	eng	Don't tell Tom just yet.
3728109	eng	Let's not pack our bags just yet.
3728110	eng	I don't feel ready for that just yet.
3728111	eng	I haven't dismissed you yet.
3728112	eng	I'm not finished with you yet.
3728113	eng	There's hope for you yet.
3728114	eng	That's what I don't know yet.
3728115	eng	Tom was in on the theft.
3728116	eng	Tom nodded his head and left.
3728117	eng	Tom nodded and left.
3728118	eng	You've got one minute left.
3728119	eng	You have one move left.
3728120	eng	There's only one torpedo left.
3728121	eng	I don't have many years left.
3728122	eng	Tom is the only patient left.
3728123	eng	That's your gift.
3728124	eng	I'll take the first shift.
3728125	eng	I'll take first shift.
3728126	eng	I get your drift.
3728127	eng	I must be getting soft.
3728128	eng	Let's get one thing straight.
3728129	eng	Let me get something straight.
3728130	eng	Let me make sure I have this straight.
3728131	eng	OK, let's see if I've got this straight.
3728132	eng	I've been up 36 hours straight.
3728133	eng	I never could get that straight.
3728134	eng	There's something we have to get straight.
3728135	eng	Tom pushed against the door with all his weight.
3728136	eng	Tom expected more of a fight.
3728137	eng	Tom decided it wasn't really worth the fight.
3728138	eng	Tom knows better than to fight.
3728139	eng	Tom switched off the light.
3728140	eng	Step into the light.
3728141	eng	Tom cried out with delight.
3728142	eng	I booked us an earlier flight.
3728143	ces	Oba kamarádi tonou v představách.
3728144	heb	כתוב בבקשה את שמך ואת כתובתך.
3728145	deu	Tom jauchzte entzückt auf.
3728146	ces	Během bohoslužby osvětlují svíčky oltář.
3728147	deu	Ich habe uns einen früheren Flug gebucht.
3728148	heb	אלו חברים שלי.
3728149	deu	Tritt ins Licht!
3728150	deu	Treten Sie ins Licht!
3728151	deu	Tretet ins Licht!
3728152	deu	Tom schaltete das Licht aus.
3728153	heb	כתבי בבקשה את שמך ואת כתובתך.
3728154	heb	איפה אביו עכשיו?
3728155	heb	הזמנתי לנו טיסה מוקדמת יותר.
3728156	deu	Tom stemmte sich mit seinem ganzen Gewicht gegen die Tür.
3728157	deu	Ich bin seit geschlagenen 36 Stunden wach.
3728158	heb	אני ער כבר 36 שעות רצוף.
3728159	deu	Das kann ich nicht wirklich in Geld bemessen.
3728160	heb	אני ערה כבר 36 שעות רצופות.
3728162	heb	אתה ומפיר?
3728163	deu	Ich würde mir gern vorstellen, dass das noch nicht alles ist.
3728164	deu	Dafür könnte ich dich hinter Gitter bringen.
3728165	heb	שתה איתי, טום.
3728166	ukr	Не бреши. Будь чесним.
3728167	heb	אני עובד בתחום האומנות.
3728168	ukr	Не бреши! Кажи правду!
3728169	heb	אני עובדת בתחום האמנות.
3728170	deu	Ich habe gedacht, dass du dafür schon entschädigt worden bist.
3728171	heb	זה הבית שגרתי בו כשהייתי קטן.
3728172	heb	סוסים אוכלים עשב.
3728173	ukr	Я б навіть просто "дивно" залишив.
3728175	heb	שתיתי את הקפה.
3728176	ukr	Він дув у трубу і створював чудовий звук.
3728177	heb	התיק שלך על השולחן שלי.
3728178	ces	Naklonila hlavu na stranu a pozorně se na mě podívala svýma velkýma očima.
3728179	eng	This is the house where I lived when I was young.
3728180	eng	This is the neighborhood where I lived when I was younger.
3728183	eng	This is the neighborhood I lived in when I was younger.
3728184	ukr	Ти сьогодні бачив Павла?
3728185	eng	I'm on your flight.
3728186	eng	Tom put the traveler up for the night.
3728187	eng	We only need shelter for the night.
3728188	eng	I could hear you pacing all night.
3728189	eng	I'm the one who danced with the kids all night.
3728190	eng	Tom has been at it all night.
3728191	eng	It's a school night.
3728192	eng	I had an awful night.
3728193	eng	Tom returned very late at night.
3728194	eng	I wasn't even there that night.
3728195	eng	Tom said he wasn't even there that night.
3728196	eng	We loved what you said last night.
3728197	eng	I don't remember that being there last night.
3728198	eng	Tom has been working since late last night.
3728199	eng	I had that dream again last night.
3728200	eng	I understand you and Tom were together last night.
3728201	eng	I left my watch on the counter last night.
3728202	eng	I thought that you were coming over last night.
3728203	eng	I told you everything I knew last night.
3728204	eng	Tom looked pretty healthy last night.
3728205	eng	I've arranged for a dinner tomorrow night.
3728206	eng	There's going to be a press conference tonight.
3728207	eng	Let's go on a date tonight.
3728208	eng	I'm supposed to have the house to myself tonight.
3728209	eng	Hey, guess what I'm doing tonight.
3728210	eng	I still think we should've told your dad where we're going tonight.
3728211	eng	I'm waitressing tonight.
3728212	eng	Tom sang better than usual tonight.
3728213	eng	Tom is flying in tonight.
3728214	eng	I don't think we have to worry about anybody showing up tonight.
3728215	eng	I'm done for tonight.
3728216	eng	I was wondering if I could sleep over at Tom's tonight.
3728217	eng	I don't have the energy for this tonight.
3728218	eng	We're having TV dinners tonight.
3728219	eng	Tom is going to chill with us tonight.
3728221	eng	I'm not having dinner with you tonight.
3728222	eng	I'd love to come by tonight.
3728223	eng	That's Tom on the right.
3728224	eng	We need to get this one right.
3728225	eng	Let's say for the moment that you're right.
3728226	eng	There's nothing worse than being half right.
3728227	eng	At least I got something right.
3728228	eng	I just want to get this paragraph right.
3728229	eng	That's quite all right.
3728230	eng	Just pray I'm right.
3728231	eng	I thought I'd know when the time was right.
3728232	eng	I thought Tom would know when the time was right.
3728233	eng	I only need another few days to make things right.
3728234	eng	I'm going to make this right.
3728235	eng	It feels right.
3728236	eng	You have to do that just right.
3728237	eng	For once in your life, you're exactly right.
3728238	eng	You gave me a fright.
3728239	eng	You gave me such a fright.
3728240	eng	Tom was out of sight.
3728241	eng	Tell your men to stay out of sight.
3728242	eng	Tom came in sight.
3728243	eng	There was no hope in sight.
3728244	eng	Tom is nowhere in sight.
3728245	eng	The end is in sight.
3728246	eng	Tom will be killed on sight.
3728247	eng	I never knew you and Tom were so tight.
3728248	eng	I didn't plan on being caught.
3728249	eng	I don't plan on getting caught.
3728250	eng	Tom is clearly agitated and distraught.
3728251	eng	My testimony can't be bought.
3728252	eng	You're even dumber than I thought.
3728253	eng	It's just as I thought.
3728254	eng	I don't know what I thought.
3728255	eng	That's a nice thought.
3728256	eng	Tom seems to be deep in thought.
3728257	eng	Tom was still lost in thought.
3728258	eng	Tom is lost in thought.
3728259	eng	OK, hold that thought.
3728260	eng	That's an ugly thought.
3728261	eng	Tom shut the cage and latched it.
3728262	eng	I think you liked it.
3728263	eng	Someone else must've opened it.
3728264	eng	I might have mentioned it.
3728265	eng	Tom's cell phone rang and he answered it.
3728266	eng	Nobody could've guessed it.
3728267	eng	You can't have wanted it.
3728268	eng	I've accepted it.
3728269	eng	I've already accepted it.
3728270	eng	Tom never actually came out and said it.
3728271	eng	I can respect why you did it.
3728272	eng	I don't know how they're going to avoid it.
3728273	eng	I don't think I could stand it.
3728274	eng	Tom could hardly stand it.
3728275	eng	I'll let you know when I find it.
3728276	eng	Tom said I should've been able to find it.
3728277	eng	I'm going to find it.
3728278	eng	Take it from me, Tom, you'll never find it.
3728279	eng	I don't know who's behind it.
3728280	eng	We have evidence that Tom was behind it.
3728281	eng	That's how I found it.
3728282	eng	I want everything replaced just as we found it.
3728283	eng	I don't know how Tom stood it.
3728284	eng	Tom couldn't face it.
3728285	eng	I'm so glad you made it.
3728286	eng	Tom's name was on the list with a question mark beside it.
3728287	eng	That's the way I see it.
3728288	eng	Tom told me he had a right to see it.
3728289	eng	You'll never see it.
3728290	eng	They can't see it.
3728291	eng	If something bad happened, I didn't see it.
3728292	eng	I always knew you were going to make it.
3728293	eng	I don't think I'm going to make it.
3728294	eng	I don't think Tom is going to make it.
3728295	eng	Hey, you're not going to make it.
3728296	eng	You'll never make it.
3728297	eng	I suppose Tom didn't make it.
3728298	eng	Trust me, you'll like it.
3728299	eng	Don't think I won't like it.
3728300	eng	I'm sure you won't like it.
3728301	eng	Tom didn't dislike it.
3728302	eng	You gave me your word and you broke it.
3728303	eng	Now you've done it.
3728304	eng	I said ignore it.
3728305	eng	Tom is starting to lose it.
3728306	eng	Tom said I might lose it.
3728307	eng	Give us a chance to investigate it.
3728308	eng	You can take it or leave it.
3728309	eng	You can't just have it.
3728310	eng	I'm beginning to believe it.
3728311	eng	I bet I can prove it.
3728312	eng	I don't have to prove it.
3728313	eng	I'm going to prove it.
3728314	eng	I didn't say they deserve it.
3728315	eng	I told them to stuff it.
3728316	eng	Tom didn't see anything. I made sure of it.
3728317	eng	Tom was sure of it.
3728318	eng	I hated every minute of it.
3728319	eng	Tom is loving every minute of it.
3728320	eng	You don't know the half of it.
3728321	eng	You'll get the hang of it.
3728322	eng	Tom never thought anything of it.
3728323	eng	Don't think of it.
3728324	eng	I couldn't make head or tail of it.
3728325	eng	I'm sure Tom will be able to get to the bottom of it.
3728326	eng	There's a mystery here and I want to get to the bottom of it.
3728327	eng	That's only part of it.
3728328	eng	I don't want any part of it.
3728329	eng	That's the last of it.
3728330	eng	Make the most of it.
3728331	eng	This isn't the worst of it.
3728332	eng	I wouldn't make a big deal out of it.
3728333	eng	You've taken all the fun out of it.
3728334	eng	Leave us out of it.
3728335	eng	I just can't get out of it.
3728336	eng	I did my best to keep you out of it.
3728337	eng	Tom seems really out of it.
3728338	eng	Tom is still pretty out of it.
3728339	eng	Tom picked up the letter and begins reading it.
3728340	eng	Tom couldn't resist touching it.
3728341	eng	I hated myself for thinking it.
3728342	eng	Tom took a soda from the fridge and started drinking it.
3728343	eng	Tom saw that Mary was losing it.
3728344	eng	I don't know how you can keep eating it.
3728345	eng	You're not getting it.
3728346	eng	You don't have to watch it.
3728347	eng	This is pretty much it.
3728348	eng	I'll talk you through it.
3728349	eng	I wish I had a chance to finish it.
3728350	eng	Tom was OK with it.
3728351	eng	Tom seems OK with it.
3728352	eng	I don't know if I can cope with it.
3728353	eng	I can live with it.
3728354	eng	I'll have to live with it.
3728355	eng	You have to live with it.
3728356	eng	You'll learn to live with it.
3728357	eng	I had to go along with it.
3728358	eng	I can't find anything wrong with it.
3728359	eng	I'm going to stick with it.
3728360	eng	This is my problem and I'm going to deal with it.
3728361	eng	They're having fun with it.
3728362	eng	I'll run with it.
3728363	eng	Luck has nothing to do with it.
3728364	eng	I had practically nothing to do with it.
3728365	eng	I don't know how Tom put up with it.
3728366	eng	I'm vaguely familiar with it.
3728367	eng	Do what you want with it.
3728368	eng	They're getting away with it.
3728369	eng	Tom isn't getting away with it.
3728370	eng	Nobody crosses me and gets away with it.
3728371	eng	I know it's going to be worth it.
3728372	eng	Let's chuck it.
3728373	eng	That's not why I took it.
3728374	eng	That could explain it.
3728375	eng	I'll stake my job on it.
3728376	eng	You have my personal word on it.
3728377	eng	I give you my word on it.
3728378	eng	I'll stake my life on it.
3728379	eng	I'm going to put my name on it.
3728380	eng	Tell them we're working on it.
3728381	eng	Tom looks like he's really concentrating on it.
3728382	eng	Buy me another beer and I'll think on it.
3728383	eng	I've already put Tom to work on it.
3728384	eng	I thought Tom was in on it.
3728385	eng	You might want to get in on it.
3728386	eng	I'll stake my reputation on it.
3728387	eng	That'd do it.
3728388	eng	If it was easy, anybody could do it.
3728389	eng	This should do it.
3728390	eng	I helped other people do it.
3728391	eng	That's how we do it.
3728392	eng	That's when I'll do it.
3728393	eng	I let Tom do it.
3728394	eng	Tom isn't too old to do it.
3728395	eng	The longer you wait, the harder it's going to be to do it.
3728396	eng	I'm not saying we're not going to do it.
3728397	eng	You just have to want to do it.
3728398	eng	That's the way to do it.
3728399	eng	You mean you couldn't do it.
3728400	eng	Don't think I won't do it.
3728401	eng	OK, let's just do it.
3728402	eng	That should about do it.
3728403	eng	You would have gotten away with it if Tom hadn't seen you do it.
3728404	eng	Don't get too used to it.
3728405	eng	I couldn't swear to it.
3728406	eng	Let's get to it.
3728407	eng	Tom beat you to it.
3728408	eng	I saw to it.
3728409	eng	Tell them we're looking into it.
3728410	eng	Put your backs into it.
3728411	eng	I really don't want to get into it.
3728412	eng	I never plan anything if I can help it.
3728413	eng	I don't know what we can do to stop it.
3728414	eng	If there's something I ought to know, I'd like to hear it.
3728415	eng	Don't expect me to lose any sleep over it.
3728416	eng	I'm saying get over it.
3728417	eng	They'll get over it.
3728418	eng	I'm completely over it.
3728419	eng	There's no need for it.
3728420	eng	We paid for it.
3728421	eng	We'll wait here for it.
3728422	eng	Anyone stupid enough to go there is asking for it.
3728423	eng	I almost fell for it.
3728424	eng	We're going to have to make a run for it.
3728425	eng	You've just got to go for it.
3728426	eng	We'll pay you for it.
3728427	eng	You were so ready for it.
3728428	eng	I suppose that's it.
3728429	eng	That's how Tom does it.
3728430	eng	That nails it.
3728431	eng	I'm not at liberty to discuss it.
3728432	eng	You were bad at it.
3728433	eng	I was good at it.
3728434	eng	They're still going at it.
3728435	eng	You're going to eat it.
3728436	eng	Let me inspect it.
3728437	eng	It'll happen again if we don't correct it.
3728438	eng	Tom asked for it and he's going to get it.
3728439	eng	I think I'm starting to get it.
3728440	eng	We should never forget it.
3728441	eng	Tom flipped the coin in the air and then caught it.
3728442	eng	I didn't expect you to admit it.
3728443	eng	Everyone felt it.
3728444	eng	Just tell me how you want it.
3728445	eng	That's certainly not it.
3728446	eng	I'm very much against it.
3728447	eng	I know you're up against it.
3728448	eng	You've lost it.
3728449	eng	I assume you all read about it.
3728450	eng	I'm sure you all read about it.
3728451	eng	Tom has never talked about it.
3728452	eng	I'm very excited about it.
3728453	eng	Don't get too relaxed about it.
3728454	eng	We should've been told about it.
3728455	eng	I feel really good about it.
3728456	eng	Tom was very nice about it.
3728457	eng	I don't want you even thinking about it.
3728458	eng	I never stop thinking about it.
3728459	eng	I've got a real good feeling about it.
3728460	eng	I look forward to hearing about it.
3728461	eng	Let Tom go and we'll talk about it.
3728462	eng	I'm not going to talk about it.
3728463	eng	Let's hope they don't even think about it.
3728464	eng	Don't you even think about it.
3728465	eng	You don't even want to think about it.
3728466	eng	I guess I didn't really think about it.
3728467	eng	Someone should write a book about it.
3728468	eng	There's not much Tom can do about it.
3728469	eng	Tom is kind of worked up about it.
3728470	eng	I guess that's about it.
3728471	eng	We were very serious about it.
3728472	eng	Don't fret about it.
3728473	eng	Tom was a good sport about it.
3728474	eng	I'll tell you about it.
3728475	eng	Tom said you knew about it.
3728476	eng	Tom doesn't have to know about it.
3728477	eng	Tom isn't going to know about it.
3728478	eng	I can live without it.
3728479	eng	This was your big chance, Tom, and you blew it.
3728480	eng	I knew you'd blow it.
3728481	eng	I don't want to blow it.
3728482	eng	Don't tell me you don't know it.
3728483	eng	I'll be up and around before you know it.
3728484	eng	I need to hear you say it.
3728485	eng	I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
3728486	eng	That was worth the wait.
3728487	eng	You're welcome to wait.
3728488	eng	It's going to have to wait.
3728489	eng	I could hardly wait.
3728490	eng	We should be OK here for a bit.
3728491	eng	Just sit there for a bit.
3728492	eng	I don't like the sound of that one bit.
3728493	eng	I'm a creature of habit.
3728494	eng	Tom is a creature of habit.
3728495	eng	We're all creatures of habit.
3728496	eng	Tom is asking for credit.
3728497	eng	It doesn't fit.
3728498	eng	I knew I could make it fit.
3728499	eng	I don't care about profit.
3728500	eng	We think Tom knows more about Mary's death than he's willing to admit.
3728501	eng	I'm doing the speed limit.
3728502	eng	They've upped my limit.
3728503	eng	Tom is going to die in the morning for a crime he didn't commit.
3728504	eng	Tom was about to get his learner's permit.
3728505	eng	I admire your grit.
3728506	eng	I have to say I admire your spirit.
3728507	eng	We're more than willing to extend our visit.
3728508	eng	It looks like you could use a new suit.
3728509	eng	You can imagine how Tom felt.
3728510	eng	I feel as good as I've ever felt.
3728511	eng	You can imagine how they felt.
3728512	eng	If Tom escapes, it'll be your fault.
3728513	eng	The rest was my fault.
3728514	eng	You made that difficult.
3728515	eng	I'm practically an adult.
3728516	eng	This is a good result.
3728518	eng	Sometimes the most important clues are the ones that seem the most insignificant.
3728519	eng	I didn't know what it all meant.
3728520	eng	That's very elegant.
3728521	eng	I thought you were brilliant.
3728522	eng	Tom looked indignant.
3728523	eng	We really have to be more tolerant.
3728524	eng	Tom seemed reluctant.
3728526	eng	Just tell them I'm a consultant.
3728527	eng	I think birthdays are important.
3728528	eng	Tom realized Mary might be telling him something important.
3728529	eng	That's very distant.
3728530	eng	I know what's relevant.
3728531	eng	I can put it back in the drawer if you want.
3728532	eng	You can think that if you want.
3728533	eng	Believe anything you want.
3728534	eng	They might have what you want.
3728535	eng	There is a price for always getting what you want.
3728536	eng	They might sell what you want.
3728537	eng	I'll kiss you if that's what you want.
3728538	eng	I can be exactly what you want.
3728539	eng	The ruins are truly magnificent.
3728540	eng	I'll be out of jail as soon as the police realize I'm innocent.
3728541	eng	They must know I'm innocent.
3728542	eng	I've improved my reaction time by almost thirty percent.
3728543	eng	Tom met with a traffic accident.
3728544	eng	Tom couldn't bring himself to tell Mary about the accident.
3728545	eng	Tom's death may not have been an accident.
3728546	eng	Tom has been missing since the incident.
3728547	eng	That was evident.
3728548	eng	I haven't exactly been prudent.
3728549	eng	Tom was just a lonely exchange student.
3728550	eng	I hope I can be a worthy student.
3728551	eng	It wasn't sufficient.
3728552	eng	I just had a meeting with the new client.
3728553	eng	That's real convenient.
3728554	eng	It's a little inconvenient.
3728555	eng	Perhaps they thought you were a patient.
3728556	eng	Tom was a mental patient.
3728557	eng	Tom looked impatient.
3728558	eng	Tom felt himself growing impatient.
3728559	eng	They became silent.
3728560	eng	They were silent.
3728561	eng	The crowd fell silent.
3728562	eng	Tom fell silent.
3728563	eng	Your paper was excellent.
3728564	eng	I could never be violent.
3728565	eng	They're not all violent.
3728566	eng	Tom was disconcerted by the announcement.
3728567	eng	This is why I didn't want to make an announcement.
3728568	eng	We have a signed divorce agreement.
3728569	eng	Tom nodded his head in agreement.
3728570	eng	Tom nodded his head to show his agreement.
3728571	eng	I'm not trying to back out of that agreement.
3728572	eng	They seem to be having a disagreement.
3728573	eng	Use your best judgment.
3728574	eng	I can live with that arrangement.
3728575	eng	They're in their element.
3728576	eng	Maybe I'll come out of retirement.
3728577	eng	The police will be very interested to learn that you're keeping Tom locked up in the basement.
3728578	eng	Tom's eyes twinkle with amusement.
3728579	eng	Tom was puzzled by Mary's statement.
3728580	eng	I made an error in judgment.
3728581	eng	I've always trusted your judgment.
3728582	eng	I've always had complete confidence in your judgment.
3728583	eng	Tom glanced around in astonishment.

3728607	eng	We've received our first assignment.
3728608	eng	Tom will be out in a moment.
3728609	eng	Tom will join you in a moment.
3728610	eng	They chatted for a moment.
3728611	eng	Tom felt dazed for a moment.
3728612	eng	Tom stopped reading for a moment.
3728613	eng	Tom thought about it for a moment.
3728614	eng	They were silent for a moment.
3728615	eng	I'll be out of your way in just a moment.
3728616	eng	It was an awkward moment.
3728617	eng	Tom is caught up in the moment.
3728618	eng	Look, we're safe enough for the moment.
3728619	eng	I'm seeing someone at the moment.
3728620	eng	We have some pressing issues to deal with at the moment.
3728621	eng	Tom isn't interested in a promotion at the moment.
3728622	eng	Tom and Mary looked at each other for a long moment.
3728623	eng	That was a beautiful moment.
3728624	eng	Tom hasn't been looking forward to this moment.
3728625	eng	Tom might be a lot safer than we are at this moment.
3728626	eng	We have a few questions concerning Tom's medical treatment.
3728627	eng	I neither expect nor require any special treatment.
3728628	eng	Tom is entitled to better treatment.
3728629	eng	It's a lifetime commitment.
3728630	eng	It's a serious commitment.
3728631	eng	It's a lifetime appointment.
3728632	eng	You missed your ten o'clock appointment.
3728633	eng	I came to get an appointment.
3728634	eng	Tom couldn't hide his disappointment.
3728635	eng	We have a warrant to search your apartment.
3728636	eng	I wasn't in your apartment.
3728637	eng	Tom was found strangled in his apartment.
3728638	eng	Tom trudged up the stairs to his apartment.
3728639	eng	The AC's out in my apartment.
3728640	eng	We ended up having a big argument.
3728641	eng	You make an interesting argument.
3728642	eng	They seem to be having an argument.
3728643	eng	Tom would be a formidable opponent.
3728644	eng	Tom is a worthy opponent.
3728645	eng	Tom is way behind on his rent.
3728646	eng	Tom just wants to be different.
3728647	eng	Tom's priorities are different.
3728648	eng	I don't know why I expected anything different.
3728649	eng	I feel different.
3728650	eng	It's been different.
3728651	eng	This time it's different.
3728652	eng	That's what makes us different.
3728653	eng	It was totally different.
3728654	eng	It doesn't feel any different.
3728655	eng	Tom will never consent.
3728656	eng	Let's be content.
3728657	eng	Tom was content.
3728658	eng	It's a black tie event.
3728659	eng	Tom couldn't paint.
3728660	eng	You make a good point.
3728661	eng	Let me get to the point.
3728662	eng	Whether I have a problem with it isn't the point.
3728663	eng	That's my whole point.
3728664	eng	Everybody has a breaking point.
3728665	eng	Tom was robbed at gunpoint.
3728666	eng	Don't hold back on my account.
3728667	eng	That's the exact amount.
3728668	eng	Tom is fast asleep on the cot.
3728669	eng	That's as far as I got.
3728670	eng	It's no big secret that Tom stepped out on his wife every chance he got.
3728671	eng	Tom is the only family he's got.
3728672	eng	You gave as good as you got.
3728673	eng	It's a little hot.
3728674	eng	Tom was getting hot.
3728675	eng	You think you're so hot.
3728676	eng	You're incredibly hot.
3728677	eng	I gave it a shot.
3728678	eng	You'll get only one shot.
3728679	eng	You're going to get yourself shot.
3728680	eng	It's kind of a long shot.
3728681	eng	I'm pretty sure I had a tetanus shot.
3728682	eng	Take your best shot.
3728683	eng	That was a lucky shot.
3728684	eng	Tom is an expert with a slingshot.
3728685	eng	Like I said, you're an idiot.
3728686	eng	I've been an idiot.
3728687	eng	I move around a lot.
3728688	eng	That sounds like a lot.
3728689	eng	Tom is keeping a low profile, so he stays home a lot.
3728690	eng	I know it's asking a lot.
3728691	eng	It could matter a lot.
3728692	eng	I don't expect a lot.
3728693	eng	Tom wasn't around a whole lot.
3728694	eng	Tom put the car into gear and slowly pulled out of the parking lot.
3728695	eng	Tom is sitting in his car in the parking lot.
3728696	eng	Tom's name will stay on the ballot.
3728697	eng	You forgot to mention whether it was successful or not.
3728698	eng	It happens whether you plan it or not.
3728699	eng	I can't imagine why not.
3728700	eng	Tom and I got off on the wrong foot.
3728701	eng	I think we got off on the wrong foot.
3728702	eng	Tom pushed the silent alarm with his foot.
3728703	eng	Drop your weapon or I'll shoot.
3728704	eng	Tom began to shoot.
3728705	eng	It looks like you missed a spot.
3728706	eng	I was arrested on the spot.
3728707	eng	Tom is in a tough spot.
3728708	eng	It's hard to accept.
3728709	eng	I know it's hard to accept.
3728710	eng	Tom has no choice but to accept.
3728711	eng	Tom was snoring loudly while he slept.
3728712	eng	I'm not usually this inept.
3728713	eng	You said I wasn't to interrupt.
3728714	eng	I don't think you have the heart.
3728715	eng	I'm nursing a broken heart.
3728716	eng	Tom is a man after my own heart.
3728717	eng	Just tell Tom what's in your heart.
3728718	eng	Just say what's in your heart.
3728719	eng	You have to follow your heart.
3728720	eng	I've always been a romantic at heart.
3728721	eng	I think that's really smart.
3728722	eng	I think you're plenty smart.
3728723	eng	That's my favorite part.
3728724	eng	That's the tough part.
3728725	eng	You already did your part.
3728726	eng	That's the hardest part.
3728727	eng	That's the worst part.
3728728	eng	That was the worst part.
3728729	eng	That's the scary part.
3728730	eng	I'm not falling apart.
3728731	eng	Only an expert can tell them apart.
3728732	eng	We're worlds apart.
3728733	eng	Tom woke with a start.
3728734	eng	That would've been a good start.
3728735	eng	I need a place to start.
3728736	eng	That might be a good place to start.
3728737	eng	That's a good place to start.
3728738	eng	It's a great place to start.
3728739	eng	It's a perfect place for us to start.
3728740	eng	This was a stupid idea from the very start.
3728741	eng	Tom was able to get us all tickets to tonight's concert.
3728742	eng	Go to yellow alert.
3728743	eng	I don't have a favorite shirt.
3728744	eng	Tom is wearing sunglasses and no shirt.
3728745	eng	That's a real comfort.
3728746	eng	I can make this very short.
3728747	eng	We've confirmed the report.
3728748	eng	Tom has some very encouraging news to report.
3728749	eng	I only need another few hours to finish this report.
3728750	eng	I filed a missing persons report.
3728751	eng	I can neither confirm or deny that report.
3728752	eng	Tom never paid my mother any child support.
3728753	eng	I told Tom he'd have our full support.
3728754	eng	Tom leaned on Mary's shoulder for support.
3728755	eng	Tom took out his passport.
3728756	eng	It more than hurt.
3728757	eng	A little practice couldn't hurt.
3728758	eng	I suppose a little practice couldn't hurt.
3728759	eng	It's not like anybody got hurt.
3728760	eng	We have to move fast.
3728761	eng	I had to do something fast.
3728762	eng	Tom began to talk fast.
3728763	eng	Keep your eyes open, it's going to happen fast.
3728764	eng	This is all happening a little too fast.
3728765	eng	I can only work so fast.
3728766	eng	Thanks for doing this so fast.
3728767	eng	I wanted to get up early to make them breakfast.
3728768	eng	I invited them to breakfast.
3728769	eng	There's no telling how long they'll last.
3728770	eng	That can't last.
3728771	eng	You should make a toast.
3728772	eng	Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast.
3728773	eng	I don't want to dredge up the past.
3728774	eng	Tom is still the best.
3728775	eng	It's what Tom and I do best.
3728776	eng	Tom was one of our best.
3728777	eng	We'll proceed exactly as you suggest.
3728778	eng	We'll do exactly as you suggest.
3728779	eng	I know it's a lot to digest.
3728780	eng	Get it off your chest.
3728781	eng	Tom told me he needed to get something off his chest.
3728782	eng	I've got to get this off my chest.
3728783	eng	I can be honest.
3728784	eng	Tom was completely honest.
3728785	eng	Tom, give it a rest.
3728786	eng	You need time to rest.
3728787	eng	Tom listened with deep interest.
3728788	eng	We're placing you under arrest.
3728789	eng	I'm placing you under arrest.
3728790	eng	Tom would like to take part in the contest.
3728791	eng	Tom was challenged to a drinking contest.
3728792	eng	You're the guest.
3728793	eng	I have one request.
3728794	eng	Tom clenched his fist.
3728795	eng	Tom claims to be an archaeologist.
3728796	eng	I don't need a psychologist.
3728797	eng	Tom is sort of an amateur sociologist.
3728798	eng	Tom needs to be checked by a specialist.
3728799	eng	Tom's eyes were moist.
3728800	eng	Tom is determined to resist.
3728801	eng	It's hard to resist.
3728802	eng	I can see why that's hard to resist.
3728803	eng	I always thought you should've been an artist.
3728804	eng	I'm betting it doesn't even exist.
3728805	eng	I have to know what we're up against.
3728806	eng	Tom tried to find out what he was up against.
3728807	eng	They were lost.
3728808	eng	I know when I've lost.
3728809	eng	Tom seems to be completely lost.
3728810	eng	Tom is as dumb as a post.
3728811	eng	Get back to your post.
3728812	eng	You were asleep at your post.
3728813	eng	It's a shame you didn't talk to me first.
3728814	eng	I'd have to take a look at it first.
3728815	eng	You must gain Tom's trust first.
3728816	eng	I knew I'd have to see you first.
3728817	eng	I should've checked with you first.
3728818	eng	I wanted to show you first.
3728819	eng	You're the worst.
3728820	eng	I had to earn your trust.
3728821	eng	An EMT put a bandage on Tom's cut.
3728822	eng	Tom would be almost handsome if he got a haircut.
3728823	eng	Tom is all weirded out.
3728824	eng	The buyer backed out.
3728825	eng	I lucked out.
3728826	eng	I'm talked out.
3728827	eng	They walked out.
3728828	eng	Tom has got this all worked out.
3728829	eng	The militia were called out.
3728830	eng	I'm caffeined out.
3728831	eng	Tom is pretty wiped out.
3728832	eng	I'm tapped out.
3728833	eng	They were all tired out.
3728834	eng	I need to find out.
3728835	eng	I'm not waiting around to find out.
3728836	eng	We're going to find out.
3728837	eng	I suppose I'm going to find out.
3728838	eng	I guess you're about to find out.
3728839	eng	Tom knows this town inside out.
3728840	eng	They forced me out.
3728841	eng	It's freaking me out.
3728842	eng	Tom is creeping me out.
3728843	eng	This is really creeping me out.
3728844	eng	You're not buying me out.
3728845	eng	It creeps me out.
3728846	eng	Tom tried to speak, but no words came out.
3728847	eng	The boys are out.
3728848	eng	Tom tried to stand, but his leg gave out.
3728849	eng	Tom stretched himself out.
3728850	eng	I'll show myself out.
3728851	eng	We can talk this thing out.
3728852	eng	I'm not freaking out.
3728853	eng	I saw Tom and Mary making out.
3728854	eng	I don't think this is working out.
3728855	eng	I'm afraid this isn't working out.
3728856	eng	Tom knows the clock is running out.
3728857	eng	Tom says you're moving out.
3728858	eng	I'm not moving out.
3728859	eng	You'd just better watch out.
3728860	eng	I didn't sneak out.
3728861	eng	Tom is going to totally freak out.
3728862	eng	Tom's story didn't check out.
3728863	eng	Tom is sure things will work out.
3728864	eng	I don't think it's going to work out.
3728865	eng	I don't think this is going to work out.
3728866	eng	I had some things to work out.
3728867	eng	I have some things to work out.
3728868	eng	We have some things to work out.
3728869	eng	I planned it all out.
3728870	eng	I'm still trying to sort it all out.
3728871	eng	I just can't figure them out.
3728872	eng	Tom's wife has just thrown him out.
3728873	eng	Tom's girlfriend threw him out.
3728874	eng	I'm going to check Tom out.
3728875	eng	I think I'll help Tom out.
3728876	eng	You're time just ran out.
3728877	eng	Tom is clearly worn out.
3728878	eng	Tom is forbidden to go out.
3728879	eng	I never go out.
3728880	eng	Tom helped me pick these shoes out.
3728881	eng	I thought Tom and Mary were talking things out.
3728882	eng	We'll talk this out.
3728883	eng	Tell us how it turns out.
3728884	eng	Tom must've sold us out.
3728885	eng	Thanks for pointing that out.
3728886	eng	Tom has already figured it out.
3728887	eng	I didn't say we couldn't figure it out.
3728888	eng	I didn't really think it out.
3728889	eng	The helicopter landed and Tom got out.
3728890	eng	Tom was checking you out.
3728891	eng	Don't let Tom catch you on the way out.
3728892	eng	Let me show you the way out.
3728893	eng	I can't imagine what Tom is so worried about.
3728894	eng	I know this isn't what we talked about.
3728895	eng	You're the one they were telling me about.
3728896	eng	That's what I'm here about.
3728897	eng	I know exactly the one you're talking about.
3728898	eng	I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about.
3728899	eng	Tom, this is exactly what we were talking about.
3728900	eng	That's the last thing Tom is thinking about.
3728901	eng	This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about.
3728902	eng	I don't think it's anything to laugh about.
3728903	eng	It's all Tom can talk about.
3728904	eng	You gave us something to talk about.
3728905	eng	There's nothing to think about.
3728906	eng	It's a lot to think about.
3728907	eng	I've completely forgotten what it's about.
3728908	eng	I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.
3728909	eng	I don't know what all the fuss is about.
3728910	eng	We have enough to worry about.
3728911	eng	I don't have anything to feel guilty about.
3728912	eng	I think we'll stay put.
3728913	eng	We were told to stay put.
3728914	eng	Tom thinks we're in some kind of rut.
3728915	eng	I could be next.
3728916	eng	Everyone knows what'll happen next.
3728917	eng	Tell the jury what you saw next.
3728918	eng	I've offended you.
3728919	eng	I'll let you know when I need you.
3728920	eng	That's why I need you.
3728921	eng	That's why we need you.
3728922	eng	I can't believe I just hugged you.
3728923	eng	I really liked you.
3728924	eng	You know, I think that Tom really liked you.
3728925	eng	Look, Tom, I'm sorry I bothered you.
3728926	eng	That's why I hired you.
3728927	eng	That's why I rescued you.
3728928	eng	That's why I loved you.
3728929	eng	From everything you've told me, Tom loved you.
3728930	eng	That's why I followed you.
3728931	eng	I knew I recognized you.
3728932	eng	Tom would kill me if he knew I told you.
3728933	eng	I came to find you.
3728934	eng	I did what I had to do to find you.
3728935	eng	We're a hundred percent behind you.
3728936	eng	I bear no malice toward you.
3728937	eng	We have no wish to inconvenience you.
3728938	eng	Maybe this will convince you.
3728939	eng	You said it was important that I see you.
3728940	eng	I want you to see yourself the way I see you.
3728941	eng	Boy am I glad to see you.
3728942	eng	I needed to see you.
3728943	eng	That's why I came to see you.
3728944	eng	Tom, there's a policeman here to see you.
3728945	eng	It's wonderful to see you.
3728946	eng	I highly doubt Tom wants to see you.
3728947	eng	I have an offer to make you.
3728948	eng	I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
3728949	eng	I could've been like you.
3728950	eng	I need men like you.
3728951	eng	There aren't many men like you.
3728952	eng	I used to be married to a woman who looked a lot like you.
3728953	eng	That's so unlike you.
3728954	eng	I knew the truth would scare you.
3728955	eng	I wouldn't say that around Tom if I were you.
3728956	eng	Tom said they tried to hire you.
3728957	eng	I'm not trying to pressure you.
3728958	eng	I want to please you.
3728959	eng	This may surprise you.
3728960	eng	We can accommodate you.
3728961	eng	I just came here to congratulate you.
3728962	eng	I couldn't just drive off and leave you.
3728963	eng	I won't let her have you.
3728964	eng	They sent me to save you.
3728965	eng	Let's assume for the moment that I believe you.
3728966	eng	I choose to believe you.
3728967	eng	In time, I'm sure Tom will forgive you.
3728968	eng	Buy me a cup of coffee and I might forgive you.
3728969	eng	I can drive you.
3728971	eng	I could look into it if you want me to.
3728972	eng	Tom was ashamed of you.
3728973	eng	You will do what is required of you.
3728974	eng	I'm sure your father would be very proud of you.
3728975	eng	That was really nice of you.
3728976	eng	I have a serious request to make of you.
3728977	eng	That's really noble of you.
3728978	eng	I'm one of you.
3728979	eng	I love each and every one of you.
3728980	eng	Tom took good care of you.
3728981	eng	I could take very good care of you.
3728982	eng	Tom just offered to take care of you.
3728983	eng	That's very mature of you.
3728984	eng	I don't know what made me think of you.
3728985	eng	That's very civil of you.
3728986	eng	Tom is going to kill all of you.
3728987	eng	We weren't making fun of you.
3728988	eng	I don't believe the two of you.
3728989	eng	I'm glad I ran into the two of you.
3728990	eng	Tom said he hadn't seen either of you.
3728991	eng	That's very elitist of you.
3728992	eng	That's enough out of you.
3728993	eng	I'm going to get the truth out of you.
3728994	eng	I have no memory of you.
3728995	eng	Nobody's forcing you.
3728996	eng	Thank you for being you.
3728997	eng	I don't like Tom touching you.
3728998	eng	That's a question I should be asking you.
3728999	eng	That's why I'm asking you.
3729000	eng	You can do this, I'm telling you.
3729001	eng	This is the last time I'm telling you.
3729002	eng	Tom has been misinforming you.
3729003	eng	I have so much to teach you.
3729004	eng	I won't even touch you.
3729005	eng	I've come to make my peace with you.

3729048	eng	I can't believe I've wasted my time with you.
3729049	eng	I could never compete with you.
3729050	eng	I told myself I was in love with you.
3729051	eng	We sympathize with you.
3729052	eng	Tom was so flirting with you.
3729053	eng	Tom was toying with you.
3729054	eng	Tom is toying with you.
3729055	eng	I can't find anything wrong with you.
3729056	eng	That's what's wrong with you.
3729057	eng	I won't go back with you.
3729058	eng	I'm going to get right back with you.
3729059	eng	There's only one problem with you.
3729060	eng	I'm choosing to go with you.
3729061	eng	I can mop the floor with you.
3729062	eng	I'm not going to play guessing games with you.
3729063	eng	We had intended not to meet with you.
3729064	eng	I'm going to be straight with you.
3729065	eng	The manager will be right with you.
3729066	eng	I have to be honest with you.
3729067	eng	I haven't been honest with you.
3729068	eng	I'm going to be very honest with you.
3729069	eng	Tell us what's new with you.
3729070	eng	I suppose I should thank you.
3729071	eng	That's what I'm here to ask you.
3729072	eng	I'm not ashamed to tell you.
3729073	eng	This is why I was afraid to tell you.
3729074	eng	Boy have I got something to tell you.
3729075	eng	I have so much to tell you.
3729076	eng	It would be better for them to tell you.
3729077	eng	I had to wait to tell you.
3729078	eng	These are the things I couldn't tell you.
3729079	eng	It'd kill you.
3729080	eng	I could kill you.
3729081	eng	Give me that or I'll kill you.
3729082	eng	If you don't tell us, we'll kill you.
3729083	eng	Tom is prepared to kill you.
3729084	eng	Tom won't hesitate to kill you.
3729085	eng	I need a good reason not to kill you.
3729086	eng	Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
3729087	eng	It'd be a lot more convincing if it came from you.
3729088	eng	I don't need a sermon from you.
3729089	eng	I need one last favor from you.
3729090	eng	I'm not the one who kept secrets from you.
3729091	eng	I'm telling you this because I don't want to have any secrets from you.
3729092	eng	I want much more than that from you.
3729093	eng	Sorry for keeping it secret from you.
3729094	eng	That's what I want from you.
3729095	eng	I couldn't take money from you.
3729096	eng	I don't wish to harm you.
3729097	eng	I didn't intend to alarm you.
3729098	eng	I don't want to alarm you.
3729099	eng	I didn't mean to demean you.
3729100	eng	Tom has a better work ethic than you.
3729101	eng	I'm happier than you.
3729102	eng	I can hold my liquor better than you.
3729103	eng	I want to assure you that we've not forgotten you.
3729104	eng	I have total confidence in you.
3729105	eng	I didn't think you had it in you.
3729106	eng	Let me entertain you.
3729107	eng	The drinks are on you.
3729108	eng	I'm not here to put pressure on you.
3729109	eng	I checked up on you.
3729110	eng	Please don't make me waste a bullet on you.
3729111	eng	I used to dream about being married to you.
3729112	eng	Tom was nothing compared to you.
3729113	eng	I wanted to be a good friend to you.
3729114	eng	I know this must seem incredible to you.
3729115	eng	Tom really was horrible to you.
3729116	eng	That's why I came to you.
3729117	eng	I'd like to go home if it's all the same to you.
3729118	eng	I know how important your problems are to you.
3729119	eng	See if this makes sense to you.
3729120	eng	I'm feeling really close to you.
3729121	eng	I've never done anything to you.
3729122	eng	Tom wasn't going to do anything to you.
3729123	eng	Hey, lady, we're talking to you.
3729124	eng	Tom, don't walk away when I'm talking to you.
3729125	eng	Tell me why I'm talking to you.
3729126	eng	I certainly don't mind Tom talking to you.
3729127	eng	I guess that wouldn't mean much to you.
3729128	eng	It'll come back to you.
3729129	eng	Let me get back to you.
3729130	eng	I'm going to get right back to you.
3729131	eng	That's why I came to talk to you.
3729132	eng	I can make the time to talk to you.
3729133	eng	I won't let anything bad happen to you.
3729134	eng	I'm very drawn to you.
3729135	eng	I guess that'll be up to you.
3729136	eng	I'll make this up to you.
3729137	eng	I promise I'll make it up to you.
3729138	eng	I'll do anything to make it up to you.
3729139	eng	This will never happen again, I swear to you.
3729140	eng	I guess this still belongs to you.
3729141	eng	I know how this looks to you.
3729142	eng	I want you to think about what really matters to you.
3729143	eng	I just showed it to you.
3729144	eng	Give me a chance to prove it to you.
3729145	eng	I'll have it sent to you.
3729146	eng	Maybe I'll run into you.
3729147	eng	I was totally into you.
3729148	eng	It's going to help you.
3729149	eng	That isn't going to help you.
3729150	eng	I don't know why I bother trying to help you.
3729151	eng	I've instructed Tom to help you.
3729152	eng	I must help you.
3729153	eng	I think everybody's only pretending they don't hear you.
3729154	eng	Let me tell you what I can offer you.
3729155	eng	I don't wish to anger you.
3729156	eng	It's not every day you get a building named after you.
3729157	eng	They even named their boy after you.
3729158	eng	I had a meal prepared for you.
3729159	eng	I got it started for you.
3729160	eng	That can't be good for you.
3729161	eng	I guess that's good for you.
3729162	eng	That shouldn't be hard for you.
3729163	eng	There was a place for you.
3729164	eng	That's gratitude for you.
3729165	eng	Let me make this simple for you.
3729166	eng	That's why I came for you.
3729167	eng	Come by later, I have something for you.
3729168	eng	Perhaps we'll ask Tom to suggest something for you.
3729169	eng	Tom sacrificed everything for you.
3729170	eng	If anything happens to Tom, I'll come looking for you.
3729171	eng	There's a guy downstairs asking for you.
3729172	eng	I'll have lunch waiting for you.
3729173	eng	They'll be rooting for you.
3729174	eng	Now, you let me know if this gets to be too much for you.
3729175	eng	That should be enough for you.
3729176	eng	I can make a phone call for you.
3729177	eng	Tom, there's a telephone call for you.
3729178	eng	That's why I fell for you.
3729179	eng	I'm the only one who can get them for you.
3729180	eng	Just think what it could do for you.
3729181	eng	I'll have Tom bring up some dinner for you.
3729182	eng	That'd be a good color for you.
3729183	eng	I've got real feelings for you.
3729184	eng	I grabbed this for you.
3729185	eng	I can look into this for you.
3729186	eng	I've been waiting in my quarters for you.
3729187	eng	That's why I sent for you.
3729188	eng	They're just for you.
3729189	eng	Tom is just looking out for you.
3729190	eng	I'm sure something will work out for you.
3729191	eng	I don't think I have to spell it out for you.
3729192	eng	I had dinner ready for you.
3729193	eng	I'll make this easy for you.
3729194	eng	I could tutor you.
3729195	eng	You're not fooling anyone, Tom. We know it's you.
3729196	eng	We all can't be as strong as you.
3729197	eng	I don't know if you know this, but I'm not as smart as you.
3729198	eng	I could see it was you.
3729199	eng	I'm sorry if my being here embarrasses you.
3729200	eng	I know the cure for what ails you.
3729201	eng	I'm glad to be the one who tells you.
3729202	eng	I don't know how to address you.
3729203	eng	You're not prepared for what awaits you.
3729204	eng	I'm sorry if I snapped at you.
3729205	eng	I'm surprised at you.
3729206	eng	You said you needed someone to protect you.
3729207	eng	It's a real pleasure to meet you.
3729208	eng	It's a real honor to meet you.
3729209	eng	It's a great honor to meet you.
3729210	eng	It's so good to finally meet you.
3729211	eng	It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
3729212	eng	They're out to get you.
3729213	eng	Sometimes I don't get you.
3729214	eng	I've upset you.
3729215	eng	I never should've left you.
3729216	eng	Hey, Tom, glad I caught you.
3729217	eng	That's why Tom hit you.
3729218	eng	You'll never know what hit you.
3729219	eng	I got you all right where I want you.
3729220	eng	That's why we want you.
3729221	eng	I guess I didn't want to disappoint you.
3729222	eng	I never would've shot you.
3729223	eng	I almost shot you.
3729224	eng	Come any closer, and I'll shoot you.
3729225	eng	I figured it was better not to interrupt you.
3729226	eng	Look, Tom, I'm sorry I hurt you.
3729227	eng	I don't want to do anything that would hurt you.
3729228	eng	We aren't here to hurt you.
3729229	eng	I have no desire to hurt you.
3729230	eng	It can't hurt you.
3729231	eng	Don't think I won't hurt you.
3729232	eng	I'm not going to hold that against you.
3729233	eng	I don't hold that against you.
3729234	eng	I won't hold it against you.
3729235	eng	It'll cost you.
3729236	eng	It's going to cost you.
3729237	eng	That's why I trust you.
3729238	eng	If you don't trust them, they won't trust you.
3729239	eng	I was never worried about you.
3729240	eng	I should've listened to Tom when he warned me about you.
3729241	eng	I never stop thinking about you.
3729242	eng	I'm starting to get a bad feeling about you.
3729243	eng	I'm not writing about you.
3729244	eng	I've read all about you.
3729245	eng	Not everything is about you.
3729246	eng	Tom, this isn't about you.
3729247	eng	I feel the same way about you.
3729248	eng	Tom feels the same way about you.
3729249	eng	That's why I worry about you.
3729250	eng	I couldn't have solved this case without you.
3729251	eng	We're better off without you.
3729252	eng	I figured it was better not to go without you.
3729253	eng	I can do this with you or without you.
3729254	eng	I don't know if I can make it without you.
3729255	eng	I wanted you the moment I saw you.
3729256	eng	I knew I wanted you the moment I saw you.
3729257	eng	Hey, Tom, you've gotten a lot taller since I last saw you.
3729258	eng	I have so much to show you.
3729259	eng	They just want to get to know you.
3729260	eng	I don't need to be lectured by you.
3729261	eng	I'm still intimidated by you.
3729262	eng	We aren't here to destroy you.
3729263	eng	I have to say I envy you.
3729264	eng	You nearly broke my jaw.
3729265	eng	It's against the law.
3729266	eng	That's not what I saw.
3729267	eng	Tom was surprised by something he saw.
3729268	eng	Tom liked what he saw.
3729269	eng	Tom seems to have a different point to view.
3729270	eng	I told you everything I knew.
3729271	eng	My condolences to you and your crew.
3729272	eng	Tom bowed and withdrew.
3729273	eng	Tom propped himself up on his elbow.
3729274	eng	You and I both know you were the one who broke the window.
3729275	eng	Tom crossed to the window.
3729276	eng	Tom went and shut the window.
3729277	eng	I'm going to find out who broke this window.
3729278	eng	I'll make myself useful somehow.
3729279	eng	You're missing the late show.
3729280	eng	You should have your own talk show.
3729281	eng	You were a no show.
3729282	eng	Tom's irritation is starting to show.
3729283	eng	I'm surprised Tom didn't show.
3729284	eng	It's our only show.
3729285	eng	Please tell me you're not buying this dog and pony show.
3729286	eng	Keep your head low.
3729287	eng	Tom is an eccentric fellow.
3729288	eng	It's excruciatingly slow.
3729289	eng	Leave this area now.
3729290	eng	We're as good as dead now.
3729291	eng	Tom is confined to bed now.
3729292	eng	That's all changed now.
3729293	eng	It's finished now.
3729294	eng	Tom is dead and buried now.
3729295	eng	You can get dressed now.
3729296	eng	I need to get started now.
3729297	eng	We're not ready to have a kid now.
3729298	eng	I want you focus on the here and now.
3729299	eng	You can't change your mind now.
3729300	eng	I'm done fooling around now.
3729301	eng	If you're ever going to help us with this, it has to be now.
3729302	eng	It's got to be now.
3729303	eng	Tom is at peace now.
3729304	eng	We're on the same page now.
3729305	eng	We're totally different people now.
3729306	eng	You'll come with me now.
3729307	eng	We have a bit of time now.
3729308	eng	My computer works fine now.
3729309	eng	I want guards posted here and I want them here now.
3729310	eng	I get the picture now.
3729311	eng	You're part of the gang now.
3729312	eng	The air conditioner seems to be working now.
3729313	eng	It seems to be working now.
3729314	eng	They're bringing him in for questioning now.
3729315	eng	I think everybody should stand back now.
3729316	eng	I'm in the mood to talk now.
3729317	eng	That's how I feel now.
3729318	eng	I don't need to see Tom now.
3729319	eng	We have to spend time with Tom now.
3729320	eng	That doesn't mean you should tell Tom now.
3729321	eng	You should get your money from Tom now.
3729322	eng	I'm going to make my own decisions from now.
3729323	eng	I'm going to advise you to just listen now.
3729324	eng	I'm seeking a solution even now.
3729325	eng	I need your full attention now.
3729326	eng	Tom has got my full attention now.
3729327	eng	You have to leave Boston now.
3729328	eng	Tom isn't about to back down now.
3729329	eng	Unless you have any more questions, I'd like to go now.
3729330	eng	I'm going to hang up now.
3729331	eng	We're all in this together now.
3729332	eng	I'm hanging in there for now.
3729333	eng	We'll go with that for now.
3729334	eng	Tom seems to understand where he stands now.
3729335	ukr	Ви танцювали.
3729336	eng	I've failed Tom so many times now.
3729337	eng	I need to end this now.
3729338	eng	I insist that we do this now.
3729339	eng	Let's do this now.
3729340	eng	It would be prudent to worry about the details now.
3729341	eng	I'd like to get Tom behind bars now.
3729342	eng	I don't see that it matters now.
3729343	eng	Tom has been in there for almost three hours now.
3729344	eng	The machine's yours now.
3729345	eng	I'm opening my presents now.
3729346	eng	Tom is calling the shots now.
3729347	eng	I can see that now.
3729348	eng	I really don't recommend doing that now.
3729349	eng	I'm not saying I want to do that now.
3729350	eng	It's a bit late for that now.
3729351	eng	Tom is just trying to get your goat now.
3729352	eng	I think this is beside the point, right now.
3729353	eng	We're in a dangerous area right now.
3729354	eng	I can't be bothered right now.
3729355	eng	I'm not saying you have to explain it all to me right now.
3729356	eng	I've been where you are right now.
3729357	eng	I just don't care right now.
3729358	eng	I'm coming up there right now.
3729359	eng	I'm on my way to the meeting right now.
3729360	eng	We have a few pressing issues to deal right now.
3729361	eng	You don't want to be in Boston right now.
3729362	eng	I've never needed a friend more than I do right now.
3729363	eng	I'm in no mood to argue politics right now.
3729364	eng	I don't feel like sorting clothes right now.
3729365	eng	I'm not sure if I'm ready to talk about this right now.
3729366	eng	I can't be distracted by this right now.
3729367	eng	Tom is the least of my problems right now.
3729368	eng	We're actually researching that right now.
3729369	eng	I really can't comment on that right now.
3729370	eng	I'm in no mood to do that right now.
3729371	eng	I need to see a copy of it right now.
3729372	eng	I don't think I could explain it right now.
3729373	eng	That's what Tom's trying to figure out right now.
3729374	eng	This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about right now.
3729375	eng	That's all I know right now.
3729376	eng	Tom is meeting with Mary right now.
3729377	eng	Tom is going into surgery right now.
3729378	eng	Tom is alright now.
3729379	eng	We're in for it now.
3729380	eng	We're serious about it now.
3729381	eng	I'm practically an adult now.
3729382	eng	It's so different now.
3729383	eng	Nobody can keep us apart now.
3729384	eng	I'm practically an expert now.
3729385	eng	I'm very unhappy just now.
3729386	eng	I think we've got it worked out now.
3729387	eng	I think we've got it figured out now.
3729388	eng	It's all behind you now.
3729389	eng	No one's going to save you now.
3729390	eng	I'm afraid even your friends can't save you now.
3729391	eng	I don't think there's any harm in telling you now.
3729392	eng	I could kill you now.
3729393	eng	I'm coming to you now.
3729394	eng	I think that's up to you now.
3729395	eng	If you have a problem with any of this, I need to know now.
3729396	eng	I meant to have that done by now.
3729397	eng	According to his schedule, Tom should've been here by now.
3729398	eng	I thought that was obvious by now.
3729399	eng	You must realize that by now.
3729400	eng	Tom knows better than that by now.
3729401	eng	Tom should've been in contact by now.
3729402	eng	Tom is a little creepy now.
3729403	eng	Tom is one of the most decent men I know.
3729404	eng	I don't know what I know.
3729405	eng	I don't know how I know.
3729406	eng	There's something I feel you should know.
3729407	eng	We'll soon learn all we need to know.
3729408	eng	I already know what I wanted to know.
3729409	eng	I was ready to tell Tom anything he wanted to know.
3729410	eng	You'd be the one to know.
3729411	eng	It's not like Tom is going to know.
3729412	eng	They know things these people want to know.
3729413	eng	Now tell us what we want to know.
3729414	eng	Trust me, you don't want to know.
3729415	eng	I can ask Tom if you really want to know.
3729416	eng	That's why I wanted you to know.
3729417	eng	I guess we'll never know.
3729418	eng	Tell me something interesting about Tom that I don't know.
3729419	eng	I could get you fired, you know.
3729420	eng	You don't fool me, you know.
3729421	eng	We've got a situation here, you know.
3729422	eng	Tom is out of control, you know.
3729423	eng	I could really make things hard for you, you know.
3729424	eng	I could really mess things up for you, you know.
3729425	eng	You're wiser than you know.
3729426	eng	Well, tell me what you know.
3729427	eng	Let's go over what we already know.
3729428	eng	I don't rightly know.
3729429	eng	The path was narrow.
3729430	eng	Tom said he'll pick you up from practice tomorrow.
3729431	eng	Tom is sure to come tomorrow.
3729432	eng	We won't get to you until tomorrow.

3729436	eng	I'm going to use it tomorrow.
3729437	eng	I'll have it here for you tomorrow.
3729438	eng	You should be out of here by tomorrow.

3729577	eng	Tom is acting very strange today.
3729578	eng	Tom is going to die today.
3729579	eng	I don't have any money on me today.
3729580	eng	I'm having a very difficult time today.
3729581	eng	I know you're not yourself today.
3729582	eng	You've taken a big step today.
3729583	eng	I heard you really screwed up today.
3729584	eng	We're expecting lousy weather today.
3729585	eng	That's plenty for today.
3729586	eng	I know I've said some pretty stupid things today.
3729587	eng	Tom made the company what it is today.
3729588	eng	We have a new student joining our class today.
3729589	eng	Tom is in high spirits today.
3729590	eng	I really don't recommend that today.
3729591	eng	I meant to cancel your appointment today.
3729592	eng	I feel different today.
3729593	eng	I feel funny today.
3729594	eng	The most amazing thing happened yesterday.
3729595	eng	I'm quite certain Tom was here yesterday.
3729596	eng	Tom was in perfect health yesterday.
3729597	eng	Tom showed me his garden yesterday.
3729598	eng	You were such a big help yesterday.
3729599	eng	We'll make our announcement on Thursday.
3729600	eng	I'm going to hit the hay.
3729601	eng	The organ started to play.
3729602	eng	We have the whole summer to play.
3729603	eng	This is child's play.
3729604	eng	We offered Tom a month's severance pay.
3729605	eng	There's a small price to pay.
3729606	eng	That's an awfully high price to ask someone to pay.
3729607	eng	That's the price you pay.
3729608	eng	Maybe we should pray.
3729609	eng	Tom began to pray.
3729610	eng	It's just pepper spray.
3729611	eng	You'll do exactly as I say.
3729612	eng	That's what you should say.
3729613	eng	Tom said you have the final say.
3729614	eng	There's nothing more Tom can say.
3729615	eng	Tom hasn't said anything he wasn't supposed to say.
3729616	eng	I'll say what I have to say.
3729617	eng	Tom was trying to think of the right thing to say.
3729618	eng	Tom never listens to what I'm trying to say.
3729619	eng	That's what I'm trying to say.
3729620	eng	I have so much to say.
3729621	eng	My real dad wouldn't tell me what to say.
3729622	eng	That's kind of you to say.
3729623	eng	That's nice of you to say.
3729624	eng	That's easy enough for you to say.
3729625	eng	That isn't for you to say.
3729626	eng	Tom said that you said something I know you would never say.
3729627	eng	I don't care what the regulations say.
3729628	eng	That's exactly the kind of thing I don't want to hear you say.
3729629	eng	It's as you say.
3729630	eng	You know what they say.
3729631	eng	It would mean a great deal to me if you would stay.
3729632	eng	That doesn't mean I can stay.
3729633	eng	We'll get you a place to stay.
3729634	eng	It means a lot to me to know that you want me to stay.
3729635	eng	Tom didn't care to stay.
3729636	eng	Let's just say I'm here to stay.
3729637	eng	I can't possibly stay.
3729638	eng	I'll be with you every step of the way.
3729639	eng	Something tells me we're in the way.
3729640	eng	It's on the way.
3729641	eng	I've been feeling the same way.
3729642	eng	You'd feel the same way.
3729643	eng	We go back a long way.
3729644	eng	You and Tom go back a long way.
3729645	eng	I pay my own way.
3729646	eng	I don't mind either way.
3729647	eng	We've gone miles out of our way.
3729648	eng	Tell me you're on your way.
3729649	eng	That's the problem with doing things your way.
3729650	eng	Tom was in Mary's way.
3729651	eng	They're headed this way.
3729652	eng	I'm sorry it had to be done this way.
3729653	eng	Thanks for coming all this way.
3729654	eng	I truly didn't know you felt this way.
3729655	eng	I think they went this way.
3729656	eng	It's on its way.
3729657	eng	Pizza is on its way.
3729658	eng	I don't know why I reacted that way.
3729659	eng	Tom didn't deserve to die that way.
3729660	eng	You can't talk to me that way.
3729661	eng	You don't talk to me that way.
3729662	eng	You'll never escape that way.
3729663	eng	It doesn't look that way.
3729664	eng	Hey, it doesn't work that way.
3729665	eng	I told Tom that he was a fool to let Mary talk to him that way.
3729666	eng	You've always been that way.
3729667	eng	I don't think about you in that way.
3729668	eng	It certainly looks that way.
3729669	eng	I don't think it works that way.
3729670	eng	I can't have you talking to the customers that way.
3729671	eng	You can't talk to us that way.
3729672	eng	I'm sure Tom didn't see it that way.
3729673	eng	Please don't think of it that way.
3729674	eng	I hadn't thought of it that way.
3729675	eng	You can't get out that way.
3729676	eng	I prefer that it stay that way.
3729677	eng	Tom is kind of crazy that way.
3729678	eng	I finally feel like everything's going my way.
3729679	eng	I'm expected to overcome all obstacles in my way.
3729680	eng	I'm glad they see it my way.
3729681	eng	I had some cash stashed away.
3729682	eng	I have some cash stashed away.
3729683	eng	The laughter died away.
3729684	eng	Tom hurried away.
3729685	eng	Tom blushed and turned away.
3729686	eng	They'll take me away.
3729687	eng	You'll give me away.
3729688	eng	I couldn't bring myself to throw your picture away.
3729689	eng	The bank is trying to take Tom's house away.
3729690	eng	You'll give yourself away.
3729691	eng	You've already given yourself away.
3729692	eng	You never want to give anything away.
3729693	eng	Tom doesn't want to give anything away.
3729694	eng	We don't want to give too much away.
3729695	eng	You take my breath away.
3729696	eng	Just let me walk away.
3729697	eng	I know it's hard to walk away.
3729698	eng	Tom said I should just walk away.
3729699	eng	I'm going to scare Tom away.
3729700	eng	Tom was shot trying to run away.
3729701	eng	It'll go away.
3729702	eng	I just want my past to go away.
3729703	eng	I can make this go away.
3729704	eng	Tom wouldn't go away.
3729705	eng	I said step away.
3729706	eng	You seem a million miles away.
3729707	eng	Tom's laughing could be heard three blocks away.
3729708	eng	You both need to get away.
3729709	eng	I just wanted to get away.
3729710	eng	Tom had trouble sleeping when you went away.
3729711	eng	You should be put away.
3729712	eng	This will blow you away.
3729713	eng	Tom helped me to clear snow away.
3729714	eng	Tom just can't stay away.
3729715	eng	Tom was trying to give his money away.
3729716	eng	Tom made a clean getaway.
3729717	eng	Get on the freeway.
3729718	eng	They met each other halfway.
3729719	eng	Tom didn't belong here anyway.
3729720	eng	They'd find a way to do whatever they want to do anyway.
3729721	eng	Tom didn't pay me enough for that anyway.
3729722	eng	Tom, I know this is an unfair question, but I'm going to ask it anyway.
3729723	eng	Nice of you to drop by.
3729724	eng	You just worry about taking care of your baby.
3729725	eng	Seriously, Tom, you need a hobby.
3729726	eng	I got to be pretty good at rugby.
3729727	eng	Tom is afraid of intimacy.
3729728	eng	Tom is a stickler for accuracy.
3729729	eng	I've arranged for a bit of privacy.
3729730	eng	Don't make me change that policy.
3729731	eng	Tom has had a medical emergency.
3729732	eng	You said there was an emergency.
3729733	eng	Tom had a family emergency.
3729734	eng	I'm at your mercy.
3729735	eng	I can look at it when you're ready.
3729736	eng	I have to get Tom's lunch ready.
3729737	eng	Nothing has to happen until you're ready.
3729738	eng	You're just in time. Tom is almost ready.
3729739	eng	I can feel my pulse quickening already.
3729740	eng	Come in already.
3729741	eng	You have my attention already.
3729742	eng	I'm practically an adult already.
3729743	eng	Tom was saddened by the tragedy.
3729744	eng	It'll come in handy.
3729745	eng	I figured this might come in handy.
3729746	eng	Keep your gun handy.
3729747	eng	Tom doesn't have a mean bone in his body.
3729748	eng	I'd like to do an autopsy on this body.
3729749	eng	You could've killed somebody.
3729750	eng	Tom has got nobody.
3729751	eng	I never murdered anybody.
3729752	eng	I've never actually tortured anybody.
3729753	eng	It could be anybody.
3729754	eng	Tom realized he wasn't convincing anybody.
3729755	eng	It's all right, I won't tell anybody.
3729756	eng	I know that better than anybody.
3729757	eng	I didn't mean to usurp anybody.
3729758	eng	That can't be good for anybody.
3729759	eng	Tom didn't visit anybody.
3729760	eng	Get up, everybody.
3729761	eng	I think I've found enough for everybody.
3729762	eng	They've taken Tom into protective custody.
3729763	eng	We're going to try to get you full custody.
3729764	eng	I'm releasing Tom into your custody.
3729765	eng	I've been watching you study.
3729766	eng	Let me get you the key.
3729767	eng	Tom let himself in with his own key.
3729768	eng	Tom let himself into the house with his key.
3729769	eng	Tom began to carve the turkey.
3729770	eng	I hope you bought us a big enough turkey.
3729771	eng	Tom said this is up your alley.
3729772	eng	I could sure use that reward money.
3729773	eng	We're doing this for the money.
3729774	eng	We're not doing this for the money.
3729775	eng	We can make some money.
3729776	eng	Tom made a bunch of money.
3729777	eng	Tom says you won a whole bunch of money.
3729778	eng	Green is the color of money.
3729779	eng	Tom made his company lots of money.
3729780	eng	I really don't have a lot of money.
3729781	eng	I know it's a lot of money.
3729782	eng	I never needed that much money.
3729783	eng	I assure you this is about much more than money.
3729784	eng	I want to see if I can find out where Tom hid the stolen money.
3729785	eng	I could sure use that scholarship money.
3729786	eng	I'm not asking for money.
3729787	eng	We're not really asking for money.
3729788	eng	Tom is always hitting me up for money.
3729789	eng	You're not laying one finger on Tom's money.
3729790	eng	You wanted to get your hands on Tom's money.
3729791	eng	We make great money.
3729792	eng	I could sure use that money.
3729793	eng	Not everything's about money.
3729794	eng	Not everything is about money.
3729795	eng	I assure you this isn't just about money.
3729796	eng	You gave me quite a run for my money.
3729797	eng	You never have any money.
3729798	eng	Tom is an excellent attorney.
3729799	eng	I hope they have a pleasant journey.
3729800	eng	I really appreciate your willingness to testify.
3729801	eng	Tom is still pretty groggy.
3729802	eng	This is no time to quibble over terminology.
3729803	eng	It'll help you save energy.
3729804	eng	They were wealthy.
3729805	eng	Tom doesn't seem particularly trustworthy.
3729806	eng	I want to know how this happened and why.
3729807	eng	That still leaves us with the question of why.
3729808	eng	We never learned what happened or why.
3729809	eng	You said you figured out why.
3729810	eng	I'll tell you why.
3729811	eng	I couldn't tell you why.
3729812	eng	Next time, you won't be so lucky.
3729813	eng	I never thought I'd get that lucky.
3729814	eng	I couldn't get that lucky.
3729815	eng	Tom smiled affably.
3729816	eng	Tom smiled amiably.
3729817	eng	Tom cried uncontrollably.
3729818	eng	Tom smiled and laughed uncomfortably.
3729819	eng	Tom smiled uncomfortably.
3729820	eng	Tom fidgeted uncomfortably.
3729821	eng	Tom is looking weak and wobbly.
3729822	eng	Tom nodded his head almost imperceptibly.
3729823	eng	Tom is at the general assembly.
3729824	eng	Tom smiled humbly.
3729825	eng	I had no idea Tom would take it so badly.
3729826	eng	Tom left the room hurriedly.
3729827	eng	Tom laughed good-naturedly.
3729828	eng	Tom smiled halfheartedly.
3729829	eng	Tom sighed profoundly.
3729830	eng	Tom smiled awkwardly.
3729831	eng	Tom smiled inwardly.
3729832	eng	Tom applauded loudly.
3729833	eng	I think this will do nicely.
3729834	eng	I just want to get Tom home safely.
3729835	eng	It seemed likely.
3729836	eng	That would seem likely.
3729837	eng	It seems likely.
3729838	eng	I'm not saying that we can't win. I'm just saying it's not likely.
3729839	eng	Tom looked at them closely.
3729840	eng	Tom looked at Mary closely.
3729841	eng	I want my money returned immediately.
3729842	eng	I don't know why you didn't tell me immediately.
3729843	eng	We'll get you back home immediately.
3729844	eng	I insist that we leave immediately.
3729845	eng	It's you who've acted inappropriately.
3729846	eng	Tom is just a little stressed lately.
3729847	eng	Tom has been a little unapproachable lately.
3729848	eng	Tom has been awfully distant lately.
3729849	eng	I'm hearing that a lot lately.
3729850	eng	Tom took Mary into his arms, and they kissed each other passionately.
3729851	eng	Tom changed his attitude completely.
3729852	eng	I've forgotten Tom completely.
3729853	eng	Tom smiled politely.
3729854	eng	Tom grimaced bravely.
3729855	eng	Tom smiled bravely.
3729856	eng	Tom looked at Mary apprehensively.
3729857	eng	Tom smiled appreciatively.
3729858	eng	That'll never fly.
3729859	eng	That won't fly.
3729860	eng	Tom smiled briefly.
3729861	eng	Tom smiled admiringly.
3729862	eng	Tom looked at Mary inquiringly.
3729863	eng	Tom smiled approvingly.
3729864	eng	Tom smiled knowingly.
3729865	eng	It's getting ugly.
3729866	eng	It's going to get ugly.
3729867	eng	This might get ugly.
3729868	eng	It might get ugly.
3729869	eng	This just got ugly.
3729870	eng	You said you wanted a family.
3729871	eng	Tom is an old acquaintance of the family.
3729872	eng	Tom has something for the entire family.
3729873	eng	I just thought that you might want to go home and be with your family.
3729874	eng	You belong at home with your family.
3729875	eng	Think about your family.
3729876	eng	Tom is a disgrace to his family.
3729877	eng	Tom is supported by his family.
3729878	eng	I'm still part of this family.
3729879	eng	I have to be there for my family.
3729880	eng	I let my guard down momentarily.
3729881	eng	Tom clenched his fists angrily.
3729882	eng	Tom looked at Mary uneasily.
3729883	eng	Tom smiled guiltily.
3729884	eng	It's not something I can decide quickly.
3729885	eng	Tom turned the page quickly.
3729886	eng	I can get us there more quickly.
3729887	eng	Tom needs to think of a solution quickly.
3729888	eng	Tom got up quickly.
3729889	eng	Tom closed his eyes quickly.
3729890	eng	Tom looked at Mary quickly.
3729891	eng	I need to get something done very quickly.
3729892	eng	Tom stared at Mary blankly.
3729893	eng	Tom was laughing hysterically.
3729894	eng	Tom smiled skeptically.
3729895	eng	Tom was put to death finally.
3729896	eng	Don't take it so personally.
3729897	eng	Don't take this personally.
3729898	eng	It feels silly.
3729899	eng	I suppose it was a bit silly.
3729900	eng	The sail won't open fully.
3729901	eng	Tom looks as if he's sleeping peacefully.
3729902	eng	Tom slept peacefully.
3729903	eng	I could've warned Tom more forcefully.
3729904	eng	Tom smiled hopefully.
3729905	eng	Tom prepared his speech very carefully.
3729906	eng	Tom smiled gratefully.
3729907	eng	Tom performed his duties faithfully.
3729908	eng	Tom smiled thoughtfully.
3729909	eng	The two brothers embraced warmly.
3729910	eng	Tom smiled warmly.
3729911	eng	Tom shut the door gently but firmly.
3729912	eng	The door opened suddenly.
3729913	eng	Tom woke up quite suddenly.
3729914	eng	Tom could see it plainly.
3729915	eng	Tom sighed deeply.
3729916	eng	Tom didn't attempt to reply.
3729917	eng	Tom looked at Mary sharply.
3729918	eng	I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
3729919	eng	I came in early.
3729920	eng	Tom discreetly left the party early.
3729921	eng	Tom smiled eagerly.
3729922	eng	I haven't had time to thank you properly.
3729923	eng	Tom cried bitterly.
3729924	eng	Tom smiled helplessly.
3729925	eng	Tom slept restlessly.
3729926	eng	You'll enjoy it tremendously.
3729928	eng	We've got to talk seriously.
3729929	eng	Tom seemed to take the matter seriously.
3729930	eng	Tom watched curiously.
3729931	eng	Tom glanced at Mary curiously.
3729932	eng	Tom looked at Mary curiously.
3729933	eng	We waited anxiously.
3729934	eng	You do like living dangerously.
3729935	eng	Tom looked at Mary contemptuously.
3729936	eng	Tom frowned nervously.
3729937	eng	Tom cleared his throat nervously.
3729938	ukr	Вона точно була як дитина. Вона хотіла бути завжди зі мною.

3729941	ukr	Тридцять нот в секунду ?! Так як таке взагалі можливо?
3729942	ukr	Він був так приголомшений побаченим, що ніби всі слова забув.
3729943	ukr	Повірити не можу, що Тому вдалося піти живим.
3729944	ukr	Можливо, ти лише бачиш те, що хочеш бачити.
3729945	ukr	Це було велике видовище.
3729946	ukr	Воно все спрацює, ось побачите.
3729947	ukr	Я зробив те, що ви хотіли, щоб я зробив.
3729948	ukr	Напевно, тому.

3729989	eng	Tom ate quietly.
3729990	eng	Tom came into the room quietly.

3730006	eng	Tom smiled expectantly.
3730007	eng	Tom smiled hesitantly.
3730008	eng	Tom's smile vanished instantly.
3730009	eng	That's the only residential building in Boston that's been torn down recently.
3730010	eng	Tom smiled innocently.
3730011	eng	Tom waited obediently.
3730012	eng	I'll wait patiently.
3730013	eng	Tom is tapping his foot impatiently.
3730014	eng	Tom coughed violently.
3730015	eng	I think Tom feels differently.
3730016	eng	Tom looked at Mary intently.
3730017	eng	Tom smiled faintly.
3730018	eng	Our guests will be leaving shortly.
3730019	eng	We'll be making an announcement shortly.
3730020	eng	It should be ready shortly.
3730021	eng	Tom nodded curtly.
3730022	eng	You look positively ghastly.
3730023	eng	The door closed slowly.
3730024	eng	Tom sipped his wine slowly.
3730025	eng	Know your enemy.
3730026	eng	Tom was drafted into the army.
3730027	eng	That's as good a place as any.
3730028	eng	This is as good place to die as any.
3730029	eng	That's as good a way to die as any.
3730030	eng	I suppose this is as good a time as any.
3730031	eng	That's as good an explanation as any.
3730032	eng	That's as good a reason as any.
3730033	eng	There are so many.
3730034	eng	I don't think I'd be very good company.
3730035	eng	I suppose I could use the company.
3730036	eng	Tom is the majority shareholder in the company.
3730037	eng	Tom is joining our company.
3730038	eng	You control your destiny.
3730039	eng	It was worth every penny.
3730040	eng	Normally this would be funny.
3730041	eng	This is no time to be funny.
3730042	eng	That's real funny.
3730043	eng	Tom is real funny.
3730044	eng	Tom was writhing in agony.
3730045	eng	Tom said he was three months behind on alimony.
3730046	eng	Tom recanted his testimony.
3730047	eng	Tom was always a mama's boy.
3730048	eng	Tom is jumping up and down with joy.
3730049	eng	Tom couldn't contain his joy.
3730050	eng	It's time for your therapy.
3730051	eng	Tom was getting sleepy.
3730052	eng	I'm so sleepy.
3730053	eng	Tom was tired, but not sleepy.
3730054	eng	I thought it was creepy.
3730055	eng	Tom wasn't quite happy.
3730056	eng	Tom is going to make us very happy.
3730057	eng	Tom was suddenly very happy.
3730058	eng	Maybe Tom is getting sloppy.
3730059	eng	Tom was suspected of being a spy.
3730060	eng	Tom pitied Mary.
3730061	eng	Tom confronted Mary.
3730062	eng	Tom eyed Mary.
3730063	eng	We're investigating the deaths of Tom and Mary.
3730064	eng	It was for Tom and Mary.
3730065	eng	I don't think it was Tom and Mary.
3730066	eng	Tom followed closely behind Mary.
3730067	eng	Tom gently put his arms around Mary.
3730068	eng	Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
3730069	eng	Tom could see Mary.
3730070	eng	Maybe that's why Tom wants to see Mary.
3730071	eng	Tom reluctantly went to see Mary.
3730072	eng	The last thing Tom wants to do is see Mary.
3730073	eng	Tom couldn't help but like Mary.
3730074	eng	I understand why Tom would want to phone Mary.
3730075	eng	Tom threatened to leave Mary.
3730076	eng	Tom started making fun of Mary.
3730077	eng	Tom frequently thought of Mary.
3730078	eng	Tom put some food in front of Mary.
3730079	eng	Tom sat facing Mary.
3730080	eng	Tom had no intention of harming Mary.
3730081	eng	Just tell Tom to stop kissing Mary.
3730082	eng	Tom couldn't bear the thought of leaving Mary.
3730083	eng	Tom is obviously infatuated with Mary.
3730084	eng	Tom made peace with Mary.
3730085	eng	There's no way I'm going to dance with Mary.
3730086	eng	Tom said he'd been spending a lot of time with Mary.
3730087	eng	Tom seems to get along fine with Mary.
3730088	eng	Tom was deeply in love with Mary.
3730089	eng	Tom is hopelessly in love with Mary.
3730090	eng	Tom is conferring with Mary.
3730091	eng	I should've anticipated that Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
3730092	eng	Tom got into the elevator with Mary.
3730093	eng	I've never seen Tom as happy as he was with Mary.
3730094	eng	Tom never bothered to tell Mary.
3730095	eng	Tom has no other choice but to tell Mary.
3730096	eng	Tom planned to kill Mary.
3730097	eng	They ordered Tom to kill Mary.
3730098	eng	Tom looked away from Mary.
3730099	eng	Tom is significantly younger than Mary.
3730100	eng	I'm not sure what Tom sees in Mary.
3730101	eng	I can't imagine what Tom sees in Mary.
3730102	eng	Tom has lost interest in Mary.
3730103	eng	Tom kept his gun trained on Mary.
3730104	eng	Tom's attention remained focused on Mary.
3730105	eng	Tom didn't want to give a definite answer until he talked to Mary.
3730106	eng	Tom isn't coming, according to Mary.
3730107	eng	It's obvious that Tom isn't talking to Mary.
3730108	eng	Tom wasn't listening to Mary.
3730109	eng	Only Tom can talk to Mary.
3730110	eng	Tom looked familiar to Mary.
3730111	eng	Tom took a few steps closer to Mary.
3730112	eng	Tom crept closer to Mary.
3730113	eng	Tom raised his glass to Mary.
3730114	eng	Tom offered his glass to Mary.
3730115	eng	Tom handed it to Mary.
3730116	eng	Tom pulled something out of his pocket and showed it to Mary.
3730117	eng	Look, Tom, I know you gave it to Mary.
3730118	eng	If Tom could've been here, it would've meant a lot to Mary.
3730119	eng	Tom slumped down next to Mary.
3730120	eng	Tom slid into the seat next to Mary.
3730121	eng	I just thought Tom might talk some sense into Mary.
3730122	eng	Tom is there to help Mary.
3730123	eng	Tom could do nothing to help Mary.
3730124	eng	Tom won't let me anywhere near Mary.
3730125	eng	Tom kicked the stool out from under Mary.
3730126	eng	I've always had a thing for Mary.
3730127	eng	It looks like Tom has a thing for Mary.
3730128	eng	Nobody was good enough for Mary.
3730129	eng	Tom has developed feelings for Mary.
3730130	eng	Tom has feelings for Mary.
3730131	eng	Tom's last girlfriend was Mary.
3730132	eng	You should've told Tom your name was Mary.
3730134	eng	I think Tom even likes Mary.
3730135	eng	Tom leaned in to kiss Mary.
3730136	eng	Tom looked questioningly at Mary.
3730137	eng	Tom turned to look at Mary.
3730138	eng	Tom stopped reading his book and looked up at Mary.
3730139	eng	Tom looked up at Mary.
3730140	eng	Tom looked sideways at Mary.
3730141	eng	Tom looked anxiously at Mary.
3730142	eng	Tom took out his gun and shot Mary.
3730143	eng	I lied every time Tom asked me about Mary.
3730144	eng	I knew Tom was wrong about Mary.
3730145	eng	Tom was right about Mary.
3730146	eng	Tom was distracted by Mary.
3730147	eng	Tom is being interviewed by Mary.
3730148	eng	Tom opened the diary.
3730149	eng	Tom is content with his present salary.
3730150	eng	Tom isn't content with his present salary.
3730151	eng	Tom is a visionary.
3730152	eng	Tom spent no more money than was necessary.
3730153	eng	Tom left us high and dry.
3730154	eng	Tom was sent to jail for the robbery.
3730155	eng	It's not brain surgery.
3730156	eng	Tom told me that he had bigger fish to fry.
3730157	eng	Tom has bigger fish to fry.
3730158	eng	Tom seems more surprised than angry.
3730159	eng	They grew angry.
3730160	eng	Tom will never have to worry about going hungry.
3730161	eng	Tom felt himself getting hungry.
3730162	eng	Tom was suddenly very hungry.
3730163	eng	That's quite a theory.
3730164	eng	I hope you'll find this office satisfactory.
3730165	eng	I thought Tom's performance was satisfactory.
3730166	eng	It's a very small price for such an important victory.
3730167	eng	This is dangerous territory.
3730168	eng	Hey, it's just a story.
3730169	eng	Tom patiently waited for Mary to finish her story.
3730170	eng	They want to tell you their story.
3730171	eng	I'm not buying your story.
3730172	eng	Tom told us his story.
3730173	eng	That's a different story.
3730174	eng	I told Tom my story.
3730175	eng	Tom isn't being entirely truthful about his job history.
3730176	eng	I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry.
3730177	eng	Tom will be so sorry.
3730178	eng	I'm not buying you another drink until you say sorry.
3730179	eng	If I've misjudged you, I'm terribly sorry.
3730180	eng	I just didn't want you to worry.
3730181	eng	There wasn't any special hurry.
3730182	eng	If you're going to do this, you'd better hurry.
3730183	eng	You better hurry.
3730184	eng	Someday you should give it a try.
3730185	eng	We can make it if we try.
3730186	eng	That's good for a first try.
3730187	eng	My picture's in every police station in the country.
3730188	eng	Tom seems to have left the country.
3730189	eng	I'm considered a traitor to this country.
3730190	eng	You're making this too easy.
3730191	eng	Life could be so easy.
3730192	eng	Thank you for making it so easy.
3730193	eng	You're not making this easy.
3730194	eng	Tom isn't getting off that easy.
3730195	eng	I felt very uneasy.
3730196	eng	It's a bit flimsy.
3730197	eng	People are getting antsy.
3730198	eng	I should've guessed you'd be busy.
3730199	eng	People like you are never busy.
3730200	eng	Like I said, I was busy.
3730201	eng	I would think you have other things to keep you busy.
3730202	eng	This is for your own safety.
3730203	eng	We're concerned for your safety.
3730204	eng	There's no reason for you to fear for your safety.
3730205	eng	I was worried for Tom's safety.
3730206	eng	You're personally responsible for Tom's safety.
3730207	eng	Everyone is getting fidgety.
3730208	eng	Tom is a danger to society.
3730209	eng	You're a big softy.
3730210	eng	We're safer here than we would be in a city.
3730211	eng	I heard Tom hates publicity.
3730212	eng	You don't have to worry about publicity.
3730213	eng	Tom does have one redeeming quality.
3730214	eng	It's a huge responsibility.
3730215	eng	I've never been able to handle responsibility.
3730216	eng	Tom hadn't considered that possibility.
3730217	eng	I'm sensing a lot of hostility.
3730218	eng	Have a little dignity.
3730219	eng	Tom has immunity.
3730220	eng	Tom was a native of Boston with deep roots in the community.
3730221	eng	It's a remarkable opportunity.
3730222	eng	You had plenty of opportunity.
3730223	eng	I'm giving you an opportunity.
3730224	eng	I know it's a great opportunity.
3730225	eng	Tom thinks I'm missing this great opportunity.
3730226	eng	You may have that opportunity.
3730227	eng	I regret losing that opportunity.
3730228	eng	I have a problem dealing with authority.
3730229	eng	I didn't mean to challenge your authority.
3730230	eng	Tom is a psychology major at a major university.
3730231	eng	I admire their ingenuity.
3730232	eng	Tom is supposed to be guilty.
3730233	eng	I think someone stole all these things and planted them to make me look guilty.
3730234	eng	I don't feel that guilty.
3730235	eng	We find the defendant not guilty.
3730236	eng	I'll see you in twenty.
3730237	eng	I couldn't live with that kind of uncertainty.
3730238	eng	The roads were empty.
3730239	eng	Tom's cup was empty.
3730240	eng	The street was very empty.
3730241	eng	I'm not in the mood to go to a party.
3730242	eng	Now we've got ourselves a party.
3730243	eng	I'm at an office party.
3730244	eng	I'll throw you a stag party.
3730245	eng	I'll throw you a bachelor party.
3730246	eng	You'll never make it to Tom's party.
3730247	eng	Tom drove all the way from Boston just for my birthday party.
3730248	eng	We have a warrant to search your property.
3730249	eng	It makes me feel dirty.
3730250	eng	That's a funny thing about people like you, you don't want to get your hands dirty.
3730251	eng	You say you don't want to get your hands dirty.
3730252	eng	Tom is still on the right side of thirty.
3730253	eng	This is no time for modesty.
3730254	eng	What's happened here is a travesty.
3730255	eng	I'm so thirsty.
3730256	eng	Tom can be a little chatty.
3730257	eng	Did I tell you I think you're pretty?
3730258	eng	You're so pretty.
3730259	eng	I'm reporting for duty.
3730260	eng	Tom reminded us of our duty.
3730261	eng	I'm going to ask you to do your duty.
3730262	eng	Tom only likes women under thirty or over sixty.
3730263	eng	If you hurry, there still might be some choice items left for you to buy.
3730264	eng	I can tell you're a nice guy.
3730265	eng	You said your boss was a nice guy.
3730266	eng	Tom sounds like a white guy.
3730267	eng	You've got the wrong guy.
3730268	eng	Tom seemed like a good enough guy.
3730269	eng	Tom is a stand up guy.
3730270	eng	I knew something wasn't right about that guy.
3730271	eng	I knew there was something fishy about that guy.
3730272	eng	Tom is a real decent guy.
3730273	eng	Tom was green with envy.
3730274	eng	Tom has been driving me crazy.
3730275	eng	Don't let them tell you you're crazy.
3730276	eng	My parents are crazy.
3730277	eng	Please tell me it's crazy.
3730278	eng	You're the one that went crazy.
3730279	eng	It's normal for you to feel a bit woozy.
3730280	eng	What's happening here at 2:30?
3730281	eng	Where were you on 9/11?
3730282	eng	Are you telling this story or am I?
3730283	eng	I've hurt your feelings, haven't I?
3730284	eng	I'll be OK as long as I stay awake, won't I?
3730285	eng	I just need you to trust me, OK?
3730286	eng	I'm going to be right there, OK?
3730287	eng	Tell Tom I'll just be a minute, OK?
3730288	eng	I don't want you to worry about anything, OK?
3730289	eng	Let me finish, OK?
3730290	eng	If you need something, just ask Tom, OK?
3730291	eng	It scared me, too, OK?
3730292	eng	Don't scare me like that, OK?
3730293	eng	Let's just drop the subject, OK?
3730294	eng	Let's talk this thing out, OK?
3730295	eng	You just have to relax, OK?
3730296	eng	Why all the drama?
3730297	eng	What does that have to do with the price of beans in China?
3730298	eng	How do you feel about opera?
3730299	eng	Are we getting pizza?
3730300	eng	Who picked you for this job?
3730301	eng	Which one of you is the psychic?
3730302	eng	How could anyone not like music?
3730303	eng	Aren't you the romantic?
3730304	eng	Should I feel bad?
3730305	eng	How long has Tom been dead?
3730306	eng	Are you suggesting that Tom isn't dead?
3730307	eng	How come you're not dead?
3730308	eng	Why aren't you dead?
3730309	eng	What would we do instead?
3730310	eng	How many beers have you had?
3730311	eng	How many have you had?
3730312	eng	Did that make Tom mad?
3730313	eng	Did that make you mad?
3730314	eng	Doesn't that strike you as odd?
3730315	eng	How would you like us to proceed?
3730316	eng	Is it time you need?
3730317	eng	Is it money you need?
3730318	eng	How do you think Tom died?
3730319	eng	Is that why they died?
3730320	eng	Would you happen to be married?
3730321	eng	Were you there when Tom talked?
3730322	eng	Why haven't you eaten the food I cooked?
3730323	eng	What have I misspelled?
3730324	eng	Do you want to get us both killed?
3730325	eng	Why do you think Tom was killed?
3730326	eng	How many men have you killed?
3730327	eng	How many have you killed?
3730328	eng	How could it have happened?
3730329	eng	Whereabouts did you say this happened?
3730330	eng	Can you determine what happened?
3730331	eng	What's your theory on what happened?
3730332	eng	Why wouldn't you let me tell you what happened?
3730333	eng	Do you want to tell the jury what happened?
3730334	eng	Where was Tom imprisoned?
3730335	eng	Are you suggesting Tom was murdered?
3730336	eng	Where were you when the fire occurred?
3730337	eng	How are you connected?

3732226	eng	I didn't like my first job.
3732227	eng	I've decided to start looking for a new job.
3732228	eng	This is a private club.
3732229	eng	We'll see you at the pub.
3732230	eng	We're stuck in traffic.
3732231	eng	This could start a panic.
3732232	eng	I couldn't think of a better place to have a picnic.
3732233	eng	I think you're going to have a lot of fun at the picnic.
3732234	eng	There weren't many boys at the picnic.
3732235	eng	I think you'll enjoy the picnic.
3732236	eng	Tom was a fanatic.
3732237	eng	It was incredibly romantic.
3732238	eng	Tom seemed to be frantic.
3732239	eng	Tom felt fantastic.
3732240	eng	Let's go see what's in your attic.
3732241	eng	I feel quite bad.
3732242	eng	Tom might do something bad.
3732243	eng	Tom didn't do anything bad.
3732244	eng	I still feel bad.
3732245	eng	Tom wasn't so bad.
3732246	eng	It wasn't so bad.
3732247	eng	It wasn't all that bad.
3732248	eng	If Tom wanted to kill me, I'd already be dead.
3732249	eng	The batteries are dead.
3732250	eng	These batteries are dead.
3732251	eng	Tom may be injured or dead.
3732252	eng	Almost everyone was dead.
3732253	eng	The microphone is dead.
3732254	eng	They're probably already dead.
3732255	eng	I can't seem to get Tom out of my head.
3732256	eng	Someone must lead.
3732257	eng	I didn't know you couldn't read.
3732258	eng	Tom reminded Mary that she needed to buy some bread.
3732259	eng	No meal is complete without bread.
3732260	eng	Ask Tom instead.
3732261	eng	My mother often makes pasta salad.
3732262	eng	Everybody will be very glad.
3732263	eng	I'm going mad.
3732264	eng	Tom stumbled down the road.
3732265	eng	Tom told me that he was planning to study abroad.
3732266	eng	I was surprised when Tom said he was going to study abroad.
3732267	eng	Tom told me he was sad.
3732268	eng	There's not much more to add.
3732269	eng	Tom might not have the strength to get out of bed.
3732270	eng	I thought you were in bed.
3732271	eng	Tom was lying in bed.
3732272	eng	Tom went back to bed.
3732273	eng	They all went to bed.
3732274	eng	I'm ready for bed.
3732275	eng	I didn't want to be disturbed.
3732276	eng	I'm unconvinced.
3732277	eng	I think it's better if we get divorced.
3732278	eng	Tom never told me why he got divorced.
3732279	eng	It's clear that Tom isn't yet persuaded.
3732280	eng	That was just what I needed.
3732281	eng	This is exactly what I needed.
3732282	eng	More time will be needed.
3732283	eng	Tom seemed to have everything he needed.
3732284	eng	I couldn't afford to buy everything we needed.
3732285	eng	I can do it blindfolded.
3732286	eng	We're short-handed.
3732287	eng	We just landed.
3732288	eng	The ceremony has ended.
3732289	eng	I hope you're not offended.
3732290	eng	Tom's prison sentence was suspended.
3732291	eng	Some of them were wounded.
3732292	eng	I wonder if Tom knows where I can buy what I need.
3732293	eng	Tom might be able to loan us the money we need.
3732294	eng	Take as much as you need.
3732295	eng	The dog needs to be fed.
3732296	eng	We could've managed.
3732297	eng	They've all been paged.
3732298	eng	Tom is beginning to get discouraged.
3732299	eng	Plans are meant to be changed.
3732300	eng	It can't be changed.
3732301	eng	Nothing was changed.
3732302	eng	Everything was arranged.
3732303	eng	We were all very touched.
3732304	eng	Some of the girls laughed.
3732305	eng	My computer has crashed.
3732306	tur	Bir gelişme olduğunda sana haber veririm.
3732307	eng	I think you've been brainwashed.
3732308	eng	It's not quite finished.
3732309	eng	The report is not quite finished.
3732310	eng	Tom ought to be punished.
3732311	eng	Tom wasn't punished.
3732312	eng	Tom never knew his grandfather was rich until after he died.
3732313	eng	According to police, no one died.
3732314	eng	I haven't been to Boston since Tom died.
3732315	eng	My battery died.
3732316	eng	Tom was satisfied.
3732317	eng	Tom wasn't satisfied.
3732318	eng	I know you're still not satisfied.
3732319	eng	In school, Tom was often bullied.
3732320	eng	Your request is denied.
3732321	eng	Tom seemed preoccupied.
3732322	eng	Tom seemed to think that you and I used to be married.
3732323	eng	Tom told me he used to be married.
3732324	eng	I think you should tell your parents that we're married.
3732325	eng	I heard you were getting married.
3732326	eng	I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
3732327	eng	Tom should've told Mary that he was married.
3732328	eng	Tom asked if Mary was married.
3732329	eng	Tom wasn't aware that Mary was married.
3732330	eng	Tom knew Mary was married.
3732331	eng	Perhaps Tom is married.
3732332	eng	Tom and Mary weren't married.
3732333	eng	I don't think you should get married.
3732334	eng	I didn't know you were planning to get married.
3732335	eng	I plan to never get married.
3732336	eng	I'm already married.
3732337	eng	I can tell that you're worried.
3732338	eng	Everybody else looks worried.
3732339	eng	Tom wasn't worried.
3732340	eng	Your door was unlocked.
3732341	eng	I still think we should've bought the painting you liked.
3732342	eng	Tom wanted to know where Mary worked.
3732343	eng	Don't forget to do what I asked.
3732344	eng	I'll see to it that Tom does everything you've asked.
3732345	eng	I've done what you've asked.
3732346	eng	I should've done what Tom asked.
3732347	eng	Tom might not do what you asked.
3732348	eng	Everyone giggled.
3732349	eng	Tom read the message and smiled.
3732350	eng	Tom was spoiled.
3732351	eng	Tom got killed.
3732352	eng	Tom can't be so easily fooled.
3732353	eng	I was startled.
3732354	eng	It's all settled.
3732355	eng	Tom was puzzled.
3732356	eng	That was why Tom screamed.
3732357	eng	One of the youngsters screamed.
3732358	eng	Perhaps Tom was feeling ashamed.
3732359	eng	I think you've been misinformed.
3732360	eng	Let's see if we can get the gate opened.
3732361	eng	I can't get this lock opened.
3732362	eng	I can't get this door opened.
3732363	eng	Tom wasn't able to explain what had happened.
3732364	eng	Tom told me all about what had happened.
3732365	eng	Tom pretended that he didn't know about what had happened.
3732366	eng	This conversation never happened.
3732367	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't yet know about what's happened.
3732368	eng	That's not all that happened.
3732369	eng	I had nothing to do with what happened.
3732370	eng	I need to find out what happened.
3732371	eng	I wonder if we'll ever find out what happened.
3732372	eng	Tell me about what happened.
3732373	eng	Tom never said anything about what happened.
3732374	eng	Tom never said much about what happened.
3732375	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom about what happened.
3732376	eng	Perhaps we should tell Tom about what happened.
3732377	eng	Tom wants to talk to you about what happened.
3732378	eng	I thought you'd like to know what happened.
3732379	eng	Tom and Mary think I don't know what happened.
3732380	eng	Tom wasn't foolish enough to tell Mary what had really happened.
3732381	eng	We should give Tom a chance to tell us what really happened.
3732382	eng	I just want to know what actually happened.
3732383	eng	Tom seemed to be frightened.
3732384	eng	Tom sounds frightened.
3732385	eng	Tom never complained.
3732386	eng	Tom ought to have his head examined.
3732387	eng	Even Tom grinned.
3732388	eng	Tom felt lonely and abandoned.
3732389	eng	It's poisoned.
3732390	eng	I got a little sunburned.
3732391	eng	Everybody jumped.
3732392	eng	My clock has stopped.
3732393	eng	The leaves have turned red.
3732394	eng	Tom got a little red.
3732395	eng	Tom knew that Mary cared.
3732396	eng	Tom wasn't a bit scared.
3732397	eng	Tom isn't a bit scared.
3732398	eng	Tom seemed prepared.
3732399	eng	I thought you'd be better prepared.
3732400	eng	Tom might've been murdered.
3732401	eng	Tom never fully recovered.
3732402	eng	There are still so many questions that need to be answered.
3732403	eng	There's still one more question that you haven't yet answered.
3732404	eng	Tom knocked on the door, but nobody answered.
3732405	eng	It's being repaired.
3732406	eng	Tom quickly reloaded his gun and fired.
3732407	eng	I thought Tom would get fired.
3732408	eng	Everyone except Tom looked tired.
3732409	eng	Tom seemed tired.
3732410	eng	Tom looked hot and tired.
3732411	eng	I thought you'd be tired.
3732412	eng	Tom might be tired.
3732413	eng	I feel a little tired.
3732414	eng	They said they're tired.
3732415	eng	Tom didn't feel tired.
3732416	eng	Everybody was tired.
3732417	eng	I'm beginning to get tired.
3732418	eng	I'm feeling a bit tired.
3732419	eng	Tom wasn't a bit tired.
3732420	eng	I really am very tired.
3732421	eng	Tom doesn't seem very tired.
3732422	eng	Tom kept working even though he was very tired.
3732423	eng	Tom felt very tired.
3732424	eng	Tom was pretty tired.
3732425	eng	I've retired.
3732426	eng	Tom retired.
3732427	eng	According to the police, no one was injured.
3732428	eng	Tom looked very pleased.
3732429	eng	In school, Tom was often teased.
3732430	eng	Tom was a little surprised.
3732431	eng	Tom was surprised.
3732432	eng	I bet Tom was surprised.
3732433	eng	Those doors should be closed.
3732434	eng	The gates were closed.
3732435	eng	Let's see if we can get the gate closed.
3732436	eng	The shop was closed.
3732437	eng	The door is now closed.
3732438	eng	The deadline has passed.
3732439	eng	Tom seemed embarrassed.
3732440	eng	Everybody was very well dressed.
3732441	eng	I'm not dressed.
3732442	eng	Tom went home depressed.
3732443	eng	Tom wondered why Mary seemed so depressed.
3732444	eng	The kids are impressed.
3732445	eng	The kids weren't impressed.
3732446	eng	I think Tom is feeling a little stressed.
3732447	eng	You were the first girl I ever kissed.
3732449	eng	I'm getting confused.
3732450	eng	The kids look confused.
3732451	eng	I'm getting a bit confused.
3732452	eng	Everyone's a bit confused.
3732453	eng	I was totally confused.
3732454	eng	Tom was utterly confused.
3732455	eng	My curiosity was aroused.
3732456	eng	It's a little complicated.
3732457	eng	The first proposal was too complicated.
3732458	eng	Well, it's complicated.
3732459	eng	Everyone's life is complicated.
3732460	eng	The situation is very complicated.
3732461	eng	I felt lied to and cheated.
3732462	eng	I think you've been cheated.
3732463	eng	Tom never hesitated.
3732464	eng	I think you've been infected.
3732465	eng	That cut looks infected.
3732466	eng	Tom was taller than I expected.
3732467	eng	Tom's cooking was more delicious than I expected.
3732468	eng	It's just what I expected.
3732469	eng	It was more difficult than I'd expected.
3732470	eng	That was to be expected.
3732471	eng	Tom must be protected.
3732472	eng	The environment must be protected.
3732473	eng	Tom sat down and waited.
3732474	eng	Tom knocked on the door and waited.
3732475	eng	This isn't quite what I wanted.
3732476	eng	This isn't what I wanted.
3732477	eng	This is definitely not what I wanted.
3732478	eng	That was just what I wanted.
3732479	eng	That's exactly what I wanted.
3732481	eng	Tom wants to be wanted.
3732482	eng	Tom had everything he wanted.
3732483	eng	Tom never told me what he wanted.
3732484	eng	Tom seemed to know what he wanted.
3732485	eng	I know this isn't what you wanted.
3732486	eng	Tom knew what Mary wanted.
3732487	eng	Tom seems a little disoriented.
3732488	eng	I must've fainted.
3732489	eng	Tom wasn't at all satisfied with the way his house had been painted.
3732490	eng	Tom seemed disappointed.
3732491	eng	Both Tom and Mary were disappointed.
3732492	eng	Tom might've been disappointed.
3732493	eng	Tom seemed somewhat disappointed.
3732494	eng	Tom was obviously very disappointed.
3732495	eng	The votes are being counted.
3732496	eng	I don't like to be interrupted.
3732497	eng	I don't even remember how it started.
3732498	eng	The room was deserted.
3732499	eng	The street is deserted.
3732500	eng	Your time won't be wasted.
3732501	eng	I finally feel rested.
3732502	eng	Tom looked interested.
3732503	eng	Tom seemed interested.
3732504	eng	Tom acted interested.
3732505	eng	They were interested.
3732506	eng	Tom was interested.
3732507	eng	I told you I wasn't interested.
3732508	eng	Tom wasn't the first person the police arrested.
3732509	eng	It's not Tom's fault you were arrested.
3732510	eng	I've done what you've requested.
3732511	eng	They said they're exhausted.
3732512	eng	Tom kept working even though he was exhausted.
3732513	eng	Tom seemed relieved.
3732514	eng	Tom wasn't deceived.
3732515	eng	Tom wanted to know where I lived.
3732516	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary where he lived.
3732517	eng	I didn't tell Tom where you lived.
3732518	eng	Tom asked where Mary lived.
3732519	eng	Tom wanted to know where Mary lived.
3732520	eng	I wouldn't get involved.
3732521	eng	We were all very moved.
3732522	eng	This web page can't be displayed.
3732523	eng	Tom seemed annoyed.
3732524	eng	Tom seemed dazed.
3732525	eng	I think I need a hearing aid.
3732526	eng	Tom is wearing a hearing aid.
3732527	eng	We'll be well paid.
3732528	eng	They'll be well paid.
3732529	eng	I'm not sure how much you'll get paid.
3732530	eng	I'm not at all afraid.
3732531	eng	I was a bit afraid.
3732532	eng	Don't forget what I said.
3732533	eng	Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary had said.
3732534	eng	Something had to be said.
3732535	eng	Tom didn't quite understand what was being said.
3732536	eng	That was all Tom said.
3732537	eng	I really liked what Tom said.
3732538	tur	Bir gelişme olduğunda bana haber verir misin?
3732539	tur	Bir gelişme olduğunda bana haber verebilir misiniz?
3732540	ben	আমার টমের সঙ্গে কথা বলার কোনো প্রয়োজন নেই।
3732541	tur	Geri döneceğim, söz veriyorum.
3732542	ben	আমার মনে হয় না টম আপনাকে ঘৃণা করে।
3732543	eng	I should've listened to what Tom said.
3732544	eng	Tom seemed to understand everything you said.
3732545	eng	Tom believed what Mary said.
3732546	eng	Tom wasn't upset by what Mary said.
3732547	eng	Tom did better than I did.
3732548	eng	I thought you'd reach the same conclusion as I did.
3732549	eng	Tom wouldn't even give me a chance to explain why I did what I did.
3732550	eng	I've always liked you more than you thought I did.
3732551	eng	I know Tom didn't do what you said he did.
3732552	eng	I wonder if Tom really did what Mary said he did.
3732553	eng	Tom wants to make sure we don't make the same mistake he did.
3732554	eng	Tom seems to have reasons for everything he did.
3732555	eng	I've never forgiven Tom for what he did.
3732556	eng	Tom never forgave Mary for what she did.
3732557	eng	I'm not sure that Tom enjoyed the party as much as we did.
3732558	eng	I would've done the same thing Tom did.
3732559	eng	I wish I could've done what Tom did.
3732560	eng	Tom ought to tell Mary all about what he and John did.
3732561	eng	It didn't happen the way you said it did.
3732562	eng	Tom used the same excuse as you just did.
3732563	eng	I didn't tell anyone what you did.
3732564	eng	You had your reasons for doing what you did.
3732565	eng	I've already told Tom what you did.
3732566	eng	I would've done exactly what you did.
3732567	eng	Tom got here earlier than Mary did.
3732568	eng	Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary did.
3732569	eng	Tom wasn't upset by what Mary did.
3732570	eng	I'm sick and tired of being called a kid.
3732571	eng	Tom is no longer a kid.
3732572	eng	My father used to bring me here when I was a kid.
3732573	eng	My father used to read me bedtime stories when I was a kid.
3732574	eng	Tom took me to the circus when I was a kid.
3732575	eng	Tom has been living here since he was a kid.
3732576	eng	I've made some mistakes that I should've been able to avoid.
3732577	eng	I think you're stupid.
3732578	eng	They're stupid.
3732579	eng	Tom thinks your ideas are stupid.
3732580	eng	Tom is incredibly stupid.
3732581	eng	Tom is an expert in this field.
3732582	eng	The audience went wild.
3732583	eng	Tom was old.
3732584	eng	Tom looked very old.
3732585	eng	I may have caught cold.
3732586	eng	It isn't a bit cold.
3732587	eng	It felt very cold.
3732588	eng	Tom says he wants to travel around the world.
3732589	eng	There are plenty of idiots in the world.
3732590	eng	I helped Tom the best I could.
3732591	eng	Tom wanted to get his driver's license as soon as he could.
3732592	eng	It didn't happen the way you said it would.
3732593	eng	I think you might need to give Tom a hand.
3732594	eng	Tom touched the hot stove and burned his hand.
3732595	eng	Tom knows this area like the back of his hand.
3732596	eng	Honshu is Japan's largest island.
3732597	eng	Tom didn't stand.
3732598	eng	Tom didn't quite understand.
3732599	eng	Tom pretended not to understand.
3732600	eng	I think Tom didn't understand.
3732601	eng	Tom is more of an acquaintance than a friend.
3732602	eng	Tom was Mary's friend.
3732603	eng	I thought you were Tom's best friend.
3732604	eng	This is my best friend.
3732605	eng	I already have a girlfriend.
3732606	eng	I don't even know if Tom has a girlfriend.
3732607	eng	I like you better than my last girlfriend.

3732609	eng	Let's go camping this coming weekend.
3732610	eng	Tom might've gone to Boston this weekend.

3732614	eng	Let's go hiking next weekend.
3732615	eng	Tom'll be in Boston next weekend.
3732616	eng	I'm not going to go to Boston next weekend.
3732617	eng	I wonder what Tom is going to do next weekend.
3732618	eng	Tom wants to know if you're planning on going to Boston with us next weekend.
3732619	eng	I know this isn't exactly what you wanted, but it's all I could find.
3732620	eng	Tom was very kind.
3732621	eng	This isn't quite what I had in mind.
3732622	eng	This is definitely not what I had in mind.
3732623	eng	I have something else in mind.
3732624	eng	Tom is old enough to make up his own mind.
3732625	eng	Tom has changed his mind.
3732626	eng	I didn't mind.
3732627	eng	You're not in your right mind.
3732628	eng	I've just changed my mind.
3732629	eng	Let me show you something I found.
3732630	eng	I don't like standing around.
3732631	eng	I think I'll have a look around.
3732632	eng	Tom stopped to look around.
3732633	eng	I can see why Tom likes having you around.
3732634	eng	I hate that sound.
3732635	eng	Maybe you're not as stupid as you sound.
3732636	eng	I think we'll need more food.
3732637	eng	I should've bought more food.
3732638	eng	I think I should've bought more food.
3732639	eng	I think we'd better buy more food.
3732640	eng	Thank you for buying food.
3732641	eng	I thought Tom might not like Thai food.
3732642	eng	I like junk food.
3732643	eng	I think you've been eating too much junk food.
3732644	eng	I have a feeling you'll like Mexican food.
3732645	eng	Tom might not like Mexican food.
3732646	eng	Tom thought that Mary would like Indonesian food.
3732647	eng	Tom thought that Mary wouldn't like Malaysian food.
3732648	eng	Tom is the only one here who doesn't like spicy food.
3732649	eng	What I saw looked good.
3732650	eng	Most, if not all, parents want their children to be good.
3732651	eng	This had better be good.
3732652	eng	This better be good.
3732653	eng	Hunger makes anything taste good.
3732654	eng	They're no good.
3732655	eng	Tom is up to no good.
3732656	eng	Tom's French is already rather good.
3732657	eng	Everything was good.
3732658	eng	Tom wasn't good.
3732659	eng	This cake isn't that good.
3732660	eng	They didn't think any of my suggestions were any good.
3732661	eng	They say it's very good.
3732662	eng	Tom's French is very good.
3732663	eng	No one else understood.
3732664	eng	I think you've misunderstood.
3732665	eng	I think you misunderstood.
3732666	eng	Let me give you my business card.
3732667	eng	The last time I saw Tom, he had a beard.
3732668	eng	I had to shout in order to be heard.
3732669	eng	That was all we heard.
3732670	eng	This shouldn't be hard.
3732671	eng	This shouldn't be too hard.
3732672	eng	I think you've been working too hard.
3732673	eng	This really isn't hard.
3732674	eng	I know you've been studying very hard.
3732675	eng	I want to learn how to snowboard.
3732676	eng	I don't think Tom needs a bodyguard.
3732677	eng	I thought Tom would get accepted to Harvard.
3732678	eng	Tom never told me he wanted to go to Harvard.
3732679	eng	Tom never really wanted to go to Harvard.
3732680	eng	I've decided to apply to Harvard.
3732681	eng	I thought you'd be interested to know that Tom got accepted into Harvard.
3732682	eng	Tom never for one moment imagined that he'd be able to get into Harvard.
3732683	eng	I met Tom when I was a sophomore at Harvard.
3732684	eng	This is really awkward.
3732685	eng	Come back here, you coward.
3732686	eng	Everyone's out in the back yard.
3732687	eng	This is a little weird.
3732689	eng	Everyone thinks I'm weird.
3732690	eng	Tom couldn't remember his password.
3732691	eng	That's just absurd.
3732692	eng	It doesn't matter if there's a crowd.
3732693	eng	Tom wasn't as busy as Mary told me he would be.
3732694	eng	It wasn't where Tom said it would be.
3732695	eng	It was right where Tom said it would be.
3732696	eng	Tom wouldn't be here if he didn't have to be.
3732697	eng	The movie was a lot better than I expected it to be.
3732698	eng	Look at Tom's face.
3732699	eng	Tom stole the necklace.
3732700	eng	This is a public place.
3732701	eng	Tom wasn't able to be here to meet you himself, so he asked me to come in his place.
3732702	eng	Tom told me about this place.
3732703	eng	My father told me about this place.
3732704	eng	Tom stared into space.
3732705	eng	It was a disgrace.
3732706	eng	I'm glad Tom made it home in one piece.
3732707	eng	There's someone waiting for you in your office.
3732708	eng	Tom went into Mary's office.
3732709	eng	Tom might be in his office.
3732710	eng	Tom ushered Mary into his office.
3732711	eng	I didn't say this was my office.
3732712	eng	I called the police.
3732713	eng	Tom ought to have called the police.
3732714	eng	We know what you told the police.
3732715	eng	Tom wasn't scared of the police.
3732716	eng	Tom was caught by the police.
3732717	eng	Stop trying to be nice.
3732718	eng	I guess Tom was just trying to be nice.
3732719	eng	You do look nice.
3732720	eng	Tom wasn't nice.
3732721	eng	Everyone's been really nice.
3732722	eng	This place is really nice.
3732723	eng	Tom is really awfully nice.
3732724	eng	I think you've made the wrong choice.
3732725	eng	I didn't want to come, but I had no choice.
3732726	eng	There was no other choice.
3732727	eng	Hunger is the best spice.
3732728	eng	People might notice.
3732729	eng	That's justice.
3732730	eng	I think you've been getting bad advice.
3732731	eng	I think you've been listening to some very bad advice.
3732732	eng	I really appreciate your advice.
3732733	eng	My advice would be to ignore Tom's advice.
3732734	eng	I've only seen Tom twice.
3732735	eng	I'm not going to say this twice.
3732736	eng	I was surprised when Tom asked me to the dance.
3732737	eng	I don't want to go to the dance.
3732738	eng	I thought Tom might ask Mary to the dance.
3732739	eng	Thank you for your guidance.
3732740	eng	I thought I'd take a chance.
3732741	eng	At least give me a chance.
3732742	eng	I should've kissed you when I had the chance.
3732743	eng	Now is your chance.
3732744	eng	Here's my chance.
3732746	eng	Tom is a real nuisance.
3732747	eng	Tom has no inheritance.
3732748	eng	I should've paid in advance.
3732749	eng	That's quite a coincidence.
3732750	eng	It was too great a coincidence.
3732751	eng	It was nothing but a coincidence.
3732752	eng	It could be coincidence.
3732753	eng	I climbed the fence.
3732754	eng	I crawled under the fence.
3732755	eng	I climbed over the fence.
3732756	eng	The kids climbed over the fence.
3732757	eng	I have a clear conscience.
3732758	eng	Please don't lose patience.
3732759	eng	There was total silence.
3732760	eng	There was silence.
3732761	eng	That made all the difference.
3732762	eng	Tom won't know the difference.
3732763	eng	It doesn't make much difference.
3732764	eng	Tom was hard to convince.
3732765	eng	I've only seen Tom once.
3732766	eng	Tom might have been a teacher once.
3732767	eng	I was young and ambitious once.
3732768	eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was asking him for a divorce.
3732769	eng	We suspect that someone murdered Tom and just made it look like suicide.
3732770	eng	Tom never thought that Mary would commit suicide.
3732771	eng	There was nowhere we could hide.
3732772	eng	I didn't know where to hide.
3732773	eng	There was nowhere to hide.
3732774	eng	Everyone has something to hide.
3732775	eng	The police detective said that all of the doors and windows were locked from the inside.
3732776	eng	Please go back inside.
3732777	eng	I think we'd better stay inside.
3732778	eng	The place was empty inside.
3732779	eng	We waited outside.
3732780	eng	There's someone waiting for me outside.
3732781	eng	Let's see what's happening outside.
3732782	eng	I want to eat breakfast outside.
3732783	eng	We'll meet you outside.
3732784	eng	I shouldn't have been so rude.
3732785	eng	I think you've got a really bad attitude.
3732786	eng	Bring me a cup of coffee.
3732787	eng	I like a good cup of coffee.
3732788	eng	Tom helped himself to coffee.
3732789	eng	The drink I drink the most is coffee.
3732790	eng	Tom doesn't like milk in his coffee.
3732791	eng	I scraped my knee.
3732792	eng	I hurt my knee.
3732793	eng	I've got to be free.
3732794	eng	Tom never would agree.
3732795	eng	Tom might not agree.
3732796	eng	I hope you agree.
3732797	eng	I have to disagree.
3732798	eng	I don't know how many years ago it was, but it was certainly more than three.
3732799	eng	My car is older than this tree.
3732800	eng	Try it and see.
3732801	eng	I couldn't see.
3732802	eng	Now you're safe.
3732803	eng	I still think we're safe.
3732804	eng	Let me put that somewhere safe.
3732805	eng	I'll put it somewhere safe.
3732806	eng	Tom never allowed Mary to see what was in his safe.
3732807	eng	I wonder if Tom knows the combination to this safe.
3732808	eng	You're perfectly safe.
3732809	eng	Anxiety is the worst demon in life.
3732810	eng	Mary is the love of my life.
3732811	eng	I got out my knife.
3732812	eng	Tom usually carries a pocketknife.
3732813	eng	Tom doesn't have a wife.
3732814	eng	I'll discuss it with my wife.
3732815	eng	I'll tell my wife.
3732816	eng	Tom might be more comfortable discussing this with someone his own age.
3732817	eng	Tom reminds me of myself when I was his age.
3732818	eng	Tom wanted Mary to take out the garbage.
3732819	eng	Let's find a place to put your luggage.
3732820	eng	Tom turned to the next page.
3732821	eng	I need to finish cleaning out the garage.
3732822	eng	It shouldn't take us long to clean out the garage.
3732823	eng	Tom will be helping us paint our garage.
3732824	eng	I was impressed by Tom's courage.
3732825	eng	Tom never gave Mary your message.
3732826	eng	That's common knowledge.
3732827	eng	I didn't budge.
3732828	eng	Tom is now enrolled in college.
3732829	eng	Tom might possibly have studied French when he was in college.
3732830	eng	Tom counted the change.
3732831	eng	Tom counted his change.
3732832	eng	Weather conditions may change.
3732833	eng	You guys are strange.
3732834	eng	It was rather strange.
3732835	eng	It was strange.
3732836	eng	This is really strange.
3732837	eng	It was awfully strange.
3732838	eng	It was very strange.
3732839	eng	It was a challenge.
3732840	eng	They left me in charge.
3732841	eng	Tom's in charge.
3732842	eng	The bank robbers are still at large.
3732843	eng	Tom taught all his classes today, even though he had a terrible headache.
3732844	eng	I thought you were going to die.
3732846	eng	I'm going to build a doghouse for Cookie.
3732847	eng	That wasn't a lie.
3732848	eng	I thought I'd wear a tie.
3732849	eng	Take off your tie.
3732850	eng	Help me with my tie.
3732851	eng	Tom is watching a movie.
3732852	eng	They're making a movie.
3732853	eng	I think this is the best part of the movie.
3732854	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy the movie.
3732855	eng	Tom thought that Mary would like this movie.
3732856	eng	Tom wouldn't like this movie.
3732857	eng	I think you'll enjoy this movie.
3732858	eng	I knew you'd enjoy that movie.
3732859	eng	I thought Tom might enjoy that movie.
3732860	eng	Tom opened the oven and took out the cake.
3732861	eng	Cheesecake is my favorite cake.
3732862	eng	Tom thought I ate his piece of cake.
3732863	eng	Tom got the last piece of cake.
3732864	eng	Have some birthday cake.
3732865	eng	These are hard to make.
3732866	eng	I don't care which choice you make.
3732867	eng	I wonder which road I should take.
3732868	eng	There must be a mistake.
3732869	eng	Perhaps I made a mistake.
3732870	eng	I admit I made a mistake.
3732871	eng	I don't deny I made a mistake.
3732872	eng	I must've made a mistake.
3732873	eng	Tom must've made a mistake.
3732874	eng	You must've made a mistake.
3732875	eng	I think maybe you've made a mistake.
3732876	eng	It's an understandable mistake.
3732877	eng	I think you've just made a big mistake.
3732878	eng	That's a very common mistake.
3732879	eng	Tom apologized for his mistake.
3732880	eng	When you called, I was already awake.
3732881	eng	Maybe I'll buy a bike.
3732882	eng	That's what I like.
3732883	eng	Pick anything you like.
3732884	eng	Take what you like.
3732885	eng	I thought that you didn't smoke.
3732886	eng	My car isn't for sale.
3732887	eng	It's highly improbable.
3732888	eng	Tom ought to be reliable.
3732889	eng	Tom's voice is unmistakable.
3732890	eng	The kitchen chairs aren't stackable.
3732891	eng	This price is reasonable.
3732892	eng	Tom looks a little miserable.
3732893	eng	I'm very miserable.
3732894	eng	Your kids are adorable.
3732895	eng	I put the book on the table.
3732896	eng	Tom put his hat on the table.
3732897	eng	Tom left his wallet on the table.
3732898	eng	Tom took off his watch and put it on the table.
3732899	eng	Please come to the table.
3732900	eng	Tom went back to the table.
3732901	eng	Tom was sitting at the table.
3732902	eng	It's quite comfortable.
3732903	eng	Tom looked uncomfortable.
3732904	eng	You're making Tom uncomfortable.
3732905	eng	I was uncomfortable.
3732906	eng	This is the best horse in the stable.
3732907	eng	It seemed unbelievable.
3732908	eng	It really is unbelievable.
3732909	eng	It was really incredible.
3732910	eng	It was pretty incredible.
3732911	eng	Anything seemed possible.
3732912	eng	It would've been possible.
3732913	eng	Tom wants you to get here as soon as possible.
3732914	eng	Tom wants you to call him as soon as possible.
3732915	eng	I want a full report as soon as possible.
3732916	eng	Run as fast as possible.
3732917	eng	Come as early as possible.
3732918	eng	That might be impossible.
3732919	eng	It's always been impossible.
3732920	eng	That would be physically impossible.
3732921	eng	It was irresistible.
3732922	eng	This smells like trouble.
3732923	eng	That smells like trouble.
3732924	eng	I've already caused Tom a lot of trouble.
3732925	eng	We're in a lot of trouble.
3732926	eng	Now we're in trouble.
3732927	eng	Don't get into trouble.
3732928	eng	You're in for trouble.
3732929	eng	I'll do my best not to cause any trouble.
3732930	eng	I gave Tom my old bicycle.
3732931	eng	Tom told me that he would like to buy a new bicycle.
3732932	eng	Tom won't let me buy a motorcycle.
3732933	eng	I wonder what Tom is going to do with his old motorcycle.
3732934	eng	Tom was the one who taught me how to play the ukulele.
3732935	eng	This might take a while.
3732936	eng	This may take a while.
3732937	eng	This may take me a while.
3732938	eng	I haven't been to a concert in a while.
3732939	eng	This won't be a safe place for a while.
3732940	eng	Tom won't be teaching for a while.
3732941	eng	I've been traveling for a while.
3732942	tur	Bay Tom, acil servisten bekleniyorsunuz.
3732943	ben	আমার মনে হয় না টম আপনাকে পছন্দ করে।
3732944	eng	Tom lived in Boston for a while.
3732945	eng	Tom and Mary lived in Boston for a while.
3732946	eng	I've been in Boston for a while.
3732947	eng	Tom ought to stay in Boston for a while.
3732948	eng	I thought you'd want Tom to stay with you for a while.
3732949	eng	It doesn't cost money to smile.
3732950	eng	Tom didn't smile.
3732951	eng	Tom knows how to make Mary smile.
3732952	eng	Tom said you sprained an ankle.
3732953	eng	Tom reached down and scratched his ankle.
3732954	eng	Just say something short and simple.
3732955	eng	It's basically quite simple.
3732956	eng	That would've been simple.
3732957	eng	Life isn't always simple.
3732958	eng	This really isn't that simple.
3732959	eng	It's amazingly simple.
3732960	eng	I think you've been listening to the wrong people.
3732961	eng	Tom knows many famous people.
3732962	eng	I got out my knife and peeled the apple.
3732963	eng	I gave Tom an apple.
3732964	eng	I suggest that you take a break and cool off a little.
3732965	eng	Tom has changed very little.
3732966	eng	There's not much juice left in the bottle.
3732967	eng	Tom looked at the schedule.
3732968	eng	This is an old rule.
3732969	eng	That's the rule.
3732970	eng	Tom was the only one who was able to solve the puzzle.
3732971	eng	I'm glad you reminded me.
3732972	eng	My friends encouraged me.
3732973	eng	They bullied me.
3732974	eng	Tom and Mary have helped me.
3732975	eng	Tom's behavior infuriated me.
3732976	eng	It interested me.
3732977	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me he loved me.
3732978	eng	Tom decided on his own to come see me.
3732979	eng	Tom didn't seem pleased to see me.
3732980	eng	I didn't want anyone to see me.
3732981	eng	I should've known you wouldn't want to see me.
3732982	eng	People tend to like me.
3732983	eng	Tom was like me.
3732984	eng	I've always thought you didn't like me.
3732985	eng	I get the feeling that you don't like me.
3732986	eng	I don't understand why you don't like me.
3732987	eng	I want to know why you don't like me.
3732988	eng	I can't understand why Tom doesn't like me.
3732989	eng	Tom is a lot like me.
3732990	eng	You're not like me.
3732991	eng	That doesn't trouble me.
3732992	eng	I want to show you what Tom gave me.
3732993	eng	I really liked the gift you gave me.
3732994	eng	Tom would never forgive me.
3732995	eng	Tom never did love me.
3732996	eng	I wish Tom were here right now instead of me.
3732997	eng	They're not afraid of me.
3732998	eng	That was very careless of me.
3732999	eng	Thanks for rescuing me.
3733000	eng	Tom danced with me.
3733001	eng	Tom will come with me.
3733002	eng	My wife didn't come with me.
3733003	eng	You'll be here with me.
3733004	eng	There's something wrong with me.
3733005	eng	Tom was with me.
3733006	eng	I think you've been honest with me.
3733007	eng	Tom did stay with me.
3733008	eng	I think I should've brought more money with me.
3733009	eng	Come on, tell me.
3733010	eng	You don't have to hide anything from me.
3733011	eng	You've been stealing from me.
3733012	eng	Tom is only a couple of years older than me.
3733013	eng	Tom is only a few years older than me.
3733014	eng	You've been luckier than me.
3733015	eng	Tom is a little taller than me.
3733016	eng	The joke's on me.
3733017	eng	Tom doesn't count on me.
3733018	eng	You can always rely on me.
3733019	eng	That doesn't concern me.
3733020	eng	It tasted good to me.
3733021	eng	That seems weird to me.
3733022	eng	Tom was very nice to me.
3733023	eng	That sounds strange to me.
3733024	eng	Tom never wrote to me.
3733025	eng	I think you've been lying to me.
3733026	eng	They didn't speak to me.
3733027	eng	I'm not sure Tom's going to be willing to talk to me.
3733028	eng	You are someone very special to me.
3733029	eng	I'll never forget how kind you've been to me.
3733030	eng	I need somebody to listen to me.
3733031	eng	Tom has written to me.
3733032	eng	It doesn't look like fun to me.
3733033	eng	I can't believe Tom would do that to me.
3733034	eng	Tom explained it to me.
3733035	eng	I thought I'd understand it once you explained it to me.
3733036	eng	Tom never mentioned it to me.
3733037	eng	That would mean a lot to me.
3733038	eng	This means a lot to me.
3733039	eng	This is quite new to me.
3733040	eng	This is new to me.
3733041	eng	I wasn't able to catch the ball that Tom threw to me.
3733042	eng	That sounds funny to me.
3733043	eng	This is all a mystery to me.
3733044	eng	Maybe if I find Tom, he can help me.
3733045	eng	If you want me to help you, you've got to help me.
3733046	eng	Tom seemed to remember me.
3733047	eng	I really liked what you cooked for me.
3733048	eng	That's the place for me.
3733049	eng	If you see Tom, say hello to him for me.
3733050	eng	I need Tom to do a couple of things for me.
3733051	eng	Tom works for me.
3733052	eng	I thought you were going to wait for me.
3733053	eng	This place is too noisy for me.
3733054	eng	Tom will never pay me what he owes me.
3733055	eng	Tom hasn't yet paid back the money he owes me.
3733056	eng	Tom might be a little mad at me.
3733057	eng	I know you're still mad at me.
3733058	eng	I don't like it when Tom is mad at me.
3733059	eng	Everyone's looking at me.
3733060	eng	They're shooting at me.
3733061	eng	Tom threw a piece of chalk at me.
3733062	eng	Perhaps you can beat me.
3733063	eng	I don't want Tom to forget me.
3733064	eng	Don't forget me.
3733065	eng	I'm trying to help Tom, but he won't let me.
3733066	eng	No one ever comes to visit me.
3733067	eng	Tom could hurt me.
3733068	eng	I thought you were going to hurt me.
3733069	eng	I didn't want anyone to worry about me.
3733070	eng	Please don't leave without me.
3733071	eng	Tom and Mary won't go without me.
3733072	eng	Don't start without me.
3733073	eng	OK, you two, follow me.
3733074	eng	I've decided to ask Mary if she'll marry me.
3733075	eng	I'm going to ask your daughter to marry me.
3733076	eng	I think I'll ask Mary to marry me.
3733077	eng	No one ever came.
3733078	eng	They're playing a game.
3733079	eng	Tom doesn't understand the rules of the game.
3733080	eng	Tom said that he wasn't to blame.
3733081	eng	It's people like you who give Boston a bad name.
3733082	eng	Tom Jackson wasn't his real name.
3733083	eng	That's an unusual name.
3733084	eng	Tom hated his own name.
3733085	eng	Tom hasn't yet learned how to write his own name.
3733086	eng	I think I just heard someone call your name.
3733087	eng	I still can't remember your name.
3733088	eng	Tom turned around when he heard someone yell his name.
3733089	eng	Tom never remembers my name.
3733090	eng	Tom told me how he got his nickname.
3733091	eng	It's always been the same.
3733092	eng	I hope they have a good time.
3733093	eng	I hope Tom has a good time.
3733094	eng	This isn't a good time.
3733095	eng	Tom is always complaining that he doesn't have enough free time.
3733096	eng	Tom never seems to have any free time.
3733097	eng	I know I should've helped Tom, but I didn't have the time.
3733098	eng	I still think about Tom all the time.
3733099	eng	Tom makes fun of Mary all the time.
3733100	eng	I couldn't do anything about that at the time.
3733101	eng	Tom and Mary entered the library at the same time.
3733102	eng	Tom and Mary talked for some time.
3733103	eng	All Tom needed was a little more time.
3733104	eng	What we need is some more time.
3733105	eng	Doing that is a waste of time.
3733106	eng	I've waited a long time.
3733107	eng	Tom has been living here a long time.
3733108	eng	We've been waiting a long time.
3733109	eng	Tom has been studying French a long time.
3733110	eng	Tom has been sick a long time.
3733111	eng	I haven't had a girlfriend in a long time.
3733112	eng	I haven't eaten Mexican food in a long time.
3733113	eng	I haven't done this in a long time.
3733114	eng	I haven't been to a concert in a long time.
3733115	eng	Tom has lived here for a long time.
3733116	eng	Tom has been in the hospital for a long time.
3733117	eng	Tom seems to have been working on this for a long time.
3733118	eng	Tom had to wait for a long time.
3733119	eng	I haven't been happy for a long time.
3733120	eng	I've been here for a very long time.
3733121	eng	I've been playing golf for a very long time.
3733122	eng	I've been studying French for a very long time.
3733123	eng	I've been sick for a very long time.
3733124	eng	Tom finally got here around lunch time.
3733125	eng	I was just in time.
3733126	eng	I thought you'd be on time.
3733127	eng	Tom thought that Mary would be on time.
3733128	eng	Tom never seems to be on time.
3733129	eng	I tried my best to get here on time.
3733130	eng	I hope you can make it on time.
3733131	eng	Perhaps we can talk about this at another time.
3733132	eng	It's supper time.
3733133	eng	This is a waste of our time.
3733134	eng	Doing that is a waste of your time.
3733135	eng	Tom knows how to make good use of his time.
3733136	eng	They can't do anything at this time.
3733137	eng	I wasn't married at that time.
3733138	eng	I was unmarried at that time.
3733139	eng	Tom was just a kid at that time.
3733140	eng	Tom wasn't working for us at that time.
3733141	eng	I think I'll try a little harder next time.
3733142	eng	Tom never threw away anything that he thought he might be able to use sometime.
3733143	eng	The last time I saw Tom was yesterday around lunchtime.
3733144	eng	Tom has been working overtime.
3733145	eng	Tom knew Mary would come.
3733146	eng	Tom has promised to come.
3733147	eng	Tom might have sense enough not to come.
3733148	eng	How nice of you to come.
3733149	eng	Tom was waiting for Mary to come.
3733150	eng	I should've stayed home.
3733151	eng	I still think we should've stayed home.
3733152	eng	Tom might just as well stayed home.
3733153	eng	Tom will soon be home.
3733154	eng	Tom has gone home.
3733155	eng	Almost everybody has already gone home.
3733156	eng	I must be going home.
3733157	eng	I must be getting home.
3733158	eng	Tom wasn't able to convince Mary to come back home.
3733159	eng	Tom couldn't convince Mary to come back home.
3733160	eng	They've all gone back home.
3733161	eng	We had to walk home.
3733162	eng	They've taken Tom home.
3733163	eng	Perhaps we should go on home.
3733164	eng	We may as well just go on home.
3733165	eng	Tom got tired of waiting for Mary, so he went on home.
3733166	eng	Tom might just as well go home.
3733167	eng	Everybody wanted to go home.
3733168	eng	OK, people, it's time to go home.
3733169	eng	I can tell that you want to go home.
3733170	eng	I really want to go home.
3733171	eng	I think it's time for you to go home.
3733172	eng	I'm tired. Let's go home.
3733173	eng	Tom asked if Mary was home.
3733174	eng	My wife stayed at home.
3733175	eng	Tom knew Mary would probably be at home.
3733176	eng	Tom and Mary were both at home.
3733177	eng	Most fatal accidents happen at home.
3733178	eng	Tom said that he left his wallet at home.
3733179	eng	Tom might prefer to stay at home.
3733180	eng	Tom knew when Mary said she was planning to get home.
3733181	eng	Let's get home.
3733182	eng	Call me when you get home.
3733183	eng	Call me as soon as you get home.
3733184	eng	Tom wasn't feeling well, so he went home.
3733185	eng	You were asleep by the time I got home.
3733186	eng	Remind me to stop by the supermarket on the way home.
3733187	eng	Tom might've eaten on his way home.
3733188	eng	I think you're kind of handsome.
3733189	eng	Give me that cane.
3733190	eng	Don't forget to take your medicine.
3733191	eng	If you want to get well, you need to keep taking this medicine.
3733192	eng	We should be fine.
3733193	eng	The doctor says you're going to be fine.
3733194	eng	Put the key in the ignition and start the engine.
3733195	eng	Tom was the last one to cross the finish line.
3733196	eng	I don't like waiting in line.
3733197	eng	This is a very good friend of mine.
3733198	eng	Tom is a buddy of mine.
3733199	eng	I thought it was mine.
3733200	eng	Tom doesn't drink red wine.
3733201	eng	Tom chose the wine.
3733202	eng	If you're really in love, water tastes like expensive wine.
3733203	eng	That idea of yours was a good one.
3733204	eng	We knew no one.
3733205	eng	I have to agree with Tom on this one.
3733206	eng	I've got to agree with Tom on this one.
3733207	eng	Look at that one.
3733208	eng	This isn't the first time Tom has broken a bone.
3733209	eng	Tom is the only person I know who can play the trombone.
3733210	eng	Tom wanted Mary to forgive John for what he had done.
3733211	eng	Tom was very sorry for what he had done.
3733212	eng	Tom seemed to regret what he had done.
3733213	eng	Tom was satisfied with the work Mary had done.
3733214	eng	Nothing more could be done.
3733215	eng	I want to show you another way that can be done.
3733216	eng	Tom wants to believe it can be done.
3733217	eng	Tom never knew what needed to be done.
3733218	eng	I think you know what has to be done.
3733219	eng	There's so much that needs to be done.
3733220	eng	Let's see what needs to be done.
3733221	eng	You're the only one who can get Tom to do what needs to be done.
3733222	eng	Let's figure out what needs to be done.
3733223	eng	I think you know what needs to be done.
3733224	eng	It couldn't be done.
3733225	eng	Something must be done.
3733226	eng	This must be done.
3733227	eng	Tom might be able to tell us what must be done.
3733228	eng	Come back when you're done.
3733229	eng	Thank you for all you've done.
3733230	eng	Everything that can be done has already been done.
3733231	eng	Mary is having her hair done.
3733232	eng	Show Tom how it's done.
3733233	eng	That's the way it's done.
3733234	eng	We've got the whole afternoon to get this done.
3733235	eng	I did something I wished I hadn't done.
3733236	eng	The police have arrested someone.
3733237	eng	The police did arrest someone.
3733238	eng	My keys are gone.
3733239	eng	Tom noticed that Mary was gone.
3733240	eng	I went somewhere I wished I hadn't gone.
3733241	eng	I thought that you already had an iPhone.
3733242	eng	Let's not talk about this over the phone.
3733243	eng	Tom never goes anywhere without his phone.
3733244	eng	I didn't tell Tom who told me that he'd stolen my saxophone.
3733245	eng	I never liked being at home alone.
3733246	eng	Tom never goes out in his canoe alone.
3733247	eng	I hope we're all alone.
3733248	eng	Tom was sitting all alone.
3733249	eng	I don't want to leave Tom alone.
3733250	eng	Perhaps we should just leave Tom alone.
3733251	eng	Tom wasn't alone.
3733252	eng	Tom just wanted to be left alone.
3733253	eng	I'd rather be left alone.
3733254	eng	Tom warned Mary not to go out at night alone.
3733255	eng	We can't do it alone.
3733256	eng	Tom had hoped to find Mary alone.
3733257	eng	Tom wants to speak to Mary alone.
3733258	eng	Hard work never hurt anyone.
3733259	eng	This isn't enough food to feed everyone.
3733260	eng	Tom says he wants to learn how to play the oboe.
3733261	eng	I never gave up hope.
3733262	eng	Tom tore open the envelope.
3733263	eng	Tom looked for the rope.
3733264	eng	Tom is looking for the rope.
3733265	eng	Ask Tom why he needs the rope.
3733266	eng	Tom asked me to look for some rope.
3733267	eng	Tom asked me to buy some rope.
3733268	eng	Tom isn't the squeamish type.
3733269	eng	Remember where we are.
3733270	eng	That's just how things are.
3733271	eng	I don't know where your keys are.
3733272	eng	Remain exactly where you are.
3733273	eng	I'm looking for the same thing you are.
3733274	eng	You never even told me who you are.
3733275	eng	Not everyone is as considerate as you are.
3733276	eng	Not everyone is as busy as you are.
3733277	eng	Nobody will care.
3733278	eng	Tom didn't seem to care.
3733279	eng	Tom said that he doesn't care.
3733280	eng	Tom rose with great care.
3733281	eng	You're not doing your share.
3733282	eng	It won't take me long to install this software.
3733283	eng	You're not needed here.
3733284	eng	I knew I shouldn't have parked here.
3733285	eng	This couldn't have happened here.
3733286	eng	Wait a second here.
3733287	eng	It's cold around here.
3733288	eng	Everything looks good here.
3733290	eng	I thought you'd be here.
3733291	eng	I don't think I should be here.
3733292	eng	I honestly didn't know Tom would be here.
3733293	eng	Tom knows when he's supposed to be here.
3733294	eng	Make sure to tell Tom what time to be here.
3733295	eng	I didn't tell Tom what time to be here.
3733296	eng	I still don't see why I have to be here.
3733297	eng	Tom wants to know how long we're going to be here.
3733298	eng	Tom ought to have known that Mary wasn't going to be here.
3733299	eng	Is it safe for us to be here?
3733300	eng	I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
3733301	eng	Tom wasn't expecting Mary to be here.
3733302	eng	We'll always be here.
3733304	eng	It must be here.
3733305	eng	There's a mistake here.
3733306	eng	I get the feeling that you don't want me here.
3733307	eng	That's why I came here.
3733308	eng	I don't know why we came here.
3733309	eng	I like to come here.
3733310	eng	I didn't ask you to come here.
3733311	eng	Tipping isn't usually done here.
3733312	eng	There shouldn't be anyone here.
3733313	eng	Remember why you're here.
3733314	eng	I want to know who used to live here.
3733315	eng	Please get out of here.
3733316	eng	Tom has made up his mind to quit working here.
3733317	eng	Something is always happening here.
3733318	eng	I forgot to ask Tom what time he was planning on getting here.
3733319	eng	I don't like living here.
3733320	eng	I don't think I belong here.
3733321	eng	Don't park here.
3733322	eng	I've done well here.
3733323	eng	Everyone is still here.
3733324	eng	The view's good from here.
3733325	eng	The station isn't far from here.
3733326	eng	It isn't far from here.
3733327	eng	There's a good view from here.
3733328	eng	Just get away from here.
3733329	eng	It's been a year since I've been here.
3733330	eng	It's very cold in here.
3733331	eng	It's very dark in here.
3733332	eng	It's very hot in here.
3733333	eng	It's very smoky in here.
3733334	eng	It's very noisy in here.
3733335	eng	Tom wasn't the first person here.
3733336	eng	I live pretty close to here.
3733337	eng	Let's work together here.
3733338	eng	Tom never told me why he was here.
3733339	eng	Tom often brings Mary with him when he comes here.
3733340	eng	No one ever comes here.
3733341	eng	Tom seemed to know a lot about how we do things here.
3733342	eng	I'd better leave before Tom gets here.
3733343	tur	İyileşmesi biraz zaman alabilir.
3733344	ben	আমি অবশেষে টমকে দাবায় হারিয়েছি।
3733345	tur	Ne kadarlık bir iyileşme sürecinden bahsediyorsunuz?
3733346	eng	I'd better go before Tom gets here.
3733347	eng	I want to be ready to leave when Tom gets here.
3733348	eng	I want to be ready when Tom gets here.
3733349	eng	Nobody really wants us here.
3733350	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
3733351	eng	Tom might not know why Mary isn't here.
3733352	eng	We're all right here.
3733353	eng	Put it down right here.
3733354	eng	Something isn't right here.
3733355	eng	I want to know how you got here.
3733356	eng	Tell Tom I'm not here.
3733357	eng	It's beautiful out here.
3733358	eng	I want you out here.
3733359	eng	Tom and Mary won't be happy to see you here.
3733360	eng	No one will bother you here.
3733361	eng	Grass doesn't grow here.
3733362	eng	I thought you were going to let me stay here.
3733363	eng	Everything is ready here.
3733364	eng	Everyone except Tom is already here.
3733365	eng	There isn't anybody here.
3733366	eng	Tom says he doesn't know anybody here.
3733367	eng	Tom doesn't know anybody here.
3733368	eng	It won't be lonely here.
3733369	eng	I think you might be happy here.
3733370	eng	I know why you aren't happy here.
3733371	eng	I was surprised when Tom said he wasn't very happy here.
3733372	eng	I didn't know you were unhappy here.
3733373	eng	I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
3733374	eng	There's absolutely no chance that Tom will be there.
3733375	eng	Nobody seemed to be there.
3733376	eng	Tom wasn't sure when he was supposed to be there.
3733377	eng	Tom might not want us to be there.
3733378	eng	Tom may not be there.
3733379	eng	There were a lot of people there.
3733380	eng	There were plenty of other people there.
3733381	eng	There was no one there.
3733382	eng	Get Tom out of there.
3733383	eng	It's almost always raining there.
3733384	eng	It's still there.
3733385	eng	It was still there.
3733386	eng	Tom might also have been there.
3733387	eng	Tom might've been there.
3733388	eng	Tom might've died if you hadn't been there.
3733389	eng	They're still in there.
3733390	eng	Let's park over there.
3733391	eng	Nobody else was there.
3733392	eng	I have friends there.
3733393	eng	Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
3733394	eng	It's not there.
3733395	eng	We are almost there.
3733396	eng	There wasn't anybody there.
3733397	eng	I was very happy there.
3733398	eng	Tom's house is around here somewhere.
3733399	eng	It looks like you're planning on going somewhere.
3733400	eng	I'm sure my passport is in this room somewhere.
3733401	eng	Tom never took me anywhere.
3733402	eng	Tom couldn't find Mary anywhere.
3733403	eng	It'll be crowded everywhere.
3733404	eng	Tom had to make a fire.
3733405	eng	We don't know what caused the fire.
3733406	eng	Tom was the only person to survive the fire.
3733407	eng	Tom wants to know who you want to hire.
3733408	eng	I've never seen Tom this mad before.
3733409	eng	I've never seen this much money at once before.
3733410	eng	Everything's just like before.
3733411	eng	That had never happened to me before.
3733412	eng	I've never seen so many birds at one time before.
3733413	eng	I think you've been here before.
3733414	eng	Tom never had been drunk before.
3733415	eng	I've never met anyone quite like Tom before.
3733416	eng	I've never seen this design before.
3733418	eng	I've never been on a ship before.
3733419	eng	Tom has been in trouble many times before.
3733420	eng	I've never told anybody this before.
3733421	eng	You've lied to us before.
3733422	eng	I do remember meeting you before.
3733423	eng	I can't remember ever meeting you before.
3733424	eng	Let me explain it once more.
3733425	eng	Please don't say anything more.
3733426	eng	I should've eaten more.
3733427	eng	I wish I could've helped you more.
3733428	eng	I don't need your assistance anymore.
3733429	eng	Tom never calls me anymore.
3733430	eng	I don't even know who you are anymore.
3733431	eng	Tom wants me to tell Mary that she can't come here anymore.
3733432	eng	I don't want to live here anymore.
3733433	eng	Please don't speak French anymore.
3733434	eng	I don't think you should see Tom anymore.
3733435	eng	I'm not going to complain anymore.
3733436	eng	I don't need your help anymore.
3733437	eng	Tom has promised he won't do that anymore.
3733438	eng	Even Tom doesn't do that anymore.
3733439	eng	I don't even think about money anymore.
3733440	eng	You might find something that you like in that store.
3733441	eng	There's no known cure.
3733442	eng	Tom was a failure.
3733443	eng	I'll finish this by Monday for sure.
3733444	eng	Tom wasn't sure.
3733445	eng	I think I understood everything Tom said, but I'm not absolutely sure.
3733446	eng	Meeting you here is an unexpected pleasure.
3733447	eng	That's pure conjecture.
3733448	eng	They looked at the picture.
3733449	eng	Tom looked at Mary's picture.
3733450	eng	Tom insisted on taking my picture.
3733451	eng	Tom is studying agriculture.
3733452	eng	Tom might be harder to deal with in the future.
3733453	eng	Tom never talks about what he wants to do in the future.
3733454	eng	Here's to the future.
3733455	eng	I'm worried about my future.
3733456	eng	I'm very worried about my future.
3733457	eng	I need to get something out of my briefcase.
3733458	eng	Leave a message, please.
3733459	eng	The wheel that squeaks the loudest is the one that gets the grease.
3733460	eng	Tom was the one who broke the vase.
3733461	eng	I want to use these.
3733462	eng	I've always wanted to get my hands on one of these.
3733463	eng	Tom said that he wanted a raise.
3733464	eng	I think it's time we gave Tom a raise.
3733465	eng	We need exercise.
3733466	eng	Tom never expected that Mary would really keep her promise.
3733467	eng	Tom must've forgotten his promise.
3733468	eng	Stop that noise.
3733469	eng	Tom got up early so he could see the sunrise.
3733470	eng	It was a surprise.
3733471	eng	That was a nasty surprise.
3733472	eng	Tom seemed to remember what happened better than anyone else.
3733473	eng	Tom wants to be treated like everyone else.
3733474	eng	I'm different from everyone else.
3733475	eng	I guess both of us wish we were somewhere else.
3733476	eng	No one did anything else.
3733477	eng	I don't want to buy anything else.
3733478	eng	I think you've got me confused with somebody else.
3733479	eng	I need to take your pulse.
3733480	eng	I thought that you had a driver's license.
3733481	eng	Tom was the only one who didn't have a driver's license.
3733482	eng	Tom might not have a driver's license.
3733483	eng	Tom is too young to get a driver's license.
3733484	eng	Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
3733485	eng	Tom wants to get his driver's license.
3733486	eng	Tom isn't making much sense.
3733487	eng	This whole thing doesn't make any sense.
3733488	eng	That's complete nonsense.
3733489	eng	This is utter nonsense.
3733490	eng	Stop this nonsense.
3733491	eng	The situation is tense.
3733492	eng	Tom was very tense.
3733493	eng	I'd probably lose.
3733494	eng	I didn't know Tom and you were so close.
3733495	eng	Tom thinks that I did that on purpose.
3733496	eng	My cat eats like a horse.
3733497	eng	Tom looked at the horse.
3733498	eng	Tom fell from his horse.
3733499	eng	You've probably seen a lot worse.
3733500	eng	I've got nothing you could use.
3733501	eng	Stupidity is no excuse.
3733502	eng	Tom could refuse.
3733503	eng	It's an offer they can't refuse.
3733504	eng	It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
3733505	eng	This is a good place to build a house.
3733506	eng	I don't even have a house.
3733507	eng	Please go back inside the house.
3733508	eng	Tom wouldn't leave the house.
3733509	eng	Tom just wanted to get out of the house.
3733510	eng	Tom rescued the children from the burning house.
3733511	eng	Tom came to our house.
3733512	eng	I shouldn't have gone to Tom's house.
3733513	eng	We went to Tom's house.
3733514	eng	Tom couldn't remember how to get to Mary's house.
3733515	eng	Tom was satisfied with the way Mary cleaned his house.
3733516	eng	I was told you were the one who helped Tom build his house.
3733517	eng	Tom never really wanted to sell his house.
3733518	eng	Tom never let me into his house.
3733519	eng	Tom was the one who built this house.
3733520	eng	I need to finish painting my house.
3733521	eng	It took an hour to paint the doghouse.
3733522	eng	There's the lighthouse.
3733523	eng	It was a hot debate.
3733524	eng	It was a fairly hot debate.
3733525	eng	Tom was surprised when Mary asked him out on a date.
3733526	eng	Pick me up 2:30 in front of the main gate.
3733527	eng	Tom called to say he'd be late.
3733528	eng	Tom said that he'd be late.
3733529	eng	Tom ought to have known that Mary would be late.
3733530	eng	Tom knew Mary would be late.
3733531	eng	I'll call Tom and let him know we'll be late.
3733532	eng	I had a feeling Tom was going to be late.
3733533	eng	I think Tom is going to be late.
3733534	eng	I think Tom is likely to be late.
3733535	eng	Tom made it clear that I shouldn't be late.
3733536	eng	Tom might be a little late.
3733537	eng	I want to know why you're late.
3733538	eng	I thought you were working late.
3733539	eng	It was getting late.
3733540	eng	This isn't the first time Tom has been late.
3733541	eng	We realized our mistake too late.
3733542	eng	It was far too late.
3733543	eng	We realized it too late.
3733544	eng	Tom never explained why he was late.
3733545	eng	Tom told me why he was late.
3733546	eng	Tom was the only one who was late.
3733547	eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was late.
3733548	eng	Tom wasn't sure why Mary was late.
3733549	eng	Tom knew why Mary was late.
3733550	eng	The train was thirty minutes late.
3733551	eng	I know why Tom is late.
3733552	eng	Sometimes you just want to eat chocolate.
3733553	eng	Tom likes peppermint chocolate.
3733554	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't eat everything on his plate.
3733555	eng	Maybe you could be my roommate.
3733556	eng	Tom used to be my roommate.
3733557	eng	I think you've been fortunate.
3733558	eng	I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
3733559	eng	Tom felt desperate.
3733560	eng	Let me concentrate.
3733561	eng	Just let me concentrate.
3733562	eng	Allow me to demonstrate.
3733563	eng	This report seems to be incomplete.
3733564	eng	Everything is white.
3733565	eng	Tom wants Mary to be more polite.
3733566	eng	I should've been more polite.
3733567	eng	Tom isn't very polite.
3733568	eng	This stuff is dynamite.
3733569	eng	I've got some reports to write.
3733570	eng	Tom read the note.
3733571	eng	Tom enjoys playing the flute.
3733572	eng	I wonder if Tom knows how to play the flute.
3733573	eng	This may take a minute.
3733574	eng	Tom says it'll only take a minute.
3733575	eng	Coffee will be ready in a minute.
3733576	eng	I've only got a minute.
3733577	eng	Tom didn't try to argue.
3733578	eng	Let me continue.
3733579	eng	It's almost too good to be true.
3733580	eng	It just couldn't be true.
3733581	eng	It's quite true.
3733582	eng	I've heard that chocolate doesn't make fat. I wonder if that's true.
3733583	eng	I wonder if it's true.
3733584	eng	What Tom said was true.
3733585	eng	What Tom said wasn't true.
3733586	eng	Tom knew what Mary had told him wasn't true.
3733587	eng	That wasn't true.
3733588	eng	I bet that's not true.
3733589	eng	I've already said more than I should've.
3733590	eng	I'll miss this place once I leave.
3733591	eng	There's something that I want to do before I leave.
3733592	eng	I'll miss this place after I leave.
3733593	eng	I haven't said you could leave.
3733594	eng	Perhaps I should leave.
3733595	eng	Tom wanted Mary to understand why he had to leave.
3733596	eng	I've made up my mind to leave.
3733597	eng	It's now time to leave.
3733598	eng	I want to know when you're planning to leave.
3733599	eng	Tom wants to know when we're going to leave.
3733600	eng	Tom seemed reluctant to leave.
3733601	eng	I guess both of us want to leave.
3733602	eng	I get the feeling that you want to leave.
3733603	eng	I have no choice but to leave.
3733604	eng	Tom never wanted Mary to leave.
3733605	eng	We'd better leave.
3733606	eng	I think we'd better leave.
3733607	eng	No matter what, you can't leave.
3733608	eng	Well, that's all I have.
3733609	eng	This is really the last one we have.
3733610	eng	I've made some mistakes that I shouldn't have.
3733611	eng	I feel like a slave.
3733612	eng	I think you've been very brave.
3733613	eng	That seems hard to believe.
3733614	eng	That's almost impossible to believe.
3733615	eng	I don't think Tom knows where I live.
3733616	eng	I'll remember today for as long as I live.
3733617	eng	This is where Tom said he used to live.
3733618	eng	I don't think I have much longer to live.
3733619	eng	This is no way to live.
3733620	eng	I still can't remember where you live.
3733621	eng	Tom may still be alive.
3733622	eng	Tom may be alive.
3733623	eng	The hostages are alive.
3733624	eng	The hostages are all still alive.
3733625	eng	I'm glad I'm alive.
3733626	eng	I think you might need to learn how to drive.
3733627	eng	I really want to learn how to drive.
3733628	eng	Tom wanted Mary to learn how to drive.
3733629	eng	Tom let Mary drive.
3733630	eng	I want to know what time you're planning to arrive.
3733631	eng	Not even Tom knew when Mary was going to arrive.
3733632	eng	Good advice isn't always expensive.
3733633	eng	Good advice isn't expensive.
3733634	eng	Good advice is often not expensive.
3733635	eng	It looks really expensive.
3733636	eng	This is going to be very expensive.
3733637	eng	It was excessive.
3733638	eng	This isn't exactly impressive.
3733639	eng	It was effective.
3733640	eng	My plan was very effective.
3733641	eng	Tom is always secretive.
3733642	eng	There were many problems we had to solve.
3733643	eng	They began to move.
3733644	eng	Don't forget to turn off the stove.
3733645	eng	Tom nearly lost his nerve.
3733646	eng	I was surprised when Tom left without saying goodbye.
3733647	eng	I got lost in the maze.
3733648	eng	Tom never dreamed that he would win first prize.
3733649	eng	Tom gave a sigh of relief.
3733650	eng	I'm feeling a bit stiff.
3733651	eng	Make sure that the gas has been turned off.
3733652	eng	I finally feel like I can take some time off.
3733653	eng	I think it's time we gave Tom some time off.
3733654	eng	I've asked the boss for some time off.
3733655	eng	Tom spends way too much time goofing off.
3733656	eng	The lights are all off.
3733657	eng	The lights are now off.
3733658	eng	Tom never said why he wanted the day off.
3733659	eng	This is exciting stuff.
3733660	eng	This is powerful stuff.
3733661	eng	I'm going to get rid of all this stuff.
3733662	eng	Let me get my stuff.
3733663	eng	Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
3733664	eng	This is from that shelf.
3733665	eng	Tom ought to be ashamed of himself.
3733666	eng	Tom seemed very sure of himself.
3733667	eng	Tom seemed to be enjoying himself.
3733668	eng	I think Tom is enjoying himself.
3733669	eng	Tom was certainly enjoying himself.
3733670	eng	Tom is old enough to decide for himself.
3733671	eng	Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
3733672	eng	We must make sure that Tom doesn't hurt himself.
3733673	eng	Tom never told us much about himself.
3733674	eng	Tom knows better than to go out after dark by himself.
3733675	eng	Tom was able to solve the problem by himself.
3733676	eng	I think we should let Tom go to Boston by himself.
3733677	eng	Tom didn't want to go by himself.
3733678	eng	Tom couldn't have made this by himself.
3733679	eng	Tom never swims by himself.
3733680	eng	Tom should be able to do that by himself.
3733681	eng	I think Tom should be able to do that by himself.
3733682	eng	Get control of yourself.
3733683	eng	If you have a question for Tom, ask him yourself.
3733684	eng	All you care about is yourself.
3733685	eng	Don't repeat yourself.
3733686	eng	Please be careful not to overexert yourself.
3733687	eng	I can't imagine shooting myself.
3733688	eng	Let me look for myself.
3733689	eng	If I had known how to do it, I would've done it myself.
3733690	eng	I don't believe it myself.
3733691	eng	I've seen it myself.
3733692	eng	I know myself.
3733693	eng	I wish I hadn't gone there by myself.
3733694	eng	I wanted to live by myself.
3733695	eng	I want to live by myself.
3733696	eng	Tom enjoys playing golf.
3733697	eng	Everything's taken care of.
3733698	eng	I'm the one who gave Tom that scarf.
3733699	eng	There's a hole in the bag.
3733700	eng	Tom doesn't often beg.
3733701	eng	I really liked the way you sang.
3733702	eng	Tom went on reading.
3733703	eng	Tom thought that Mary wouldn't want him at her wedding.
3733704	eng	Perhaps Tom can sing at our wedding.
3733705	eng	Tom might be able to sing at your wedding.
3733706	eng	I thought you were just kidding.
3733707	eng	Don't be so demanding.
3733708	eng	I think there's a misunderstanding.
3733709	eng	I want to learn snowboarding.
3733710	eng	Boston is worth seeing.
3733711	eng	I think Tom was bluffing.
3733712	eng	I thought Tom was bluffing.
3733713	eng	I think Tom was only bluffing.
3733714	eng	I'd say Tom was only bluffing.
3733715	eng	You're not very encouraging.
3733716	eng	Tom heard his telephone ringing.
3733717	eng	I couldn't help laughing.
3733718	eng	Tom suddenly burst out laughing.
3733719	eng	Tom's computer keeps crashing.
3733720	eng	Tom wasn't sure that they were thinking of the same thing.
3733721	eng	This is the same thing.
3733722	eng	Everyone says the same thing.
3733723	eng	It's the real thing.
3733724	eng	Hero worship is a dangerous thing.
3733725	eng	I hope Tom is going to do the right thing.
3733726	eng	Tom thought that Mary would do that right thing.
3733727	eng	Excuse me, I think you've dropped something.
3733728	eng	I've missed something.
3733729	eng	You've omitted something.
3733730	eng	We might find something.
3733731	eng	This has got to mean something.
3733732	eng	I've forgotten something.
3733733	eng	Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
3733734	eng	Tom has been up to something.
3733735	eng	I think Tom has been up to something.
3733736	eng	I think Tom was trying to tell us something.
3733737	eng	Tom might've caught something.
3733738	eng	I forgot something.
3733739	eng	Tom wants to tell you something.
3733740	eng	Tom wanted to say something.
3733741	eng	They were all waiting for me to say something.
3733742	eng	We said nothing.
3733743	eng	They did nothing.
3733744	eng	Tom might recommend doing nothing.
3733745	tur	Seni Tom'un odasına götüreyim.
3733746	tur	O adamın yüzünde kocaman bir yara izi vardı.
3733747	eng	I've taken nothing.
3733748	eng	Tom seemed to expect nothing.
3733749	eng	We don't need anything.
3733750	eng	I knew I shouldn't have said anything.
3733751	eng	I should've not said anything.
3733752	eng	At first, I couldn't understand anything.
3733753	eng	People might not even notice anything.
3733754	eng	At first, I couldn't see anything.
3733755	eng	Please ask me anything.
3733756	eng	No one could prove anything.
3733757	eng	I can memorize anything.
3733758	eng	This doesn't remind me of anything.
3733759	eng	Tom wasn't sure of anything.
3733760	eng	Tom nodded without saying anything.
3733761	eng	Tom walked past me without saying anything.
3733762	eng	Perhaps I shouldn't have told Tom anything.
3733763	eng	Tom didn't want to do anything.
3733764	eng	They never do anything.
3733765	eng	Nobody's trying to make you do anything.
3733766	eng	I could hardly do anything.
3733767	eng	Tom was ready for anything.
3733768	eng	I couldn't eat anything.
3733769	eng	Tom knows how to make almost anything.
3733770	eng	Tom never complained about anything.
3733771	eng	I'll see what I can do, but I can't promise you anything.
3733772	eng	I was afraid to say anything.
3733773	eng	Tom might've known the answer, but he didn't say anything.
3733774	eng	Tom was the only one who didn't say anything.
3733775	eng	Tom couldn't say anything.
3733776	eng	Tom promised that he wouldn't say anything.
3733777	eng	I think we'd better not say anything.
3733778	eng	I can sell anybody anything.
3733779	eng	Tom didn't actually say anything.
3733780	eng	Tom never told Mary anything.
3733781	eng	Tom never tells Mary anything.
3733782	eng	Tom changed everything.
3733783	eng	Tom fixed everything.
3733784	eng	I'll arrange everything.
3733785	eng	Tom knows how to make everything.
3733786	eng	Wash everything.
3733787	eng	You can't do everything.
3733788	eng	There's an answer to everything.
3733789	eng	I'll pay for everything.
3733790	eng	I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
3733791	eng	You don't have to pay for everything.
3733792	eng	Tom seems to know everything.
3733793	eng	Tom has gone skiing.
3733794	eng	Your hands are shaking.
3733795	eng	Tom opened his suitcase and began unpacking.
3733796	eng	I did some checking.
3733797	eng	Let Tom do the talking.
3733798	eng	Everybody except Tom stopped walking.
3733799	eng	I've been thinking.
3733800	eng	That's just what I was thinking.
3733801	eng	That was just what I was thinking.
3733802	eng	Tom knew exactly what Mary was thinking.
3733803	eng	Tom wanted to quit smoking.
3733804	eng	Tom knew Mary would be at home, cooking.
3733805	eng	Tom is always complaining about his wife's cooking.
3733806	eng	The women stopped working.
3733807	eng	The heater has quit working.
3733808	eng	I know precisely what you are feeling.
3733809	eng	I know exactly what you're feeling.
3733810	eng	Tom pointed toward the ceiling.
3733811	eng	It was quite thrilling.
3733812	eng	Let's go bowling.
3733813	eng	Stop dreaming.
3733814	eng	I don't like swimming.
3733815	eng	I don't want to go swimming.
3733816	eng	There's a guard coming.
3733817	eng	I'll call Tom and tell him we won't be coming.
3733818	eng	Tell Tom I'm coming.
3733819	eng	Tom might think that we aren't coming.
3733820	eng	It's very alarming.
3733821	eng	It's maddening.
3733822	eng	Let's go and see what's happening.
3733823	eng	Something was happening.
3733824	eng	There's no possibility of that happening.
3733825	eng	Somebody's listening.
3733826	eng	No one was listening.
3733827	eng	It was an amazing evening.
3733828	eng	Have a wonderful evening.
3733829	eng	Tom will be here this evening.
3733830	eng	I'll remember this evening.
3733831	eng	I was hoping you'd be able to babysit for us next Monday evening.
3733832	eng	Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday evening.
3733833	eng	It was a lovely evening.
3733834	eng	Tom and Mary eat dinner together almost every evening.
3733835	eng	I've had enough of your complaining.
3733836	eng	Tom came even though it was raining.
3733837	eng	They came even though it was raining.
3733838	eng	It's very entertaining.
3733839	eng	Tom might be able to get your car running.
3733840	eng	Tom says he doesn't like air conditioning.
3733841	eng	Let that be a warning.
3733842	eng	Tom was with me all morning.
3733843	eng	It was a wonderful morning.
3733844	eng	Tom apologized to me this morning.
3733845	eng	Tom was still in his pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
3733846	eng	Tom was still asleep when I left the house this morning.
3733847	eng	Tom was the last one to arrive this morning.
3733848	eng	I saw Tom this morning.
3733849	eng	I go jogging almost every morning.
3733850	eng	I did something I regretted doing.
3733851	eng	I have other things I should be doing.
3733852	eng	I have other things I need to be doing.
3733853	eng	I know what we're supposed to be doing.
3733854	eng	Tom seems to never know exactly what he's supposed to be doing.
3733855	eng	I'll give you an hour to finish what you're doing.
3733856	eng	I can't tell you what I'm doing.
3733857	eng	So tell me what you've been doing.
3733858	eng	I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
3733859	eng	It was Tom's doing.
3733860	eng	I'm not going to need a heavy coat where I'm going.
3733861	eng	I thought Tom might be sleeping.
3733862	eng	Your sister's sleeping.
3733863	eng	Tom has gone camping.
3733864	eng	It's been several years since I've been camping.
3733865	eng	The last time I saw Tom, he was limping.
3733866	eng	Mary held out her hand to show everybody her engagement ring.
3733867	eng	Give me back my ring.
3733868	eng	I don't like what you're wearing.
3733869	eng	To tell the truth, I don't like what you're wearing.
3733870	eng	Stop whimpering.
3733871	eng	Tom pretended not to hear Mary and John whispering.
3733872	eng	You're shivering.
3733873	eng	That was really boring.
3733874	eng	That's the first cockroach I've seen this spring.
3733875	eng	I may not be able to sing as well as Tom, but I can sing.
3733876	eng	Tom taught me to sing.
3733877	eng	Tom didn't sing.
3733878	eng	Prices have been rising.
3733879	eng	I was surprised when I saw you guys kissing.
3733880	eng	Tom noticed that his wallet was missing.
3733881	eng	Everything is missing.
3733882	eng	That must be rather confusing.
3733883	eng	It's really confusing.
3733884	eng	It was amusing.
3733885	eng	It was very amusing.
3733886	eng	I ate something I regretted eating.
3733887	eng	Tom was sweating.
3733888	eng	It's fascinating.
3733889	eng	This is definitely not what I was expecting.
3733890	eng	I shouldn't have skipped the meeting.
3733891	eng	Tom might be able to attend the meeting.
3733892	eng	Tom never explained why he didn't attend the meeting.
3733893	eng	Tom wasn't able to be at the meeting.
3733894	eng	It's quite possible that Tom won't be at the meeting.
3733895	eng	Tom told me why he wasn't at the meeting.
3733896	eng	I'm glad you reminded me about the meeting.
3733897	ben	আমি আমার টুপিটি টমের গাড়িতে পেয়েছি।
3733898	eng	Tom might've forgotten about the meeting.
3733899	eng	Tom must've forgotten about the meeting.
3733900	eng	Tom reminded Mary about the meeting.
3733901	eng	Tom told me that he would be at tomorrow's meeting.
3733902	eng	I think it would be a mistake not to attend today's meeting.
3733903	eng	I think I'll have to attend that meeting.
3733904	eng	I think one of us ought to attend that meeting.
3733905	eng	Tom and Mary were fighting.
3733906	eng	Tom seemed to enjoy watching Mary and John fighting.
3733907	eng	Tom got tired of waiting.
3733908	eng	Thanks very much for waiting.
3733909	eng	It sounds very exciting.
3733910	eng	This might be Tom's handwriting.
3733911	eng	It should be interesting.
3733912	eng	They're interesting.
3733913	eng	Let me show you something interesting.
3733914	eng	It wasn't interesting.
3733915	eng	Isn't it interesting?
3733916	eng	It was very interesting.
3733917	eng	The party was very interesting.
3733918	eng	It was pretty disgusting.
3733919	eng	There's no use arguing.
3733920	eng	I know why you're leaving.
3733921	eng	I was thinking of leaving.
3733922	eng	Tom knew what Mary did for a living.
3733923	eng	Tom knew when Mary would be arriving.
3733924	eng	I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.
3733925	eng	I heard what you were saying.
3733926	eng	I should've paid more attention to what Tom was saying.
3733927	eng	I wish you were staying.
3733928	eng	Tom asked where I was staying.
3733929	eng	People are always dying.
3733930	eng	Tom never seems to spend much time studying.
3733931	eng	Tom spends all his time studying.
3733932	eng	I thought you'd be home studying.
3733933	eng	This is worth studying.
3733934	eng	I guess both of us were lying.
3733935	eng	Tom is afraid of flying.
3733936	eng	Excess of politeness is annoying.
3733937	eng	The baby started crying.
3733938	eng	Tom looks like he might start crying.
3733939	eng	Tom looks as though he might start crying.
3733940	eng	It was worth trying.
3733941	eng	You're not trying.
3733942	eng	Your family is amazing.
3733943	eng	It won't be long.
3733944	eng	It won't take me long.
3733945	eng	Tom didn't stay there long.
3733946	eng	I think you've been in the jungle too long.
3733947	eng	I think you've been in Boston a little too long.
3733948	eng	I think you've been dating Tom too long.
3733949	eng	I think you've been a policeman too long.
3733950	eng	I think you've been living in Boston too long.
3733951	eng	I think you've been in Boston too long.
3733952	eng	I think you've been a therapist too long.
3733953	eng	I've stayed away too long.
3733954	eng	I didn't plan on staying here so long.
3733955	eng	Tom said that he had never planned on living in Boston for so long.
3733956	eng	It shouldn't take us long.
3733957	eng	The rain didn't last long.
3733958	eng	That shouldn't take very long.
3733959	eng	It won't take very long.
3733960	eng	Tom didn't stay in Boston for very long.
3733962	eng	You've been right all along.
3733963	eng	Let's try to get along.
3733964	eng	I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
3733965	eng	This is where I belong.
3733966	eng	Tom felt strong.
3733967	eng	You have your shirt buttoned wrong.
3733968	eng	Tom still doesn't realize anything might be wrong.
3733969	eng	I think maybe you're wrong.
3733970	eng	I don't think you're wrong.
3733972	eng	Apparently, Tom didn't notice anything wrong.
3733973	eng	It was all wrong.
3733974	eng	That was all wrong.
3733975	eng	Maybe I'm wrong.
3733976	eng	It didn't seem wrong.
3733977	eng	I'm willing to admit I was wrong.
3733978	eng	I'm not completely convinced that what Tom said was wrong.
3733979	eng	Tom realized that he was wrong.
3733980	eng	Tom ought to admit that he was wrong.
3733981	eng	Everything was wrong.
3733982	eng	Tom realized what was wrong.
3733983	eng	The way you did it was wrong.
3733984	eng	The way you're doing it is wrong.
3733985	eng	I think you've been doing this wrong.
3733986	eng	Tom wants me to take responsibility for everything that went wrong.
3733987	eng	I still can't remember the words to that song.
3733988	eng	I got married young.
3733989	eng	Everyone here looks so young.
3733990	eng	Tom wasn't young.
3733991	eng	Having fun keeps you young.
3733992	eng	Tom became bald very young.
3733993	eng	Tom has known Mary since they were both very young.
3733994	eng	Tom never expected that Mary would agree to take care of his dog.
3733995	eng	Tom went out for a walk with his dog.
3733996	eng	Tom threw a piece of meat to the watchdog.
3733997	eng	It doesn't look exactly like the picture in the catalog.
3733998	eng	This is a typical blog.
3733999	eng	I hope you don't get an upset stomach.
3734000	eng	I'll get a picture of you giving your speech.
3734001	eng	I don't even know which one is which.
3734002	eng	Tom never lets anyone forget that he's rich.
3734003	eng	Tom never knew Mary was rich.
3734004	eng	They both got rich.
3734005	eng	My parents weren't very rich.
3734006	eng	Tom has never studied French.
3734007	eng	Tom said that he had never formally studied French.
3734008	eng	Tom said that he didn't understand French.
3734009	eng	Tom wasn't aware that Mary couldn't understand French.
3734010	eng	They don't understand French.
3734011	eng	Tom is the only one here who doesn't understand French.
3734012	eng	I was impressed by the way Tom spoke French.
3734013	eng	Three months ago, I didn't even know how to say one word of French.
3734014	eng	Tom seldom makes mistakes when he's speaking French.
3734015	eng	I'm still studying French.
3734016	eng	I know you've been studying French.
3734017	eng	Tom has already begun studying French.
3734018	eng	Tom knew why Mary was studying French.
3734019	eng	I didn't even know Tom could speak French.
3734020	eng	I thought you said you could speak French.
3734021	eng	I thought that you could speak French.
3734022	eng	I have a friend who can speak French.
3734023	eng	You're the only one I know who can speak French.
3734024	eng	Tom might be able to speak French.
3734025	eng	Tom might not be able to speak French.
3734026	eng	I thought that you were able to speak French.
3734027	eng	I really want to learn how to speak French.
3734028	eng	Tom knows how to speak French.
3734029	eng	I wonder if Tom knows how to speak French.
3734030	eng	I don't think Tom knows how to speak French.
3734031	eng	I didn't say I knew how to speak French.
3734032	eng	I didn't even know that you knew how to speak French.
3734033	eng	I've always thought you knew how to speak French.
3734034	eng	Tom never told me he didn't know how to speak French.
3734035	eng	Tom was the only one who didn't know how to speak French.
3734036	eng	You never told me that you didn't know how to speak French.
3734037	eng	Tom might know how to speak French.
3734038	eng	I thought you might know how to speak French.
3734039	eng	Tom might not know how to speak French.

3734041	eng	Tom is the only person I know who can't speak French.
3734042	eng	I know you can't speak French.
3734043	eng	Tom knows Mary can't speak French.

3734045	eng	Tom wasn't the only one in the room that couldn't speak French.
3734046	eng	Tom knew Mary couldn't speak French.
3734047	eng	Tom wanted Mary to teach him French.
3734048	eng	I thought you were teaching Tom French.
3734049	eng	Tom spoke in French.
3734050	eng	Tom and Mary were talking in French.
3734051	eng	Say it in French.
3734052	eng	I don't know how to say what I want to say in French.
3734053	eng	Tom says he wants to learn French.
3734054	eng	Tom says that he wants to learn French.
3734055	eng	Tom might be able to translate this into French.
3734056	eng	Tom told me why he'd decided to study French.
3734057	eng	Tom told me why he wanted to study French.
3734058	eng	Tom never really wanted to study French.
3734059	eng	Tom says he wants to study French.
3734060	eng	Tom wanted Mary to study French.
3734061	eng	I wonder if Tom knows any French.
3734062	eng	I honestly didn't know that Tom didn't know any French.
3734063	eng	It was time for lunch.
3734064	eng	I know what you ate for lunch.
3734065	eng	Tom usually eats a sandwich for lunch.
3734066	eng	We should've brought lunch.
3734067	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
3734068	eng	Tom never goes to church.
3734069	eng	They didn't argue much.
3734070	eng	I think you've been drinking too much.
3734071	eng	I hope you don't drink too much.
3734072	eng	I think you've been hanging out with Tom too much.
3734073	eng	You should be careful not to do too much.
3734074	eng	You shouldn't do too much.
3734075	eng	You should be careful not to help too much.
3734076	eng	It was too much.
3734077	eng	I just hope I didn't bore you too much.
3734078	eng	You should be careful not to say too much.
3734079	eng	I've always been careful to not say too much.
3734080	eng	I shouldn't have bought so much.
3734081	eng	I hadn't intended to say so much.
3734082	eng	Tom didn't eat much.
3734083	eng	Tom never said he would pay that much.
3734084	eng	That's a bit much.
3734085	eng	It wouldn't cost much.
3734086	eng	Tom doesn't really like you much.
3734087	eng	Tom couldn't see very much.
3734088	eng	I get the feeling that you don't like me very much.
3734089	eng	No one likes Tom very much.
3734090	eng	Tom doesn't like our neighbors very much.
3734091	eng	Tom never seems to eat very much.
3734092	eng	I've missed you very much.

3734094	eng	It's obvious that Tom doesn't like Mary very much.
3734095	eng	I'll keep in touch.
3734096	eng	It was extremely high.
3734097	eng	Everything made Tom laugh.
3734098	eng	Tom didn't laugh.
3734099	eng	I think you've practiced enough.
3734100	eng	I think you've been punished enough.
3734101	eng	I think you've said enough.
3734102	eng	Only the best is good enough.
3734103	eng	Only your best is good enough.
3734104	eng	This is still not good enough.
3734105	eng	I think we've heard enough.
3734106	eng	This should be enough.
3734107	eng	The place looked big enough.
3734108	eng	I think you've been here long enough.
3734109	eng	We've been waiting long enough.
3734110	eng	I think we've eaten enough.
3734111	eng	I've been told that often enough.
3734112	eng	That was enough.
3734113	eng	Once is enough.
3734114	eng	Love is enough.
3734115	eng	Being rich isn't enough.
3734116	eng	It isn't enough.
3734117	eng	Obedience is not enough.
3734118	eng	That sounds easy enough.
3734119	eng	Tom might pull through.
3734120	eng	It was tough.
3734121	eng	This is Tom's photograph.
3734122	eng	Tom usually uses credit cards instead of cash.
3734123	eng	I wonder what caused your computer to crash.
3734124	eng	Without bait, it'll be hard to catch any fish.
3734125	eng	Tom looked foolish.
3734126	eng	Tom is very proud of what he's been able to accomplish.
3734127	eng	I'll do as you wish.
3734128	eng	Tom took over the business after his father's death.
3734129	eng	Everybody held their breath.
3734130	eng	Let me catch my breath.

3734480	eng	Tom didn't know what kind of snake had bitten him.
3734481	eng	Tom never seems to have any money on him.
3734482	eng	Tom wants to make sure that doesn't happen to him.
3734483	eng	Tom doesn't like it when people say no to him.
3734484	eng	I promised Tom that we'd help him.
3734485	eng	Tom asked me if I would help him.

3734706	eng	Tom promised me that he'd clean my room.
3734707	eng	I don't have a desk in my bedroom.
3734708	eng	There are three tables in the storeroom.
3734709	eng	There's no one in the classroom.
3734710	eng	Tom never worried about where his next meal was going to come from.
3734711	eng	I wonder who it's from.
3734712	eng	I wonder who this package is from.

3734717	eng	It's only another false alarm.
3734718	eng	I just want to get warm.
3734719	eng	It's unusually warm.
3734720	eng	I think we'd better not go out in this storm.

3734722	eng	I'll do it if I can.
3734723	eng	I don't speak French as well as you think I can.
3734724	eng	You're a good customer, so I'll do what I can.
3734725	eng	Tom wants to get his driver's license as soon as he can.

3734877	eng	It's good to see you all again.
3734878	eng	You've got to make sure Tom isn't late for school again.
3734879	eng	It would be nice to see Tom again.
3734880	eng	I'm pretty sure I'll never see Tom again.
3734881	eng	We might never see Tom again.
3734882	eng	I'm pretty sure I won't see Tom again.
3734883	eng	I'll never mention Tom again.
3734884	eng	I'll write to Tom again.
3734885	eng	I don't ever want to speak to Tom again.
3734886	eng	I just want this to never happen again.
3734887	eng	I can make sure that doesn't happen again.
3734888	eng	I just want to make sure that doesn't happen again.
3734889	eng	Tom wants to make sure that that doesn't happen again.
3734890	eng	This must not happen again.
3734891	eng	I'll never leave Boston again.
3734892	eng	Tom wants me to call Mary and make it clear that he never wants to see her again.
3734893	eng	I don't ever want to do this again.
3734894	eng	Tom filled his glass again.
3734895	eng	I thought you'd never visit us again.
3734896	eng	I won't do that again.
3734897	eng	I'm hoping that Tom never does that again.
3734898	eng	It might be a long time before we meet again.
3734899	eng	We'll meet again.
3734900	eng	It was quiet again.
3734901	eng	Give me back my book. I need it again.
3734902	eng	I thought I'd try doing it again.
3734903	eng	I could do it again.
3734904	eng	Watch me do it again.
3734905	eng	I'll do it again.
3734906	eng	Let me try it again.
3734907	eng	I thought I'd never hear from you again.
3734908	eng	Tom never thought he'd see Mary again.
3734909	eng	That'll be hard to explain.
3734910	eng	It's tough to explain.
3734911	eng	It's too difficult to explain.
3734912	eng	It's difficult to explain.
3734913	eng	I shouldn't have played outside in the rain.
3734914	eng	We had to walk home in the rain.
3734915	eng	I've decided to go by train.
3734916	eng	Tom was in the cabin.
3734917	eng	Tom might not realize what time the meeting is supposed to begin.
3734918	eng	Tom also plays the violin.
3734919	eng	This is where Tom said he found the gold coin.
3734920	eng	Tom pocketed the coin.
3734921	eng	Tom is Mary's second cousin.
3734922	eng	Tom knows that he can't win.
3734923	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was a twin.
3734924	eng	Get a move on.
3734925	eng	There's a war going on.
3734926	eng	I don't quite understand what's going on.
3734927	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
3734928	eng	I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
3734929	eng	I just want to see what's going on.
3734930	eng	Tom didn't quite understand what was going on.
3734931	eng	I couldn't understand what was going on.
3734932	eng	Tom didn't seem to be particularly interested in what was going on.
3734933	eng	I wasn't particularly interested in what was going on.
3734934	eng	Tom wasn't particularly interested in what was going on.
3734935	eng	Tom pretended not to hear what was going on.
3734936	eng	Tom never quite knew what was going on.
3734937	eng	Tom didn't know what was really going on.
3734938	eng	You should put your belt on.
3734939	eng	I don't know what I'm going to do from now on.
3734940	eng	That's a matter of opinion.
3734941	eng	I didn't ask you for your opinion.
3734942	eng	Tom rose to the occasion.
3734943	eng	We still haven't made a decision.
3734944	eng	The jury hasn't yet made a decision.
3734945	eng	I think you've made the wrong decision.
3734946	eng	Both Tom and Mary are in the living room, watching television.
3734947	eng	Tom wasn't hurt in the explosion.
3734948	eng	I don't want Tom to get the wrong impression.
3734949	eng	That's an old-fashioned expression.
3734950	eng	We'll need to ask Tom for permission.
3734951	eng	I still need to ask Tom for permission.
3734952	eng	I shouldn't have done that without your permission.
3734953	eng	Tom never would've asked. He'd just have done it without permission.
3734954	eng	It's a foregone conclusion.
3734955	eng	Tom has just come back from vacation.
3734956	eng	I wonder where Tom is spending his vacation.
3734957	eng	I think you might need to take a short vacation.
3734958	eng	Tom wants his children to have a good education.
3734959	eng	Thanks for this useful information.
3734960	eng	I didn't wait for an explanation.
3734961	eng	I'm not completely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
3734962	eng	You might not be able to play the piano after your operation.
3734963	eng	I have to prepare my presentation.
3734964	eng	I have to prepare for my presentation.
3734965	eng	I thought Tom might be waiting for us in front of the station.
3734966	eng	Tom waited for Mary at the station.
3734967	eng	We explained the situation.
3734968	eng	Tom explained the situation.
3734969	eng	It's an impossible situation.
3734970	eng	Let me explain our situation.
3734971	eng	If Tom wants to stay, I have no objection.
3734972	eng	Tom has a baseball card collection.
3734973	eng	Tom works in construction.
3734974	eng	Tom needs to be the center of attention.
3734975	eng	I should've paid closer attention.
3734976	eng	Tom tried to attract someone's attention.
3734977	eng	We've only got one option.
3734978	eng	Tom repeated the question.
3734979	eng	That's a very interesting question.
3734980	eng	Tom made no attempt to answer Mary's question.
3734981	eng	Don't ask that question.
3734982	eng	I actually know the answer to that question.
3734983	eng	Tom didn't want to answer that question.
3734984	eng	You've answered my question.
3734985	eng	Tom never answered my question.
3734986	eng	This is just a precaution.
3734987	eng	We'll take every precaution.
3734988	eng	Tom says the two of you have a lot in common.
3734989	eng	It began to rain after noon.
3734990	eng	I assume you'll be here this afternoon.
3734991	eng	Tom says that he has to attend a meeting this afternoon.
3734992	eng	I thought you were going to watch Tom this afternoon.
3734993	eng	I wonder what Tom is going to do this afternoon.
3734994	eng	Tom says that he'd like to come over this afternoon.
3734995	eng	I don't feel like playing tennis this afternoon.
3734996	eng	I want you to help us this afternoon.
3734997	eng	Tom was with us that afternoon.
3734998	eng	I was wondering if you could help me tomorrow afternoon.
3734999	eng	Tom said that he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
3735000	eng	Tom told me that he would like me to come over tomorrow afternoon.
3735001	eng	I may be able to come to your office Monday afternoon.
3735002	eng	Tom asked me if I would be free next Monday afternoon.
3735003	eng	Tom usually takes a three-hour nap in the early afternoon.
3735004	eng	Come and see me soon.
3735005	eng	It doesn't look as if that's going to happen any time soon.
3735006	eng	Tom'll be here soon.
3735007	eng	Tom might arrive soon.
3735008	eng	It'll start raining soon.
3735009	eng	Tom might bleed to death if we don't get him to a hospital soon.
3735010	eng	I'll be coming back to Boston soon.
3735011	eng	I might be ready to go soon.
3735012	eng	Tom'll be all right soon.
3735013	eng	You'd better take care of it soon.
3735014	eng	I'll be thirty soon.
3735015	eng	Tom might know how to play the bassoon.
3735016	eng	Tom knew the reason.
3735017	eng	That's the true reason.
3735018	eng	That's the real reason.
3735019	eng	Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
3735020	eng	I did some checking to find out why Tom spent time in prison.
3735021	eng	I don't know how many years Tom spent in prison.
3735022	eng	Be careful not to blame the wrong person.
3735023	eng	Don't blame the wrong person.
3735024	eng	Tom's the best guitarist I've ever heard in person.
3735025	eng	Tom wants to be a better person.

3735027	eng	Basically, I am a honest person.
3735028	eng	I think you've learned a valuable lesson.
3735029	eng	Tom really does like Boston.
3735030	eng	Tom wouldn't like Boston.
3735031	eng	I thought you wouldn't like Boston.

3735071	eng	I know you've been in Boston.
3735072	eng	Tom and Mary are no longer in Boston.
3735073	eng	Tom ought to spend the summer in Boston.
3735074	eng	Tom worked as a truck driver in Boston.
3735075	eng	Tom might run into Mary while he's in Boston.

3735099	eng	Tom hasn't ever been to Boston.
3735100	eng	I don't think you should go to Boston.
3735101	eng	Tom used to often go to Boston.
3735102	eng	I've decided to go to Boston.

3735118	eng	Tom was hiding in the barn.
3735119	eng	There's no reason for concern.
3735120	eng	Tom has always been stubborn.
3735121	eng	Don't be so stubborn.
3735122	eng	This won't burn.
3735123	eng	Now it's our turn.
3735124	eng	Stay here till I return.
3735125	eng	Let's wait for Tom and the others to return.
3735126	eng	This job should be fun.

3735129	eng	That would've been fun.
3735130	eng	I thought it was fun.
3735131	eng	It's great fun.
3735132	eng	It was great fun.
3735133	eng	It wouldn't be any fun.
3735134	eng	Step away from the gun.
3735135	eng	Put down your gun.
3735136	eng	Tom fired his gun.
3735137	eng	Put down that gun.
3735138	eng	I slept till dawn.
3735139	eng	I need to finish mowing the lawn.
3735140	eng	I still need to mow the lawn.
3735141	eng	I think you should do this on your own.
3735142	eng	I think you need to do this on your own.
3735143	eng	Tom wants to move out and find a place of his own.
3735144	eng	Our first proposal was turned down.
3735145	eng	Tom turned the glass upside down.
3735146	eng	Put the rifle down.
3735147	eng	Tom told me that he'd never let me down.
3735148	eng	I put my suitcase down.
3735149	eng	Prices are going down.
3735150	eng	We'll never back down.
3735151	eng	Please write that down.
3735152	eng	Tom wouldn't sit down.
3735153	eng	I think you might need to slow down.
3735154	eng	The cause of the fire is unknown.
3735155	eng	Tom didn't drown.
3735156	eng	I've already promised to show Tom around town.
3735157	eng	Tom never knew that Mary lived on the bad side of town.
3735158	eng	Tom lives in the worst part of town.
3735159	eng	I'm going to town.
3735160	eng	I'm headed downtown.
3735161	eng	I'm heading downtown.
3735162	eng	Tom makes three times more money than I do.
3735163	eng	Tom lives on the same floor as I do.
3735164	eng	Tom has twice as many books as I do.
3735165	eng	I don't know why I remember, but I do.
3735166	eng	There seemed to be nothing we could do.
3735167	eng	There was nothing we could do.
3735168	eng	I wasn't sure what I should do.
3735169	eng	I'll see what else I can do.
3735170	eng	That wasn't what I'd planned to do.
3735171	eng	All we can do now is hope that Tom does what he's promised to do.
3735172	eng	Tom wants to make sure you understand what you're supposed to do.
3735173	eng	I know what I'm supposed to do.
3735174	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand what he's supposed to do.
3735175	eng	I hope Tom is going to do what he's supposed to do.

3735177	eng	It's clear that Tom doesn't know what he's supposed to do.
3735178	eng	Tom wants to make sure Mary knows what she's supposed to do.
3735179	eng	Tom wasn't sure what he was supposed to do.
3735180	eng	That wasn't what I wanted to do.
3735181	eng	Tom knew what Mary wanted to do.
3735182	eng	I couldn't do what Tom wanted me to do.
3735183	eng	There was nothing for me to do.
3735184	eng	I'll do anything Tom wants me to do.
3735185	eng	I don't understand what Tom wants me to do.
3735186	eng	I don't know what else you expect me to do.
3735187	eng	I don't know what you expect me to do.
3735188	eng	I'm not afraid to do what I have to do.
3735189	eng	I think you know what we have to do.
3735190	eng	Tom had something to do.
3735191	eng	Tom wants something to do.
3735192	eng	There seemed to be nothing to do.
3735193	eng	There was nothing to do.
3735194	eng	I have a lot of cleaning to do.
3735195	eng	Tom never said what he was planning to do.
3735196	eng	Tom knew what Mary was planning to do.
3735197	eng	I'm not sure what Tom is planning to do.
3735198	eng	Tom seldom does what he says he's going to do.
3735199	eng	Tom almost always does what he says he's going to do.
3735200	eng	Tom knew what Mary said she was going to do.
3735201	eng	I have a lot of studying to do.
3735202	eng	I couldn't help Tom do what he was trying to do.
3735203	eng	There's so much to do.
3735204	eng	They said they couldn't do what you asked them to do.
3735205	eng	Tom did better than I expected him to do.
3735206	eng	Tom didn't do what I wanted him to do.
3735207	eng	I'll see to it that Tom does what you've told him to do.
3735208	eng	I've already told Tom what he needs to do.
3735209	eng	Tom almost always does what he promises to do.
3735210	eng	Tom said he had more important things to do.
3735211	eng	I don't know what else you expect us to do.
3735212	eng	We still haven't decided what to do.
3735213	eng	Tom didn't tell me what to do.
3735214	eng	Don't you tell me what to do.
3735215	eng	I wasn't sure what to do.
3735216	eng	Tom is tired of people telling him what to do.
3735217	eng	Tom wanted Mary to tell him what to do.
3735218	eng	I don't think Tom knows what to do.
3735219	eng	We're still trying to figure out what to do.
3735220	eng	I already said I don't know what to do.
3735221	eng	I thought Tom might know what to do.
3735222	eng	I think you know what to do.
3735223	eng	I don't know exactly what to do.
3735224	eng	There's so much left to do.
3735225	eng	There seemed to be nothing left to do.
3735226	eng	There was nothing left to do.
3735227	eng	There's so much more I want to do.
3735228	eng	Tom never did anything he didn't want to do.
3735229	eng	Tom makes me do things I don't want to do.
3735230	eng	Tom never does anything that he doesn't want to do.
3735231	eng	It's best if you do everything Tom tells you to do.
3735232	eng	We should try to think of something new to do.
3735233	eng	That's all we ever do.
3735234	eng	Tom wants the same thing you do.
3735235	eng	I like Tom a lot more than you do.
3735236	eng	Not everyone has as much money as you do.
3735237	eng	I feel the same way you do.
3735238	eng	Tom knew what Mary would most likely do.
3735239	eng	I said I'd go.
3735240	eng	I haven't said you could go.
3735241	eng	I thought you were going to let me go.
3735242	eng	We may as well all go.
3735243	eng	Tom might as well go.
3735244	eng	I think I need to go.
3735245	eng	I think you know where we need to go.
3735246	eng	I've promised to go.

3735248	eng	They both wanted to go.
3735249	eng	Tom and Mary both wanted to go.

3735252	eng	I need you to tell me where to go.
3735253	eng	Tom wanted to know where to go.
3735254	eng	Tom made no move to go.
3735255	eng	We expect to go.
3735256	eng	Tom didn't want to go.
3735257	eng	Tom knew Mary wouldn't want to go.
3735258	eng	I can see why Tom doesn't want to go.
3735259	eng	I'm sorry, but I've got to go.
3735260	eng	I'm packed and ready to go.
3735261	eng	Everything's ready to go.
3735262	eng	Tom won't let us go.
3735263	eng	Tom didn't go.
3735264	eng	I need to talk to Tom. The rest of you may go.
3735265	eng	Tom ought to have been here a long time ago.
3735266	eng	I knew about that a week ago.
3735267	eng	Tom should've been here thirty minutes ago.
3735268	eng	I wrote that letter three weeks ago.
3735269	eng	I knew about this three weeks ago.
3735270	eng	Tom graduated three years ago.
3735271	eng	Tom got his master's degree three years ago.
3735272	eng	It was years ago.
3735273	eng	You look just like Tom looked thirty years ago.
3735274	eng	That happened almost thirty years ago.
3735275	eng	That happened about thirty years ago.
3735276	eng	I was in a better mood three hours ago.
3735277	eng	Tom has three sisters. One lives in Boston and the other two live in Chicago.
3735278	eng	Tom has two brothers. One lives in Boston and the other lives in Chicago.
3735279	eng	Tom flipped on the radio.
3735280	eng	Tom didn't regret saying no.
3735281	eng	The answer is still no.
3735282	eng	I thought you said you could play the piano.
3735283	eng	Tom wants to know when you can come over to our place and help us move our piano.
3735284	eng	Tom asked me if I would help him move his piano.
3735285	eng	When Tom saw Mary smile, he smiled, too.
3735286	eng	Let me come, too.
3735287	eng	You'd better come, too.
3735288	eng	My name's Tom, too.
3735289	eng	I would like to go, too.
3735290	eng	Tom wanted to know why he couldn't go, too.
3735291	eng	I thought so, too.
3735292	eng	I like dogs, too.
3735293	eng	I like that, too.
3735294	eng	Tom liked it, too.
3735295	eng	Show me your tattoo.
3735296	eng	Everybody said so.
3735297	eng	That must be so.
3735298	eng	They told me so.
3735299	eng	I've done so.
3735300	eng	It would be nice if that were so.
3735301	eng	I should think so.
3735302	eng	It may have been so.
3735303	eng	Tom didn't exactly say so.
3735304	eng	I didn't want to come, but Tom told me I had to.
3735305	eng	I could do it again if I had to.
3735306	eng	I think you've been lied to.
3735307	eng	Tom knew who Mary said she was planning to get married to.
3735308	eng	Mary is the most beautiful girl I've ever actually talked to.
3735309	eng	Tom still drinks, but not as much as he used to.
3735310	eng	Tom wants to go to college, but he can't afford to.
3735311	eng	I wouldn't have done that if Tom hadn't told me to.
3735312	eng	I'll do it again if you want me to.
3735313	eng	I had to wait a lot longer than I expected I'd have to.
3735314	eng	Tom knew who Mary wanted to talk to.
3735315	eng	Tom told me what you're up to.
3735316	eng	I let Tom do anything he wants to.
3735317	eng	I know who to give it to.
3735318	eng	Tom might recommend that we stay here for a week or two.
3735319	eng	Tom and Mary won't be back for a day or two.
3735320	eng	I'm afraid it's rather cheap.
3735321	eng	Everything is cheap.
3735322	eng	Everything in this store is really cheap.
3735323	eng	I suggest that you take a nap.
3735324	eng	This water is deep.
3735325	eng	The snow's a foot deep.
3735326	eng	Tom dozed off to sleep.
3735327	eng	I thought you went to your room to sleep.
3735328	eng	Tom turned off the light and went to sleep.
3735329	eng	Tom was talking in his sleep.
3735330	eng	Tom didn't sleep.
3735331	eng	Tom still seems to be asleep.

3735334	eng	The men are all asleep.
3735335	eng	They're not all asleep.
3735336	eng	Everyone is still asleep.
3735337	eng	I think everyone is asleep.
3735338	eng	Tom wasn't asleep.
3735339	eng	I helped Tom get ready for his trip.

3735343	eng	I was hoping you could help.
3735344	eng	I think everybody should help.
3735345	eng	I said I would help.

3735347	eng	Tom might need a little help.
3735348	eng	I hope I can be of some help.
3735349	eng	Tom needs some help.
3735350	eng	Tom might want some help.
3735351	eng	Tom needs more help.
3735352	eng	It's not going to be easy to do that without a lot of help.

3735375	eng	I thought you were going to help.
3735376	eng	They're trying to help.
3735377	eng	They're just trying to help.

3735380	eng	There seemed to be nothing we could do to help.
3735381	eng	I'll see what else I can do to help.
3735382	eng	Tom is the one who persuaded Mary to help.
3735383	eng	I think I should've asked for help.
3735384	eng	I tried to leave early, but people kept asking me for help.

3735396	eng	I'm not going to need any help.
3735397	eng	We should call Tom and see if he needs any help.
3735398	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
3735399	eng	I'm afraid you're going to have to do this without any help.
3735400	eng	I think Tom should be able to do that without any help.
3735401	eng	Tom ought to have been a cop.
3735402	eng	Tom never told me he was a cop.
3735403	eng	They all looked up.
3735404	eng	Everybody looked up.
3735405	eng	Get yourself cleaned up.
3735406	eng	I had to wait for Tom wake up.
3735407	eng	The sun has just come up.
3735408	eng	The cost of advertising has gone up.
3735409	eng	Tom wants me to give up.

3735413	eng	I didn't live with my mother when I was growing up.
3735414	eng	We'd better wash up.
3735415	eng	Sooner or later, someone has to speak up.
3735416	eng	Tom didn't even look up.
3735417	eng	Everyone's pretty shaken up.
3735418	eng	The money will turn up.
3735419	eng	Tom wondered what was up.
3735420	eng	Tom wants to be a policeman when he grows up.
3735421	eng	Tom wants to be a banker when he grows up.
3735422	eng	This will cheer you up.
3735423	eng	This is the part of town where I grew up.
3735424	eng	I want to be a teacher when I grow up.
3735425	eng	Tom wasn't one of the group.
3735426	eng	I have to stay with the group.
3735427	eng	I was surprised when Tom bought a round of drinks for everyone at the bar.
3735428	eng	We'll see you at the bar.
3735429	eng	Tom had to rent a car.
3735430	eng	Step away from the car.
3735431	eng	Tom looked into the car.
3735432	eng	I think we'll never be able to afford that kind of car.
3735433	eng	Tom bought a larger car.
3735434	eng	Perhaps Tom can help you wash your car.
3735435	eng	The police found three wallets in your car.
3735436	eng	Tom has been driving his father's car.
3735437	eng	Tom said that he wanted me to help him wash his car.
3735438	eng	Tom wants to sell his car.

3735441	eng	I heard you bought a new car.
3735442	eng	I hear you bought a new car.
3735443	eng	Tom says he wants to buy a new car.
3735444	eng	Tom let Mary drive his new car.
3735445	eng	I can't remember where I parked my car.
3735446	eng	I wish I hadn't loaned Tom my car.
3735447	eng	I'm not going to let Tom borrow my car.
3735448	eng	Stop yelling in my ear.
3735449	eng	This is exactly what I was hoping to hear.
3735450	eng	Tom might possibly say something we don't want to hear.
3735451	eng	I think I've made myself clear.
3735452	eng	Tom's voice was clear.
3735453	eng	Tom visited Mary once a year.
3735454	eng	I was away for a year.
3735455	eng	Tom was in the hospital for three weeks earlier this year.
3735456	eng	Tom has really changed a lot since last year.
3735457	eng	I should've sold my house last year.
3735458	eng	Now you've gone too far.
3735459	eng	This has gone too far.
3735460	eng	I'll show you what I've got so far.
3735461	eng	Tom couldn't jump that far.
3735462	eng	A lot of people drink coffee black with sugar.
3735463	eng	Many people drink their coffee black with sugar.
3735464	eng	I think Tom is a liar.
3735465	eng	It's peculiar.
3735466	eng	Tom tried to open the jar.
3735467	eng	Those two guitars look very similar.
3735468	eng	It was quite spectacular.
3735469	eng	Tom wasn't popular.
3735470	eng	Tom knows how to play the guitar.
3735471	eng	Tom didn't have a case for his guitar.
3735472	eng	Don't touch my guitar.
3735473	eng	Tom and Mary talked about the war.

3735477	eng	Tom couldn't remember.
3735478	eng	Tom is the only one who knows Mary's phone number.

3735500	eng	I guess I'll have to try harder.
3735501	eng	You must try harder.
3735502	eng	Everything seems in order.
3735503	eng	Give me some beer.
3735504	eng	Tom might not drink beer.
3735505	eng	I wonder if Tom likes beer.
3735506	eng	They made Tom an offer.
3735507	eng	Don't make me suffer.
3735508	eng	Tom should be the manager.
3735509	eng	They're still looking for a new manager.
3735510	eng	That's the new manager.
3735511	eng	We think you're in danger.
3735512	eng	We're really in danger.
3735513	eng	Pretend I'm a stranger.
3735514	eng	I think we should wait a little longer.
3735515	eng	I guess I'll have to wait a little longer.
3735516	eng	I think we'd better wait a little longer.
3735517	eng	I should've cooked the pork longer.

3735604	eng	I'll explain it in more detail later.
3735605	eng	Tom'll find out sooner or later.
3735606	eng	I thought I'd do that later.
3735607	eng	Let me add water.
3735608	eng	Leaky faucets waste a lot of water.
3735609	eng	I don't think we should drink this water.
3735610	eng	I think we'd better not drink this water.
3735611	eng	I don't think you should drink that water.
3735612	eng	I've always been a good judge of character.
3735613	eng	Tom looks like a weight lifter.
3735614	eng	Stand up straighter.
3735615	eng	That's Tom's daughter.
3735616	eng	Tom never objected to me dating his daughter.
3735617	eng	You're almost young enough to be my daughter.
3735618	eng	I'm not going to let Tom date my daughter.
3735619	eng	Tom never visits us in the winter.
3735620	eng	I have a friend who can fly a helicopter.
3735621	eng	There's nothing the matter.
3735622	eng	That's what's the matter.
3735623	eng	It's a confidential matter.
3735624	eng	This a personal matter.
3735625	eng	It seems that Tom knows nothing about this matter.
3735626	eng	It's a serious matter.
3735627	eng	We're still discussing that matter.
3735628	eng	You've made everything better.
3735629	eng	Tom won't want to leave town until his mother is feeling better.
3735630	eng	It's getting better.
3735631	eng	I wish that I could speak French better.
3735632	eng	The medicine made me feel better.
3735633	eng	I knew you could do better.
3735634	eng	Your French is getting better.
3735635	eng	I like you better.
3735636	eng	Tom may have read the letter.
3735637	eng	Tom actually was the one who wrote the letter.
3735638	eng	Tom was the one who actually wrote the letter.
3735639	eng	Tom tore up the letter.
3735640	eng	Tom searched all day for the letter.
3735641	eng	I wrote that letter.
3735642	eng	I want to be a taxi driver.
3735643	eng	Tom used to be a race car driver.
3735644	eng	That's all over.
3735645	eng	The concert's over.
3735646	eng	The play's over.
3735647	eng	Tom didn't arrive until the concert was over.
3735648	eng	I'm going back to Boston as soon as this meeting is over.
3735649	eng	The experiment is over.
3735650	eng	The evening isn't over.
3735651	eng	I've been thinking it over.
3735652	eng	We must talk it over.
3735653	eng	The show's almost over.
3735654	eng	Tom has never read the Bible from cover to cover.
3735655	eng	You shouldn't judge a book by its cover.
3735656	eng	Tom opened the drawer.
3735657	eng	Tom took a pair of scissors out of the drawer.
3735658	eng	There are more of those in the drawer.
3735659	eng	Tom put the diary in the drawer.
3735660	eng	I'm in the shower.
3735661	eng	Tom often sings when he's in the shower.
3735662	eng	It really isn't hard to guess the answer.
3735663	eng	You seem to already know the answer.
3735664	eng	There's only one answer.
3735665	eng	Tom walked away without waiting for an answer.
3735666	eng	These are questions that only Tom can answer.
3735667	eng	At least give me a chance to answer.
3735668	eng	Tom didn't want to answer.
3735669	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary's answer.
3735670	eng	Tom isn't a good card player.
3735671	eng	I'm your new lawyer.
3735672	eng	You should always be fair.
3735673	eng	We must be fair.
3735674	eng	Mary has a flower in her hair.
3735675	eng	It's not really all that difficult to cut someone's hair.
3735676	eng	Tom cut my hair.
3735677	eng	Tom took off his coat and put it on a chair.
3735678	eng	I took off my coat and put it on the chair.
3735679	eng	That's my chair.
3735680	eng	That's what I wished for.
3735681	eng	That's exactly what I wished for.
3735682	eng	That's what I asked for.
3735683	eng	Here's the file you asked for.
3735684	eng	Ask Tom what he needs the rope for.
3735685	eng	You've got a lot to live for.
3735686	eng	I think we've found what we were looking for.
3735687	eng	I don't know exactly what I'm looking for.
3735688	eng	This isn't what I was looking for.
3735689	eng	I know who you're waiting for.
3735690	eng	It's not worth waiting for.
3735691	eng	Tom never did anything Mary had to forgive him for.
3735692	eng	Please give Tom everything he asks for.
3735693	eng	I thought we could dye our hair the same color.
3735694	eng	I like Tom's subtle humor.
3735695	eng	The butler opened the door.
3735696	eng	I think I just heard someone knocking on the door.
3735697	eng	Tom came to the door.
3735698	eng	Tom got up and moved towards the door.
3735699	eng	There's no front door.
3735700	eng	I closed my door.
3735701	eng	Tom lives in a penthouse on the 30th floor.
3735702	eng	Tom has always been poor.
3735703	eng	Tom wasn't poor.

3735705	eng	I think we're going to need a doctor.

3735707	eng	Tom might be a doctor.
3735708	eng	Tom's father was a doctor.
3735709	eng	Tom has probably gone to the doctor.
3735710	eng	Consult your doctor.
3735711	eng	Tom is a pastor.
3735712	eng	It took an hour.
3735713	eng	Let's wait an hour.
3735714	eng	I'll give you an hour.
3735715	eng	You've been yawning for the past hour.
3735716	eng	Everybody knows I'm a friend of Tom's.
3735717	eng	I thought it was Tom's.
3735718	eng	Tom has some very strange ideas.
3735719	eng	These are just crazy ideas.
3735720	eng	Tom never gets anything for Christmas.
3735721	eng	Tom wanted Mary to come to Boston for Christmas.
3735722	eng	Tom knew who I was.
3735723	eng	Tom was wearing the same suit as I was.

3735727	eng	Tom might be richer than we thought he was.
3735728	eng	I didn't even ask him what his name was.

3735737	eng	Tom wondered what it was.
3735738	eng	Tom couldn't see what it was.
3735739	eng	That's the way it was.
3735740	eng	Tom might've been in Boston at the same time Mary was.
3735741	eng	Tom wasn't as drunk as Mary was.
3735742	eng	I wonder who that guy was.
3735743	eng	I've never read any of the classics.
3735744	eng	Tom seems to have everything he needs.
3735745	eng	I'll give Tom whatever he needs.

3735751	eng	We're already good friends.
3735752	eng	You said you wanted to make new friends.

3735767	eng	I'll explain afterwards.
3735768	eng	They've seen our faces.
3735769	eng	There were no other choices.
3735770	eng	It depends on the circumstances.
3735771	eng	There are no coincidences.
3735772	eng	Tom is allergic to bees.
3735773	eng	I'd cut down those trees.
3735774	eng	They may have hostages.
3735775	eng	Tom never changes.

3735787	eng	We'll have some difficulties.
3735788	eng	I think you've been watching too many horror movies.
3735789	eng	Tom told me he was afraid of snakes.
3735790	eng	I'm the only one here who isn't afraid of snakes.
3735791	eng	I think I haven't made any mistakes.
3735792	eng	I've made so many mistakes.
3735793	eng	Tom is too stupid to understand your jokes.
3735794	eng	The doctor told me that I needed to eat more vegetables.
3735795	eng	I'm the only one who knows where Tom hid his valuables.
3735796	eng	We gave Tom some apples.
3735797	eng	There aren't any rules.
3735798	eng	Tom spends way too much time playing games.
3735799	eng	I should've done my homework instead of playing games.
3735800	eng	These received no names.
3735801	eng	Tom did it three times.
3735802	eng	They do that sometimes.
3735803	eng	It doesn't matter if nobody comes.
3735804	eng	They're the right ones.
3735805	eng	Tom loves you. I know he does.

3735807	eng	Tom might arrive a couple of hours before Mary does.
3735808	eng	Tom makes three times more money than Mary does.
3735809	eng	Tom only earns half as much money as Mary does.
3735810	eng	Tom looked at his shoes.
3735811	eng	I helped Tom do some chores.
3735812	eng	Tom stared at the pictures.
3735813	eng	Let me show you some pictures.
3735814	eng	Let me show you where you can put your suitcases.
3735815	eng	Take off your glasses.
3735816	eng	It'll just take about three minutes.
3735817	eng	Tom got bored after fifteen minutes.
3735818	eng	I wonder if Tom knows where Mary lives.
3735819	eng	Tom is the only one who knows where Mary lives.
3735820	eng	I thought Tom might know where Mary lives.
3735821	eng	Let's stop fooling ourselves.

3735823	eng	The noise got on my nerves.
3735824	eng	It got on my nerves.

3735828	eng	You have beautiful blue eyes.
3735829	eng	Wipe your eyes.
3735830	eng	Tom seems to be having some problems with his eyes.
3735831	eng	I opened my eyes.
3735832	eng	Tom never really thought about those kinds of things.
3735833	eng	That's an interesting way of doing things.
3735834	eng	Tom didn't have a place to put his things.
3735835	eng	Tom taught me many things.
3735836	eng	Tom didn't want to do anything that might hurt Mary's feelings.

3735844	eng	I'll be in Boston for three months.
3735845	eng	I don't know where your umbrella is.

3735856	eng	Tom is now almost as tall as his father is.
3735857	ben	আজ আমি টমের কাছ থেকে একটি কল পেয়েছিলাম।

3735859	eng	I know whose car this is.
3735860	eng	I know why that is.
3735861	eng	I've never been to your house, but I know where it is.
3735862	eng	Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
3735863	eng	It seems that Tom has no idea where Mary is.
3735864	eng	Tom isn't as naive as Mary is.
3735865	eng	I didn't say I wanted this.
3735866	eng	I'm going to find out who did this.
3735867	eng	I'm going to figure out who did this.
3735868	eng	Try to understand this.
3735869	eng	I'll show you exactly where I found this.
3735870	eng	Wait till you see this.
3735871	eng	I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
3735872	eng	Tom didn't like this.
3735873	eng	I want to use this.
3735874	eng	I don't think we should be doing this.
3735875	eng	I guess both of us know that we shouldn't be doing this.
3735876	eng	Tom would enjoy doing this.
3735877	eng	It shouldn't take us long to finish this.
3735878	eng	I'm sure Tom had nothing to do with this.
3735879	eng	Things can't get much worse than this.
3735880	eng	I thought you were a better chess player than this.
3735881	eng	I want to know why you think we should do this.
3735882	eng	I'm the one who suggested we do this.
3735883	eng	Tom wants to see how we'll do this.
3735884	eng	Please don't force me to do this.
3735885	eng	I need you to tell me how to do this.
3735886	eng	I don't remember how to do this.
3735887	eng	I was told you knew how to do this.
3735888	eng	It's not going to be easy to do this.
3735889	eng	Wait, we can't do this.
3735890	eng	I don't see how Tom could possibly do this.
3735891	eng	I shouldn't have paid so much money for this.
3735892	eng	There's no need to tell Tom about this.
3735893	eng	Please don't say anything to Tom about this.
3735894	eng	I think we'd better not say anything to Tom about this.
3735895	eng	I think I'll need to talk to Tom about this.
3735896	eng	I think one of us ought to talk to Tom about this.
3735897	eng	I thought that you already knew about this.
3735898	eng	Tom might not want us to talk to Mary about this.
3735899	eng	Tom sent you this.
3735900	eng	I don't need to know this.
3735901	eng	Tom is the only one who knows how to fix this.
3735902	eng	I thought you'd enjoy this.
3735903	eng	I think you're going to enjoy this.
3735904	eng	Tom enjoys playing tennis.
3735905	eng	That's an interesting hypothesis.
3735906	eng	This is a major crisis.
3735907	eng	It's hard to teach an old dog new tricks.
3735908	eng	Tom pulled off his socks.
3735909	eng	Tom hasn't changed his clothes in three weeks.
3735910	eng	Tom has been in Boston for the last three weeks.
3735911	eng	I'm willing to wait for a couple of weeks.
3735912	eng	The doctor says you're going to have to stay in bed for a few weeks.
3735913	eng	I haven't seen Tom for a few weeks.
3735914	eng	The eggs I ate this morning both had two yolks.
3735915	eng	I think I'll go see Tom and ask him what he thinks.
3735916	eng	I think I need to ask Tom what he thinks.
3735917	eng	We'll need to ask Tom what he thinks.
3735918	eng	I ought to ask Tom what he thinks.
3735919	eng	I think one of us ought to ask Tom what he thinks.
3735920	eng	I think we'd better ask Tom what he thinks.
3735921	eng	I don't care what anyone thinks.
3735922	eng	I think you've been reading too many comic books.
3735923	eng	Look at the sharks.
3735924	eng	This almost works.
3735925	eng	We're staying in different hotels.
3735926	eng	Tom never uses paper towels.
3735927	eng	Tom rang one of the bells.
3735928	eng	Tom paid all his bills.
3735929	eng	I don't want to do that without the proper tools.
3735930	eng	This box weighs three kilograms.
3735931	eng	I've had my share of problems.
3735932	eng	Tom seemed to be used to these kinds of problems.
3735933	eng	There shouldn't be any problems.
3735934	eng	Hand over your firearms.
3735935	eng	I don't understand what this means.
3735936	eng	They're Canadians.
3735937	eng	There's been a sudden change of plans.
3735938	eng	There's been a slight change of plans.
3735939	eng	I'm hoping that something interesting happens.
3735940	eng	I'll take my umbrella in case it rains.
3735941	eng	Even chocolate contains vitamins.
3735942	eng	Tom told me where he had hidden the old coins.
3735943	eng	Tom showed me his collection of old coins.
3735944	eng	Don't feed the pigeons.
3735945	eng	We didn't reach any conclusions.
3735946	eng	If Tom wants to go, I have no objections.
3735947	eng	We have to follow their instructions.
3735948	eng	We must follow their instructions.
3735949	eng	Tom might be able to make some suggestions.
3735950	eng	They didn't like any of my suggestions.
3735951	eng	Tom didn't answer any more questions.
3735952	eng	I still have a few questions.

3735954	eng	Tom said that the men he saw going into the bank had the weapons.
3735955	eng	Tom might talk to the Jacksons.
3735956	eng	Tom and Mary took turns.

3735974	eng	All four of Tom's grandparents were teachers.

3735983	eng	Come downstairs.
3735984	eng	Everybody's upstairs.
3735985	eng	I haven't met our new neighbors.
3735986	eng	The leaves have changed colors.
3735987	eng	Let's go indoors.
3735988	eng	There are no survivors.
3735989	eng	We had to wait for more than three hours.
3735990	eng	What I need is about three more hours.
3735991	eng	I think we'll stay for a couple more hours.
3735992	eng	I just want to stay here for a couple of hours.
3735993	eng	I thought perhaps you wouldn't mind taking care of Tom for a couple of hours.
3735994	eng	Tom quite often sleeps more than eight hours.
3735995	eng	Tom should be back to normal in a few hours.
3735996	eng	I thought you said Tom was a friend of yours.
3735997	eng	I thought you said Tom was a patient of yours.
3735998	eng	I think my plan is better than yours.
3735999	eng	Tom never seems to pay much attention in class.
3736000	eng	I think I'm going to pass this class.
3736001	eng	Tom poured himself another glass.
3736002	eng	Tom set down the empty glass.
3736003	eng	The show was a success.
3736004	eng	We should give Tom a chance to confess.
3736005	eng	I heard you're pretty good at chess.
3736006	eng	Tom thought that Mary wouldn't be able to beat him at chess.
3736007	eng	I've always been able to beat Tom at chess.
3736008	eng	Tom wanted to play chess.
3736009	eng	It was useless.
3736010	eng	It's perfectly useless.
3736011	eng	I feel completely helpless.
3736012	eng	They've already cleaned up the mess.
3736013	eng	I can't stand rudeness.
3736014	eng	You don't understand business.
3736015	eng	Tom will be in Boston next week on business.
3736016	eng	We need to get down to business.
3736017	eng	Tom wants me to come to Boston to help him set up a new business.
3736018	eng	I can't find Tom's address.
3736019	eng	I think we've made some real progress.
3736020	eng	Tom seems to suffer from some kind of post-traumatic stress.
3736021	eng	It's a wild guess.
3736022	eng	That was a lucky guess.
3736023	eng	That's our new boss.
3736024	eng	I didn't like my boss.
3736025	eng	We have some things we need to discuss.
3736026	eng	We must face the facts.
3736027	eng	There were no more blankets.
3736028	eng	I don't have any pets.
3736029	eng	This area's off limits.
3736030	eng	I thought we could discuss this like mature adults.
3736031	eng	Tom seemed to be satisfied with the results.
3736032	eng	I'll give Tom whatever he wants.
3736033	eng	I'll give Tom as much time as he wants.
3736034	eng	Tom wants to make sure we understand what he wants.
3736035	eng	I think we should let Tom do what he wants.
3736036	eng	Tom seems to know what he wants.
3736037	eng	I'm not sure what Tom wants.
3736038	eng	Tom might know what Mary wants.
3736039	eng	There's no one here who can translate these documents.
3736040	eng	Children imitate their parents.
3736041	eng	Children often imitate their parents.
3736042	eng	Tom seldom goes to concerts.
3736043	eng	Tom spends all his time thinking about sports.
3736044	eng	I'll pay whatever it costs.
3736045	eng	Tom might be allergic to peanuts.
3736046	eng	Tom may have heard us.
3736047	eng	They didn't see us.
3736048	eng	Tom says that he doesn't blame us.
3736049	eng	Tom doesn't blame us.
3736050	eng	Someone has been here before us.
3736051	eng	I've always known that someday Tom would leave us.
3736052	eng	Tom would never forgive us.
3736053	eng	This is a difficult time for all of us.
3736054	eng	Tom now cooks for all of us.
3736055	eng	This is a special day for all of us.
3736056	eng	Thanks for inviting us.
3736057	eng	Tom says that he wants to come with us.
3736058	eng	I don't see any reason why you can't come with us.
3736059	eng	We all wish you were here with us.
3736060	eng	I thought you were going to live with us.
3736061	eng	Tom seemed to enjoy being with us.
3736062	eng	Tom never seems to enjoy being with us.
3736063	eng	I don't think Tom wants to go swimming with us.
3736064	eng	I know why you aren't going with us.
3736065	eng	Tom might have liked to play volleyball with us.
3736066	eng	Tom used to play volleyball with us.
3736067	eng	I thought you were coming to the mall with us.
3736068	eng	Tom told me he was not at all interested in going to the museum with us.
3736069	eng	Tom never said he would go to Boston with us.
3736070	eng	Tom has promised to go to Boston with us.
3736071	eng	Tom never told me he wanted to go to Boston with us.
3736072	eng	Tom says he wants to go to Boston with us.
3736073	eng	Tom might want to go to Boston with us.
3736074	eng	Tom never said he'd go with us.
3736075	eng	Tom would've liked to go with us.
3736076	eng	Tom might've liked to go with us.
3736078	eng	I thought that you said you wanted to go with us.
3736079	eng	I thought that you wanted to go with us.
3736080	eng	Tom never really wanted to go with us.
3736081	eng	I thought you were going to go with us.
3736082	eng	I still need to see if Tom wants to go with us.
3736083	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
3736084	eng	I thought you wouldn't want to go with us.
3736085	eng	I knew you wouldn't want to go with us.
3736086	eng	Tom won't want to go with us.
3736087	eng	Tom is the only one who knows why Mary doesn't want to go with us.
3736088	eng	I thought Tom might want to go with us.
3736089	eng	I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
3736090	eng	You can't go with us.
3736091	eng	Tom might not go with us.
3736092	eng	Tom was with us.
3736093	eng	Tom wasn't with us.
3736094	eng	Tom used to hang out with us.
3736095	eng	Tom won't fail us.
3736096	eng	Tom might not have seen us.
3736097	eng	This building belongs to us.
3736098	eng	I thought perhaps you could help us.
3736099	pol	Tom miał wielu przyjaciół.
3736100	eng	Tom never said he would help us.
3736101	eng	Tom told me that he would help us.
3736102	eng	I wish you would stick around and help us.
3736103	eng	Tom has promised to help us.
3736104	eng	I thought Tom might be able to help us.
3736105	eng	I think you might be able to help us.
3736106	eng	Tom might not be able to help us.
3736107	eng	I know you don't have time to help us.
3736108	eng	I'm sure Tom will be willing to help us.
3736109	eng	Tom was willing to help us.
3736110	eng	I hope Tom is going to help us.
3736111	eng	It should be possible to get Tom to help us.
3736112	eng	It's a pity we can't get Tom to help us.
3736113	eng	I'm hoping that Tom will volunteer to help us.
3736114	eng	Tom made it clear that he didn't want to help us.
3736115	eng	Tom might be able to convince Mary to help us.
3736116	eng	I knew you wouldn't help us.
3736117	eng	I'm sure Tom won't help us.
3736118	eng	There's nothing to stop us.
3736119	eng	There's a place for us.
3736120	eng	Thank you for all you've done for us.
3736121	eng	Tom made it clear that he didn't want to work for us.
3736122	eng	Tom cooks for us.
3736123	eng	They're going to do it for us.
3736124	eng	Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
3736125	eng	Tom never said he would babysit for us.
3736126	eng	Nobody really wants us.
3736127	eng	Everyone's looking at us.
3736128	eng	Tom might've forgotten about us.
3736129	eng	Tom never even saw us.
3736130	eng	Tom used to drive a bus.
3736131	eng	I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
3736132	eng	Everything smells so delicious.
3736134	eng	I don't see anything suspicious.
3736135	eng	Laughter is contagious.
3736136	eng	I hope it's nothing serious.
3736137	eng	Now it's serious.
3736138	eng	It was serious.
3736139	eng	I'm rather curious.
3736140	eng	It's rather curious.
3736141	eng	That's curious.
3736142	eng	I'm really curious.
3736143	eng	It made me furious.
3736144	eng	Tom is very cautious.
3736145	eng	Tom seemed anxious.
3736146	eng	This place is fabulous.
3736147	eng	I think that's ridiculous.
3736148	eng	This could be dangerous.
3736149	eng	Tom may be dangerous.
3736150	eng	Bears are quite dangerous.
3736151	eng	That man is dangerous.
3736152	eng	Bears are very dangerous.
3736153	eng	Tom has been most than generous.
3736154	eng	Tom isn't only friendly, he's also generous.
3736155	eng	I think you've been very generous.
3736156	eng	Don't be presumptuous.
3736157	eng	Tom seemed nervous.
3736158	eng	You're making Tom nervous.
3736159	eng	Tom seemed rather nervous.
3736160	eng	Tom felt very nervous.
3736161	eng	That's bad news.
3736162	eng	No news is a good news.
3736163	eng	Here's some good news.
3736164	eng	We got the news.
3736165	eng	Well, I have some news.
3736166	eng	Tom opened the bedroom windows.
3736167	ben	আমি এখনো আমার কন্ট্যাক্ট লেন্সটি পাইনি।
3736168	eng	I think no one knows.
3736169	eng	I've decided to stay in Boston for a few more days.
3736170	eng	I think I'll stay for a few more days.
3736171	eng	Anything seemed possible back in those days.
3736172	eng	Tom might have to stay here for a couple of days.
3736173	eng	Tom stayed for several days.
3736174	eng	Tom stayed with us for several days.
3736175	eng	I think you're going to want to take it easy for a few days.
3736176	eng	The zoo is closed on Mondays.
3736177	eng	I'm not usually in the office on Mondays.
3736178	eng	I'm not usually at home on Mondays.
3736179	eng	I'm not usually this busy on Mondays.
3736180	eng	Let's see what Tom says.
3736181	eng	There is some truth in what Tom says.
3736182	eng	Tom never pays much attention to what his teacher says.
3736183	eng	The train was on time today, as always.
3736184	eng	I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
3736185	eng	I still can't remember where I put my keys.
3736186	eng	I forget where I put my keys.
3736187	eng	They weren't all boys.
3736188	eng	Tom seemed older and more mature than the other boys.
3736189	eng	These are my boys.
3736190	eng	There was nothing for me to eat.
3736191	eng	Tom never told me what he wanted to eat.
3736192	eng	I'll see what else I can find to eat.
3736193	eng	They may need something to eat.
3736194	eng	I just want to get something to eat.
3736195	eng	I really want to get something to eat.
3736196	eng	There was nothing to eat.
3736197	eng	I think we've had enough to eat.
3736198	eng	I think I'll go out to eat.
3736199	eng	The engine's starting to overheat.
3736200	eng	I heard you don't eat meat.
3736201	eng	Tom still doesn't eat meat.
3736202	eng	That would've been great.
3736203	eng	This coffee tastes great.
3736204	eng	This car runs great.
3736205	eng	That would be a treat.
3736206	eng	We're getting fat.
3736207	eng	I think I'm fat.
3736208	eng	Tom wasn't fat.
3736209	eng	That was a good hat.
3736210	eng	It's not very often that someone buys a thousand dollar hat.
3736211	eng	I forget where I put my hat.
3736212	eng	I shouldn't have downloaded that.
3736213	eng	Tom wouldn't have liked that.
3736214	eng	We've already settled that.
3736215	eng	Tom admitted that.
3736216	eng	Please forget I said that.
3736217	eng	I didn't say I did that.
3736218	eng	Tom might possibly have been the one who did that.
3736219	eng	I'm not the one who did that.
3736220	eng	Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
3736221	eng	Tom understood that.
3736222	eng	I can see that.
3736223	eng	It should be possible to change that.
3736224	eng	Don't give up like that.
3736225	eng	It's always like that.
3736226	eng	Tom didn't like that.
3736227	eng	Tom wasn't like that.
3736228	eng	I bet Tom never kissed you like that.
3736229	eng	I bet Tom never spoke to you like that.
3736230	eng	I bet you know who told me that.
3736231	eng	Perhaps I shouldn't have done that.
3736232	eng	I wish I hadn't done that.
3736233	eng	Tom hasn't done that.
3736234	eng	I'm glad of that.
3736235	eng	I thought you'd already taken care of that.
3736236	eng	I've thought of that.
3736237	eng	I've always hated doing that.
3736238	eng	I'm the one who should be doing that.
3736239	eng	Tom doesn't like doing that.
3736240	eng	I can't imagine doing that.
3736241	eng	Tom never had any intention of doing that.
3736242	eng	I didn't plan on doing that.
3736243	eng	I'm sure Tom had something to do with that.
3736244	eng	Tom might have something to do with that.
3736245	eng	Tom knew about all that.
3736246	eng	I've already told Tom that.
3736247	eng	I'm the one who gave Tom that.
3736248	eng	I don't think you should tell Tom that.
3736249	eng	I must tell Tom that.
3736250	eng	They did mean that.
3736251	eng	I thought Tom had more sense than that.
3736252	eng	You can do better than that.
3736253	eng	I thought you were a better guitar player than that.
3736254	eng	Tom was interested in that.
3736255	eng	Tom could explain that.
3736256	eng	I've always known that.
3736257	eng	I couldn't help Tom do that.
3736258	eng	I hope that I can do that.
3736259	eng	I'm the only one who can do that.
3736260	eng	I'm the only one here who can do that.
3736261	eng	Tom never had to do that.
3736262	eng	I'm trying to figure out how you managed to do that.
3736263	eng	You aren't allowed to do that.
3736264	eng	I think you're stupid to do that.
3736265	eng	I thought I'd have another chance to do that.
3736266	eng	They don't like to do that.
3736267	eng	Tom doesn't like to do that.
3736268	eng	I wouldn't have expected Tom to be able to do that.
3736269	eng	I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
3736270	eng	I knew you wouldn't be able to do that.
3736271	eng	Tom won't be able to do that.
3736272	eng	Tom might be able to do that.
3736273	eng	I think you'll not be able to do that.
3736274	eng	Tom might've been able to do that.
3736275	eng	It should be possible to do that.
3736276	eng	I think I have about enough time to do that.
3736277	eng	I have no desire to do that.
3736278	eng	Tom thought that Mary wouldn't have to do that.
3736279	eng	Tom might think that we want him to do that.
3736280	eng	I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
3736281	eng	I had completely forgotten to do that.
3736282	eng	Tom seems hesitant to do that.
3736283	eng	I can't understand why Tom would want to do that.
3736284	eng	Tom must've known Mary wouldn't want to do that.
3736285	eng	I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
3736286	eng	I don't understand why you want to do that.
3736287	eng	We've already decided not to do that.
3736288	eng	Tom told me not to do that.
3736289	eng	I never asked you to do that.
3736290	eng	I never advised you to do that.
3736291	eng	I didn't tell you to do that.
3736292	eng	There's really no need for you to do that.
3736293	eng	Tom might be able to tell us how to do that.
3736294	eng	I want to show you how to do that.
3736295	eng	I know how to do that.
3736296	eng	I think I know how to do that.
3736297	eng	Tom is supposed to know how to do that.
3736298	eng	I already said I don't know how to do that.
3736299	eng	I'm sure there's a better way to do that.
3736300	eng	Let me show you a better way to do that.
3736301	eng	I know a better way to do that.
3736302	eng	I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
3736303	eng	Tom might be able to convince Mary to do that.
3736304	eng	Tom never for one instant thought of trying to convince Mary to do that.
3736305	eng	Tom might try to convince Mary to do that.
3736306	eng	We'll never do that.
3736307	eng	Tom won't let us do that.
3736308	eng	Tom made it clear that I shouldn't do that.
3736309	eng	Let me tell you why you shouldn't do that.
3736310	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't do that.
3736311	eng	I just won't do that.
3736312	eng	Even Tom doesn't do that.
3736313	eng	What I want to know is how did you do that.
3736314	eng	I was just going to suggest that you do that.
3736315	eng	I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
3736316	eng	Tom never had any intention of letting Mary do that.
3736317	eng	Tom never would agree to that.
3736318	eng	I don't object to that.
3736319	eng	I'm sure Tom will be glad to hear that.
3736320	eng	Tom isn't going to be happy to hear that.
3736321	eng	I was prepared for that.
3736322	eng	It's too soon for that.
3736323	eng	I don't think Tom knows that.
3736324	eng	Everyone says that.
3736325	eng	I don't think you should eat that.
3736326	eng	Please don't make me eat that.
3736327	eng	Please don't force me to eat that.
3736328	eng	I can't forget that.
3736329	eng	I'll not forget that.
3736330	eng	Tom would never admit that.
3736331	eng	I thought you wouldn't want that.
3736332	eng	There's no mistake about that.
3736333	eng	Nothing could be done about that.
3736334	eng	I remember something about that.
3736335	eng	Tom never said anything about that.
3736336	eng	I don't want to know anything about that.
3736337	eng	I thought it was strange that Tom didn't say anything about that.
3736338	eng	Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
3736339	eng	Tom is wrong about that.
3736340	eng	I think you might need to talk to Tom about that.
3736341	eng	I want you to talk to Tom about that.
3736342	eng	There's no doubt about that.
3736343	eng	Tom was right about that.
3736344	eng	Perhaps Tom was right about that.
3736345	eng	Tom wasn't right about that.
3736346	eng	Let me show you where to put that.
3736347	eng	I didn't intend to tell you that.
3736348	eng	Everybody knew that.
3736349	eng	Don't let Tom know that.
3736350	eng	Tom might be able to fix that.
3736351	eng	I know how to fix that.
3736352	eng	They all say that.
3736353	eng	I had a feeling Tom was going to say that.
3736354	eng	Tom ought to have known better than to say that.
3736355	eng	I'm still not sure what you mean by that.
3736356	eng	It wasn't only that.
3736357	eng	I won't deny that.
3736358	eng	I knew you'd enjoy that.
3736359	eng	The dog was asleep on the mat.
3736360	eng	I took off my coat.
3736361	eng	Here's a fun fact.
3736362	eng	I've already signed the contract.
3736363	eng	It looks perfect.
3736364	eng	Tom might object.
3736365	eng	That wasn't my object.
3736366	eng	Tom has published many papers on the subject.
3736367	eng	It didn't take too much time for us to finish the project.
3736368	eng	Tom was correct.
3736369	eng	We must make sure that this information is correct.
3736370	eng	I think this translation isn't correct.
3736371	eng	I think this translation is incorrect.
3736372	eng	I acted on instinct.
3736373	eng	Wearing shoes that are too small is bad for your feet.
3736374	eng	I know who you're supposed to meet.
3736375	eng	Tom lives in an old building on Park Street.
3736376	eng	Tom took me to my favorite restaurant on Park Street.
3736377	eng	The accident happened on a side street.
3736378	eng	I really wish you'd be quiet.
3736379	eng	I need you to be quiet.
3736380	eng	I'll just keep quiet.
3736381	eng	Everyone was very quiet.
3736382	eng	It was very quiet.
3736383	eng	It seemed pretty quiet.
3736384	eng	Tom is wearing a jacket.
3736385	eng	Tom has gone to the supermarket.
3736386	eng	Mary took off her bracelet.
3736387	eng	Tom never suspected that Mary was the one who had stolen his wallet.
3736388	eng	I really do believe Tom knows who stole my wallet.
3736389	eng	I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
3736390	eng	I'm glad we met.
3736391	eng	It's been a while since the last time we met.
3736392	eng	I wasn't married when we first met.
3736393	eng	Actually, we've already met.
3736394	eng	Tom might've been injured much worse if he hadn't been wearing a helmet.
3736395	eng	Tom wants Mary to learn how to play the trumpet.
3736396	eng	Tom knew Mary's secret.
3736397	eng	I've come up with a new set.
3736398	eng	Tom searched inside the closet.
3736399	eng	I think you know what's in the closet.
3736400	eng	Tom might be a little upset.
3736401	eng	I know why you're upset.
3736402	eng	Tom isn't married yet.
3736403	eng	There's still one more question that you haven't answered yet.
3736404	eng	I haven't shaved yet.
3736405	eng	I haven't opened the package yet.
3736406	eng	Tom isn't awake yet.
3736407	eng	You don't even know my name yet.
3736408	eng	Hasn't Tom come home yet?
3736409	eng	I haven't told anyone yet.
3736410	eng	You haven't put anything in your suitcase yet.
3736411	eng	Tom hasn't gotten his driver's license yet.
3736412	eng	We don't need to leave yet.
3736413	eng	I haven't seen anything yet.
3736414	eng	The kettle isn't boiling yet.
3736415	eng	The water isn't boiling yet.

3736426	eng	I don't think I'm ready to go yet.
3736427	eng	I'm not ready to go yet.
3736428	eng	The day isn't over yet.
3736429	eng	The honeymoon's not over yet.
3736430	eng	I'm not famous yet.
3736431	eng	I haven't had time to do that yet.
3736432	eng	I haven't opened it yet.
3736433	eng	I haven't had time to write the report yet.
3736434	eng	Tom hasn't kissed Mary yet.
3736435	eng	I feel a draft.
3736436	eng	Tom's office is the third door on the left.
3736437	eng	I haven't been happy since Tom left.
3736438	eng	There aren't very many apples left.
3736439	eng	I was surprised when Tom didn't thank me for the gift.
3736440	eng	Health is the greatest gift.
3736441	eng	They're open till eight.
3736442	eng	I need to lose a little weight.
3736443	eng	I'm going to try to lose a little weight.
3736444	eng	I'm going to try to lose some weight.
3736445	eng	I don't think I need to lose weight.
3736447	eng	Tom might be a little overweight.
3736448	eng	I think I'm not too overweight.
3736449	eng	Get up and fight.
3736450	eng	It wasn't me who started the fight.
3736451	eng	I heard you and Tom had a big fight.
3736452	eng	We're ready to fight.
3736453	eng	Tom can really fight.
3736454	eng	I saw the light.
3736455	eng	You and I'll be on the same flight.
3736456	eng	They worked all night.
3736457	eng	Tom didn't talk to Mary all night.
3736458	eng	It was a warm night.
3736459	eng	I don't like it when Tom stays out late at night.
3736460	eng	Tom never goes out at night.
3736461	eng	I never slept that night.
3736462	eng	It was a hot night.
3736463	eng	Tom never came home last night.
3736464	eng	Tom wasn't at home last night.
3736465	eng	Somebody broke in here last night.
3736466	eng	Tom snuck out of the house last night.
3736467	eng	Tom never said who he was with last night.
3736468	eng	Mary looked beautiful last night.
3736469	eng	We saw Tom last night.
3736470	eng	I didn't think it would rain last night.
3736471	eng	I didn't drink any beer last night.
3736472	eng	I thought that you were going to come over last night.
3736473	eng	Tom was cranky last night.
3736474	eng	I think we'll have a party next Friday night.
3736475	eng	It was after midnight.
3736476	eng	It's almost midnight.
3736477	eng	Tom almost died tonight.
3736478	eng	Tom nearly died tonight.
3736479	eng	Tom wants to know if you're free tonight.
3736480	eng	Tom might be working overtime tonight.
3736481	eng	I have to work overtime tonight.
3736482	eng	I don't want to do anything tonight.
3736483	eng	I want to know who you're going out with tonight.
3736484	eng	I thought you were going to the carnival with Tom tonight.
3736485	eng	Tom was by far the best singer tonight.
3736486	eng	Tom says I have to babysit tonight.
3736487	eng	Tom might not be at Mary's party tonight.
3736488	eng	Everything seemed right.
3736489	eng	Everyone can't be right.
3736490	eng	Tom pointed to the right.
3736491	eng	It's not quite right.
3736492	eng	I hope it'll be all right.
3736493	eng	Tom said you'll be all right.
3736494	eng	I just hope Tom and Mary are all right.
3736495	eng	Well, that's all right.
3736496	eng	It didn't seem right.
3736497	eng	The creek's to our right.
3736499	eng	I knew I was right.
3736500	eng	Perhaps Tom was right.
3736501	eng	I want you to know that Tom was right.
3736502	eng	I'm not convinced that Tom is right.
3736503	eng	What's right is right.
3736504	eng	I hope I got that right.
3736505	eng	You were actually right.
3736506	eng	It was an awful sight.
3736507	eng	There's still no end in sight.
3736508	eng	Love can't be bought.
3736509	eng	It isn't what I thought.
3736510	eng	There's a nice thought.
3736512	eng	We all noticed it.
3736513	eng	You can ask for help if you need it.
3736514	eng	I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
3736515	eng	Tom just did it.
3736516	eng	Show me how you did it.
3736517	eng	I couldn't stand it.
3736518	eng	I couldn't understand it.
3736519	eng	Tom couldn't understand it.
3736520	eng	I wouldn't have such a good job if you hadn't help me find it.
3736521	eng	Tom couldn't find it.
3736522	eng	I want to know what's behind it.
3736523	eng	I think we found it.
3736524	eng	I've looked everywhere, but I still haven't found it.
3736525	eng	I've never heard it.
3736526	eng	I'll chance it.
3736527	eng	I think we made it.
3736528	eng	Tom couldn't see it.
3736529	eng	We'll manage it.
3736530	eng	We can take it.
3736531	eng	Tom will come back when he feels like it.
3736532	eng	Tom will tell you when he feels like it.
3736533	eng	Tom just didn't like it.
3736534	eng	Tom wouldn't like it.
3736535	eng	I should've known you wouldn't like it.
3736536	eng	Tom might not like it.
3736537	eng	If I had known it was going to bother you, I wouldn't have done it.
3736538	eng	I know you'll love it.
3736539	eng	I'll try to memorize it.
3736540	eng	I've heard of it.
3736541	eng	If you like, I can get Tom to take care of it.
3736542	eng	Tom wouldn't hear of it.
3736543	eng	I saw Tom doing it.
3736544	eng	We're still discussing it.
3736545	eng	I promise I'll give this back to you as soon as I've finished using it.
3736546	eng	Perhaps it was worth it.
3736547	eng	Tom didn't feel it.
3736548	eng	We have seen it.
3736549	eng	I think the box has something in it.
3736550	eng	Someone will do it.
3736551	eng	I saw Tom do it.
3736553	eng	I'm sure Tom can do it.
3736554	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom can do it.
3736555	eng	Tom should be able to do it.
3736556	eng	I think you'll be able to do it.
3736557	eng	I thought you were going to be able to do it.
3736558	eng	I know what I should've done, but I just didn't have enough time to do it.
3736559	eng	Tom doesn't trust anyone else to do it.
3736560	eng	They're going to do it.
3736561	eng	Tom had no idea how to do it.
3736562	eng	Tom didn't quite understand how to do it.
3736563	eng	Tom didn't tell me how to do it.
3736564	eng	I think you know how to do it.
3736565	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary how to do it.
3736566	eng	Tom tried to show Mary how to do it.
3736567	rus	Сегодня вечером Том собирается поужинать с Марией.
3736568	pol	Ktoś to zrobi.
3736569	pol	Widzieliśmy to.
3736570	pol	Widzieliśmy go.
3736571	eng	There's a way to do it.
3736572	eng	This is obviously not the best way to do it.
3736573	eng	Tom will get used to it.
3736574	eng	We're still checking into it.
3736575	eng	I must look into it.
3736576	eng	We can't help it.
3736577	eng	You couldn't help it.
3736578	eng	I couldn't bear it.
3736579	eng	I do remember it.
3736580	eng	I really don't remember it.
3736581	eng	They're looking for it.
3736582	eng	They're waiting for it.
3736583	eng	Tom wants Mary to know that if she ever needs help, all she has to do is ask him for it.
3736584	eng	Well, that explains it.
3736585	eng	Let's discuss it.
3736586	eng	Tom looked at it.
3736587	eng	Let Tom take a look at it.
3736588	eng	You should have a doctor take a look at it.
3736589	eng	Tom picked up the coin and took a closer look at it.
3736590	eng	I'll never forget it.
3736591	eng	I'm sure Tom will never forget it.
3736592	eng	Don't forget it.
3736593	eng	Well, you'll regret it.
3736594	eng	Tom won't want it.
3736595	eng	Tom couldn't prevent it.
3736596	eng	I haven't got it.
3736597	eng	I've kept it.
3736598	eng	It won't do any good to lie about it.
3736599	eng	Tom knows nothing about it.
3736600	eng	Tom pretended that he knew nothing about it.
3736601	eng	We're still talking about it.
3736602	eng	We don't want to talk about it.
3736603	eng	Don't talk about it.
3736604	eng	I thought about it.
3736605	eng	I was very happy about it.
3736606	eng	Tom never told Mary about it.
3736607	eng	I do worry about it.
3736608	eng	I forgot where I put it.
3736609	eng	I don't deserve this and you know it.
3736610	eng	It's impossible to fix it.
3736611	eng	I couldn't deny it.
3736612	eng	It's hard to catch fish without bait.
3736613	eng	Tom said he would wait.
3736614	eng	It's not worth the wait.
3736615	eng	I don't like it when you make me wait.
3736616	eng	Tom had to wait.
3736617	eng	You may have to wait.
3736618	eng	We didn't wait.
3736619	eng	Tom didn't wait.
3736620	eng	We can't do anything but wait.
3736621	eng	Tom fired his gun at the rabbit.
3736622	eng	Eat more fruit.
3736623	eng	I should've added more salt.
3736624	eng	Tom knew what I felt.
3736625	eng	I don't know how many years ago that bridge was built.
3736626	eng	That's your own fault.
3736627	eng	It's our own fault.
3736628	eng	It's all your own fault.
3736629	eng	This is your own fault.
3736630	eng	Perhaps it isn't your fault.
3736631	eng	This is no one's fault.
3736632	eng	That was perhaps Tom's fault.
3736633	eng	That wasn't Tom's fault.
3736634	eng	That was Tom's only fault.
3736635	eng	This could be my fault.
3736636	eng	It wasn't all my fault.
3736637	eng	That wasn't my fault.
3736638	eng	That really wasn't my fault.
3736639	eng	Tom did a somersault.
3736640	eng	Finishing the report by 2:30 shouldn't be too difficult.
3736641	eng	Finding Tom shouldn't be too difficult.
3736642	eng	They're too difficult.
3736643	eng	Of all the languages I've studied, French was the most difficult.
3736644	eng	It was extraordinarily difficult.
3736645	eng	The test was very difficult.
3736646	eng	That was what I meant.
3736647	eng	I'm not sure I understand what Tom meant.
3736648	eng	I see what Tom meant.
3736649	eng	That was what Tom meant.
3736650	eng	I never really understood what that meant.
3736651	eng	I think Tom didn't understand what you meant.
3736652	eng	Tom knew what Mary meant.
3736653	eng	Tom might be able to recommend a good restaurant.
3736654	eng	I have a feeling you'll like this restaurant.
3736655	eng	I knew you'd like that restaurant.
3736656	eng	This had better be important.
3736657	eng	This is more important.
3736658	eng	Tom says it's quite important.
3736659	eng	Tom wants to tell you something important.
3736660	eng	You wouldn't have come if you didn't think it was important.
3736661	eng	I don't think any of this is important.
3736662	eng	This test is important.
3736663	eng	I don't think this is all that important.
3736664	eng	Honesty is very important.
3736665	eng	I think you know what I want.
3736666	eng	Tom has just about everything a man could want.
3736667	eng	They're exactly what we want.
3736668	eng	Those are exactly what we want.
3736669	eng	That's exactly what we want.
3736670	eng	Tom might be able to get you what you want.
3736671	eng	Tom wanted Mary to tell John about the accident.
3736672	eng	Tom got killed in a freak accident.
3736673	eng	Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
3736674	eng	I'm also a student.
3736675	eng	Tom had never had time to read anything other than textbooks when he was a student.
3736676	eng	This should be sufficient.
3736677	eng	You're very disobedient.
3736678	eng	It's very convenient.
3736679	eng	I think you could've been more patient.
3736680	eng	I think you've been very patient.
3736681	eng	Tom seemed a little impatient.
3736682	eng	Tom has real talent.
3736683	eng	Let's be silent.
3736684	eng	The cabin was absolutely silent.
3736685	eng	It's excellent.
3736686	eng	It's dark in the basement.
3736687	eng	Just wait a moment.
3736688	eng	This is a very complicated piece of equipment.
3736689	eng	Tom never showed up for his appointment.
3736690	eng	Tom Jackson is the head of our department.
3736691	eng	Tom stared at the document.
3736692	eng	I wouldn't get involved in their argument.
3736693	eng	Tom agreed that he would pay half the rent.
3736694	eng	I had completely forgotten pay the rent.
3736695	eng	Don't forget to pay the rent.
3736696	eng	Tom had to borrow money from Mary to pay his rent.
3736697	eng	I still need to pay my rent.
3736698	eng	Well, that's different.
3736699	eng	Your hair is different.
3736700	eng	It doesn't look all that different.
3736701	eng	Tom wanted to know why Mary was absent.
3736702	eng	Tom was present.
3736703	eng	Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
3736704	eng	This is a good place to pitch our tent.
3736705	eng	This is a perfect place for us to pitch our tent.
3736706	eng	I don't know exactly where Tom went.
3736707	eng	Tom can't paint.
3736708	eng	I get your point.
3736709	eng	Tom's car is still parked out front.
3736710	eng	Tom didn't hunt.
3736711	eng	I think you ought to put more money into your savings account.
3736712	eng	Well, that's all I've got.
3736713	eng	The room's getting hot.
3736714	eng	It was stiflingly hot.
3736715	eng	It was a lucky shot.
3736716	eng	Tom is a complete idiot.
3736717	eng	Tom called the referee an idiot.
3736718	eng	Tom and Mary have helped me a lot.
3736719	eng	I'm enjoying myself a lot.
3736720	eng	Tom used to drink a lot.
3736721	eng	I really like Tom a lot.
3736722	eng	Well, that helps a lot.
3736723	eng	My knee hurts a lot.
3736724	eng	I've always admired you a lot.
3736725	eng	I've missed you a lot.
3736726	eng	Tom might be here by 2:30, but then, maybe not.
3736727	eng	I'm sick and tired of pretending that I'm something that I'm not.
3736728	eng	I ought to be scared, but I'm not.
3736729	eng	I don't even know if Tom has a girlfriend or not.
3736730	eng	Tom wasn't sure if he liked the painting or not.
3736731	eng	I don't know whether to believe Tom or not.
3736732	eng	Tom asked me whether I liked his plan or not.
3736733	eng	Tom asked me whether I liked Boston or not.
3736734	eng	Tom wasn't sure whether he should do that or not.
3736735	eng	Tom wasn't sure if he could do it or not.
3736736	eng	Sometimes it's a little hard to tell if Tom's happy or not.
3736737	eng	Tom asked me whether I liked Mary or not.
3736738	eng	Someone stepped on my foot.
3736739	eng	Tom was barefoot.
3736740	eng	There's a little tea left in the pot.
3736741	eng	There's not much tea left in the pot.
3736742	eng	This is the spot.
3736743	eng	Tom doesn't seem very smart.
3736744	eng	I've always thought you weren't very smart.
3736745	eng	Here's the best part.
3736746	eng	The two of them have grown apart.
3736747	eng	Tom and Mary have grown apart.
3736748	eng	Tom wants to know when we're going to start.
3736749	eng	You would've liked the concert.
3736750	eng	I knew you'd enjoy the concert.
3736751	eng	Tom thought that Mary would enjoy the concert.
3736752	eng	Tom has given me three tickets to his concert.
3736753	eng	Make an effort.
3736754	eng	Time is running short.
3736755	eng	I was surprised when Tom asked me to help him write the report.
3736756	eng	I didn't have time to write the report.
3736757	eng	We should give Tom a chance to finish the report.
3736758	eng	There's nothing new to report.
3736759	eng	I really appreciate your support.
3736760	eng	I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
3736761	eng	Tom tried to remember where he had put his passport.
3736762	eng	Tell Tom that he needs to make sure he doesn't forget to renew his passport.
3736763	eng	I guess I'm lucky I wasn't hurt.
3736764	eng	Tom might be badly hurt.
3736765	eng	I was too fast.
3736766	eng	Tom said that he takes a walk every morning before breakfast.
3736767	eng	We often watch TV while we're eating breakfast.
3736768	eng	Tom usually reads the newspapers while he's eating breakfast.
3736769	eng	I should've eaten breakfast.
3736770	eng	I often skip breakfast.
3736771	eng	I often don't have time to eat breakfast.
3736772	eng	Tom didn't want any breakfast.
3736773	eng	I'm willing to forget the past.
3736774	eng	Tom's plan seemed the best.
3736775	eng	Tom's plan seems the best.
3736776	eng	Choose the one you like best.
3736777	eng	Pick the one you like best.
3736778	eng	Tom has done his best.
3736779	eng	I've done my best.
3736780	eng	I was trying my best.
3736781	eng	Of all the languages I've studied, French was the hardest.
3736782	eng	Of all the languages I've studied, French was the easiest.
3736783	eng	Tell me the rest.
3736784	eng	I think we should let Tom get some rest.
3736785	eng	The doctor says you're going to need a lot of rest.
3736786	eng	I heard you passed the test.
3736787	eng	I thought Tom would pass the test.
3736788	eng	I think that most, if not all, of my students will pass the test.
3736789	eng	I knew you wouldn't pass the test.
3736790	eng	I hope I can pass the driving test.
3736791	eng	This isn't a fair test.
3736792	eng	I have a feeling you'll pass your test.
3736793	eng	You're my guest.
3736794	eng	Tom must've been the one who added Mary's name to the list.
3736795	eng	I have thirteen names on my list.
3736796	eng	You never told me you were such a good violinist.
3736797	eng	Tom is a fine violinist.
3736798	eng	You should have the doctor look at your wrist.
3736799	eng	I'm studying to be an artist.
3736800	eng	Tom never worried about how much things cost.
3736801	eng	Fortunately, no lives were lost.
3736802	eng	Don't get lost.
3736803	eng	Tom never would've left without telling me first.
3736804	eng	I shouldn't have used Tom's knife without asking him first.
3736805	eng	I should've asked for permission first.
3736806	eng	Tom seemed frightened at first.
3736807	eng	Tom was confused at first.
3736809	eng	This will quench your thirst.
3736810	eng	Tom is the only person I can really trust.
3736811	eng	I still need to get a haircut.
3736812	eng	This door has been welded shut.
3736813	eng	Tom kept his eyes shut.
3736814	eng	Have a donut.
3736815	eng	Tom walked to the door and looked out.
3736816	eng	Tom walked to the window and looked out.
3736817	eng	The concert was sold out.
3736818	eng	Tom'll find out.
3736819	eng	I'll go see what I can find out.
3736820	eng	Tell me what you find out.
3736821	eng	The fire has gone out.
3736822	eng	The lights were out.
3736823	eng	This shouldn't be hard for us to figure out.
3736824	eng	I'm trying to figure out how you managed to do that without anyone finding out.
3736825	eng	This isn't working out.
3736826	eng	Thanks for helping out.
3736827	eng	I don't like eating out.
3736828	eng	Tom enjoys eating out.
3736829	eng	You'd better look out.
3736830	eng	Everything will work out.
3736831	eng	Tom looks worn out.
3736832	eng	Tom was completely worn out.
3736833	eng	Eventually, my patience is going to run out.
3736834	eng	I've got to go out.
3736835	eng	The fire was out.
3736836	eng	I'm glad you're here to help us out.
3736837	eng	Tom couldn't figure it out.
3736838	eng	The candle suddenly went out.
3736839	eng	There was no way out.
3736840	eng	There's another way out.
3736841	eng	Tom opened the cage and let the monkey out.
3736842	eng	I don't know what Tom is so worried about.
3736843	eng	I know who you're talking about.
3736844	eng	I know exactly who you're talking about.
3736845	eng	I don't know the person you're talking about.
3736846	eng	I know who you're thinking about.
3736847	eng	That's all we talk about.
3736848	eng	You're all I can think about.
3736849	eng	That will give me something to think about.
3736850	eng	Please tell me what this is about.
3736851	eng	Tom is the person I told you about.
3736852	eng	There's something I need to talk to you about.
3736853	eng	I had a blackout.
3736854	eng	I know what's going to happen next.
3736855	eng	I've always admired you.
3736856	eng	We all missed you.
3736857	eng	Forget what I've just told you.
3736858	eng	I don't quite understand you.
3736859	eng	Come on, Tom, I'll race you.
3736860	eng	I suggest you don't let Tom see you.
3736861	eng	Tom will be really glad to see you.
3736862	eng	Tom will be really pleased to see you.
3736863	eng	It's so nice to see you.
3736864	eng	Tom will be really happy to see you.
3736865	eng	I like Tom a lot more than I like you.
3736866	eng	I can see why Tom doesn't like you.
3736867	eng	I used to be young and ambitious, just like you.
3736868	eng	I'd cut down those trees if I were you.
3736869	eng	Tell me why I shouldn't fire you.
3736870	eng	I just hope I didn't bore you.
3736871	eng	Come and let us surprise you.
3736872	eng	Tom can advise you.
3736873	eng	I wish that I could believe you.
3736874	eng	I didn't mean to deceive you.
3736875	eng	I've got nothing to give you.
3736876	eng	I'm still afraid of you.
3736877	eng	Well, I'm proud of you.
3736878	eng	That wasn't very nice of you.
3736879	eng	I've had enough of you.
3736880	eng	I'm jealous of you.
3736881	eng	I certainly don't mind helping you.
3736882	eng	They're just using you.
3736883	eng	Tom never stopped loving you.
3736884	eng	I'll teach you.
3736885	eng	It's a good thing you have your umbrella with you.
3736886	eng	I'll soon be with you.
3736887	eng	I thought Tom might be with you.
3736888	eng	I want to spend more time with you.
3736889	eng	I look forward to working with you.
3736890	eng	Tom says it's urgent that he speak with you.
3736891	eng	I want to walk with you.
3736892	eng	I know Tom isn't planning on going to Boston with you.
3736893	eng	I really want to go to Boston with you.
3736894	eng	I think we'll go with you.
3736895	eng	Tom might like to go with you.
3736896	eng	We all want to go with you.
3736897	eng	Tom might want to go with you.
3736898	eng	I'm interested in having dinner with you.
3736899	eng	Tom won't want to play tennis with you.
3736900	eng	Tom has a lot of questions to ask you.
3736901	eng	Pull as hard as you can when I tell you.
3736902	eng	I've already told you everything I'm going to tell you.
3736903	eng	We have some important news to tell you.
3736904	eng	I'm always happy when I get email from you.
3736905	eng	I didn't expect this from you.
3736906	eng	Tom loves me more than you.
3736907	eng	I like Tom a lot more than you.
3736908	eng	I'm richer than you.
3736909	eng	I've never loved any girl other than you.
3736910	eng	I've never forgotten you.
3736911	eng	I'm not interested in you.
3736912	eng	I need to know I can depend on you.
3736913	eng	Tom seemed to be picking on you.
3736914	eng	I didn't tell on you.
3736915	eng	That's a beautiful color on you.
3736916	eng	There's something I need to give to you.
3736917	eng	Tom wants to speak to you.
3736918	eng	The police are here to talk to you.
3736919	eng	It might happen to you.
3736920	eng	Allow me to demonstrate my invention to you.
3736921	eng	I know how important Tom is to you.
3736922	eng	Everybody listens to you.
3736923	eng	I know who gave that to you.
3736924	eng	I want to know who gave that to you.
3736925	eng	There's so much more I need to say to you.
3736926	eng	Nobody will help you.
3736927	eng	If you'll wait a moment, I can help you.
3736928	eng	Perhaps Tom can help you.
3736929	eng	I came back to help you.
3736930	eng	I've asked Tom to help you.
3736931	eng	Well, I can't help you.
3736932	eng	I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
3736933	eng	That's why I can't help you.
3736934	eng	Tom might help you.
3736935	eng	This may help you.
3736936	eng	I've got nothing to offer you.
3736937	eng	No one will bother you.
3736938	eng	I'll look after you.
3736939	eng	I'll get over you.
3736940	eng	Well, I waited for you.
3736941	eng	I thought you'd appreciate what Tom did for you.
3736942	eng	I'll send for you.
3736943	eng	Well, I'm here for you.
3736944	eng	Those pajamas are too big for you.
3736945	eng	I'll do anything for you.
3736946	eng	Everyone's looking for you.
3736947	eng	Everybody's looking for you.
3736948	eng	Everyone's asking for you.
3736949	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting for you.
3736950	eng	Everybody's waiting for you.
3736951	eng	There's a call for you.
3736952	eng	I still have one more question for you.
3736953	eng	There's not much I can do for you.
3736954	eng	We don't have enough room in the car for you.
3736955	eng	Here's a box of chocolates for you.
3736956	eng	If you like, I can do that for you.
3736957	eng	Tom might be willing to babysit for you.
3736958	eng	This is a Christmas present for you.
3736959	eng	I was ready for you.
3736960	eng	Not everyone is as considerate as you.
3736961	eng	Not everyone has as much money as you.
3736962	eng	Not everyone is as busy as you.
3736963	eng	Tom wasn't mad at you.
3736964	eng	It's very nice to meet you.
3736965	eng	Nobody will hurt you.
3736966	eng	If you ever hurt Tom, I'm going to hurt you.
3736967	eng	I've got nothing against you.
3736968	eng	Tom didn't tell me anything about you.
3736969	eng	Tom often talks about you.
3736970	rus	Эмилия учит датский, потому что этим летом она собирается вместе с родителями в Данию.
3736971	heb	טום לא סיפר לי דבר עליך.
3736972	eng	I couldn't live without you.
3736973	eng	I couldn't have done that without you.
3736974	eng	I shouldn't have done that without you.
3736975	eng	I don't want to do that without you.
3736976	eng	I can't repay you.
3736977	eng	I can't marry you.
3736978	eng	Tom doesn't get along with his father-in-law.
3736979	eng	Mary doesn't like her mother-in-law.
3736980	eng	I'm just telling you what I saw.
3736981	eng	I don't know what Tom saw.
3736982	eng	Tell us exactly what you saw.
3736983	eng	I thought that you already knew.
3736984	eng	Tom knew what Mary knew.
3736985	eng	Tom might not be the one who broke the window.
3736986	eng	Tom might possibly have been the one who broke the window.
3736987	eng	Watch from the window.
3736988	eng	I thought we could put a sign in the window.
3736989	eng	It looks like somebody was trying to pry open this window.
3736990	eng	Tom never opens that window.
3736991	eng	We'll do it somehow.
3736992	eng	These pills are hard to swallow.
3736993	eng	Tom took the pillowcase off the pillow.
3736994	eng	This neighborhood is completely safe now.
3736995	eng	Please don't leave me now.
3736996	eng	Tom is the only person who can help me now.
3736997	eng	Tom and Mary aren't here now.
3736998	eng	I'm going back there now.
3736999	eng	This is your house now.
3737000	eng	It won't do any good to apologize now.
3737001	eng	Everyone is watching now.
3737002	eng	We don't need to do anything now.
3737003	eng	Tom might be writing email now.
3737004	eng	I can pay part of my bill now.
3737005	eng	You're my girl now.
3737006	eng	You should be home with Tom now.
3737007	eng	It won't do any good to talk to Tom now.
3737008	eng	Things were better then than now.
3737009	eng	I'm a man now.
3737010	eng	I wish I could be in Boston now.
3737011	eng	It's probably best if we go now.
3737012	eng	You really have to go now.
3737013	eng	I ought to go now.
3737014	eng	I think you know who you need to talk to now.
3737015	eng	There's no danger now.
3737016	eng	You'll feel better now.
3737017	eng	That's over now.
3737018	eng	I'm done for now.
3737019	eng	Tom has been unemployed for three months now.
3737020	eng	I'm your boss now.
3737021	eng	Tom is the only one who can help us now.
3737022	eng	Well, it's obvious now.
3737023	eng	I'd prefer not to comment on that now.
3737024	eng	It's probably too late to worry about that now.
3737025	eng	I wish I had my camera with me right now.
3737026	eng	I have very little money on me right now.
3737027	eng	I really wish you'd do this for me right now.
3737028	eng	Tom really wants to go home right now.
3737029	eng	I'm on the phone right now.
3737030	eng	Tom and Mary aren't here right now.
3737031	eng	Tom might be studying right now.
3737032	eng	We're all right now.
3737033	eng	Tom's all right now.
3737034	eng	I'm supposed to be helping Tom right now.
3737035	eng	I don't think I need your help right now.
3737036	eng	We're eating dinner right now.
3737037	eng	We're having dinner right now.
3737038	eng	I wonder where Tom is right now.
3737039	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knows where Mary is right now.
3737040	eng	I don't think I want to do that right now.
3737041	eng	Tom might be playing chess with Mary right now.
3737042	eng	I'm very busy right now.
3737043	eng	Tell me about it now.
3737044	eng	We know it now.
3737045	eng	Everything is different now.
3737046	eng	I don't feel like going out now.
3737047	eng	I can't tell you now.
3737048	eng	There's not much I can do for you now.
3737049	eng	Tom is probably pretty rich by now.
3737050	eng	I thought you'd be ready by now.
3737051	eng	I'm hoping that Tom is with Mary now.
3737052	eng	Tom is writing a letter to Mary now.
3737053	eng	You'd better take it easy now.
3737054	eng	Tom is the only one here that I know.
3737055	eng	Well, just let me know.
3737056	eng	Tom might be dead for all we know.
3737057	eng	I need you to tell me everything I need to know.
3737058	eng	That's what I wanted to know.
3737059	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he wanted to know.
3737060	eng	Tom might've been able to tell us what we wanted to know.
3737061	eng	Tom might be able to tell us what we want to know.
3737062	eng	I'm not allowed to tell what you want to know.
3737063	eng	It's too early to know.
3737064	eng	Tom told me some things about Mary that I didn't know.
3737065	eng	They didn't know.
3737066	eng	Tom and Mary think I don't know.
3737067	eng	I'm not going to tell Tom anything that he doesn't already know.
3737068	eng	The whole place was covered in snow.
3737069	eng	Tom didn't hear the rooster crow.
3737070	eng	I thought Tom might have a hammer I could borrow.
3737071	eng	The swimming pool will be closed tomorrow.
3737072	eng	Tom will be coming to see me tomorrow.
3737073	eng	Tom wants to come here tomorrow.
3737074	eng	Tom wants to take everyone's picture tomorrow.
3737075	eng	I'm going tomorrow.
3737076	eng	Perhaps I could come back tomorrow.
3737077	eng	We'd better wait until tomorrow.
3737078	eng	I don't know what I'm going to do tomorrow.
3737079	eng	I wonder when I'll wake up tomorrow.
3737080	eng	I have no plans for tomorrow.
3737081	eng	My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish this tomorrow.
3737082	eng	Tom told me that he would like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
3737083	eng	Tom might be able to help us tomorrow.
3737084	eng	Tom told me that he would do it tomorrow.
3737085	eng	Tom might be able to help you tomorrow.
3737086	eng	It'll be ready tomorrow.
3737087	eng	I wonder what could be in the box.
3737088	eng	There were no more apples in the box.
3737089	eng	Tom tried to lift the box.
3737090	eng	Bring your tool box.
3737091	eng	Tom kicked the wooden box.
3737092	eng	I think there's something inside this box.
3737093	eng	Tomorrow is Father's Day.
3737094	eng	Tom practices the piano three hours a day.
3737095	eng	Try to have a good day.
3737096	eng	The picnic lasted the whole day.
3737097	eng	I think you've had enough candy for one day.
3737098	eng	This is my wedding day.
3737099	eng	The picnic lasted all day.
3737100	eng	I thought you were going to be gone all day.
3737101	eng	Is something the matter? You haven't said a thing all day.
3737102	eng	Tom listened to the radio all day.
3737103	eng	It was a wonderful day.
3737104	eng	Tom is the boy I told you about the other day.
3737105	eng	It's a hot day.
3737106	eng	I'm sick and tired of eating the same thing for lunch every day.
3737107	eng	Tom used to take a walk every day.
3737108	eng	Tom practices playing the violin at least thirty minutes every day.
3737109	eng	Tom is making Mary something for her birthday.

3737134	eng	I do feel pretty good today.
3737135	eng	You sure worked hard today.

3737141	eng	Tom thought that Mary would be here today.
3737142	eng	I wasn't expecting you to be here today.
3737143	eng	I thought you wouldn't be here today.
3737144	eng	It's a good thing Tom isn't here today.
3737145	eng	I wonder if Tom knows why Mary isn't here today.
3737146	eng	Tom might know why Mary isn't here today.
3737147	eng	Let's go there today.
3737148	eng	It'll be crowded everywhere today.
3737149	eng	I don't want to be late today.

3737151	eng	Tom asked me if I'd mind working late today.
3737152	eng	I don't think I need to do anything today.
3737153	eng	I don't want to go shopping today.
3737154	eng	I just don't want to go shopping today.
3737155	eng	I've done nothing interesting today.
3737157	eng	I thought you'd like to know that Tom was absent from school today.
3737158	eng	I thought you said you wouldn't be coming to school today.
3737159	eng	Tom asked me if I'd be willing to help him after school today.
3737160	eng	I know what happened at school today.
3737161	eng	My advice would be to avoid Tom today.
3737162	eng	It's unusually warm today.
3737163	eng	Tom is dressed exactly like John today.
3737164	eng	Tom slept in class again today.
3737165	eng	I'm pretty sure it's not going to rain today.
3737166	eng	Something is going on today.
3737167	eng	There's a lot work to do today.
3737168	eng	Apples are cheap today.
3737169	eng	It looks like we might have good weather today.
3737170	eng	I was thinking about Tom earlier today.
3737171	eng	It's much warmer today.
3737172	eng	I didn't have time to do that today.
3737173	eng	I don't have time to help you today.
3737174	eng	I've decided to go home early today.
3737175	eng	Tom might go home early today.
3737176	eng	I got up early today.
3737177	eng	Tom spoke to me for a while yesterday.
3737178	eng	Tom finally called me yesterday.
3737179	eng	I thought you were going to be here yesterday.
3737180	eng	Tom never told me why he wasn't here the day before yesterday.
3737181	eng	I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
3737182	eng	We saw them yesterday.
3737183	eng	I'm much better today than I was yesterday.
3737184	eng	I met one of my old teachers yesterday.
3737185	eng	I want to know why you weren't here to help us yesterday.
3737186	eng	Tom told me that yesterday.
3737187	eng	I should've paid my rent yesterday.
3737188	eng	I want to know why you were absent yesterday.
3737189	eng	I overslept yesterday.
3737190	eng	I didn't think it would snow yesterday.
3737191	eng	It snowed all day yesterday.
3737192	eng	Tom wants to know if he can come over and play.
3737193	eng	Tom didn't enjoy the play.
3737194	eng	Tom didn't pray.
3737195	eng	I wish I knew what I should say.
3737196	eng	Tom knew what Mary would say.
3737197	eng	Tom seemed interested in what we had to say.
3737198	eng	Tom told me he was not at all interested in what Mary had to say.
3737199	eng	Tom listened to what Mary had to say.
3737200	eng	Let me tell you what you need to say.
3737201	eng	I don't know what you expect me to say.
3737202	eng	I have more to say.
3737203	eng	I'm not interested in anything you have to say.
3737204	eng	I think I've finally understood what you were trying to say.
3737205	eng	Tom knew what Mary was trying to say.
3737206	eng	There's so much to say.
3737207	eng	Tom said he had something very important to say.
3737208	eng	I may not be able to speak French as well as Tom, but I can usually communicate what I want to say.
3737209	eng	That's easy to say.
3737210	eng	I've had my say.
3737211	eng	I thought that you already had a place to stay.
3737212	eng	I think I can't stay.
3737213	eng	Tom wanted Mary to understand why he couldn't stay.
3737214	eng	They won't stay.
3737215	eng	Everyone has their own way.
3737216	eng	You've got to do it this way.
3737217	eng	It was bound to happen that way.
3737218	eng	I didn't know your father had passed away.
3737219	eng	They've all moved away.
3737220	eng	Tom drove away.
3737221	eng	They're not going away.
3737222	eng	I didn't run away.
3737223	eng	Tom wanted Mary to go away.
3737224	eng	I'd better go away.
3737225	eng	Tom won't go away.
3737226	eng	I can't get away.
3737227	eng	Tom wants to see you in his office right away.
3737228	eng	We liked each other right away.
3737229	eng	They're going to do it right away.
3737230	eng	Tom wasn't at home when I dropped by.
3737231	eng	Tom wasn't in when I dropped by.
3737232	eng	Tom wasn't asleep when I dropped by.
3737233	eng	I didn't know you were coming by.
3737234	eng	Stop being such a baby.
3737235	eng	I have friends waiting for me in the lobby.
3737236	eng	Tom wants some privacy.
3737237	eng	You don't need to wear anything fancy.
3737238	eng	I thought you'd be ready.
3737239	eng	The team will be ready.
3737240	eng	I want to be ready.
3737241	eng	I'm not quite ready.
3737242	eng	I'm still getting ready.
3737243	eng	I think it's time for us to start getting ready.
3737244	eng	We're all ready.
3737245	eng	Tom told me he was ready.
3737246	eng	Everything was ready.
3737247	eng	Keep your weapons ready.
3737248	eng	I'm always ready.
3737249	eng	I'm going to go get ready.
3737250	eng	It's time for us to get ready.
3737251	eng	It's time we got ready.
3737252	eng	They're not ready.
3737253	eng	Tom's French is quite good already.
3737254	eng	Tom must've gone home already.
3737255	eng	You've done so much for us already.
3737256	eng	You've said that already.
3737257	eng	Tom must've known about it already.
3737258	eng	Tom might've written to Mary already.
3737259	eng	Tom keeps his room tidy.
3737260	eng	The room was very untidy.
3737261	eng	These may come in handy.
3737262	eng	This may come in handy.
3737263	eng	It was quite windy.
3737264	eng	I'm not engaged to anybody.
3737265	eng	Tom never says thanks to anybody.
3737266	eng	Tom wants to see everybody.
3737267	eng	I thought I'd give you a key.
3737268	eng	Tom's got the key.
3737269	eng	I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
3737270	eng	I have very little money.
3737271	eng	They may need some money.
3737272	eng	Tom might be willing to donate some money.
3737273	eng	I told Tom I'd be willing to loan him some money.
3737274	eng	I think we'll need more money.
3737275	eng	I think I'll need a little more money.
3737276	eng	Tom just wanted to earn a little more money.
3737277	eng	What I need is a little more money.
3737278	eng	I wish I had a lot more money.
3737279	eng	I can't borrow any more money.
3737280	eng	Tom found a whole bunch of money.
3737281	eng	I wish I had a lot of money.
3737282	eng	I know how we can make a lot of money.
3737283	eng	Tom promised me a lot of money.
3737284	eng	Tom owed me a lot of money.
3737285	eng	Tom had plenty of money.
3737286	eng	The company where Tom works is losing money.
3737287	eng	My parents didn't have much money.
3737288	eng	I shouldn't have spent so much money.
3737289	eng	Tom wasn't sure if he had enough money.
3737290	eng	I don't care what Tom does with his own money.
3737291	eng	All Tom needed was money.
3737292	eng	All that Tom needed was money.
3737293	eng	Everyone wants money.
3737294	eng	I wonder what Tom is going to do with all that money.
3737295	eng	I couldn't think of a good place to hide my money.
3737296	eng	Stop spending my money.
3737297	eng	Tom never gave me any money.
3737298	eng	I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom any money.
3737299	eng	Have a pleasant journey.
3737300	eng	It was very stuffy.
3737301	eng	Worrying is a waste of energy.
3737302	eng	Doing that is a waste of energy.
3737303	eng	Tom was very shy.
3737304	eng	Tom wanted sympathy.
3737305	eng	Everyone wants to be healthy.
3737306	eng	My parents weren't very wealthy.
3737307	eng	I want to know who did this and why.
3737308	eng	I can't understand why.
3737309	eng	I guess I'm lucky.
3737310	eng	I think you've been lucky.
3737311	eng	Tom wasn't so lucky.
3737312	eng	That was lucky.
3737313	eng	That was very lucky.
3737314	eng	Tom pointed at the sky.
3737315	eng	Tom failed miserably.
3737316	eng	Tom always seems so friendly.
3737317	eng	Tom wants to know how he can lose weight quickly and safely.
3737318	eng	Tom might be lonely.
3737319	eng	Tom looks lonely.
3737320	eng	Tom wants us to think he's not lonely.

3737324	eng	Take me home immediately.
3737325	eng	Leave the room immediately.
3737326	eng	I haven't been to Boston lately.
3737327	eng	I've been forgetting things lately.

3737329	eng	Tom might help us if we ask him politely.
3737330	eng	Tom might help you if you ask him politely.
3737331	eng	Tom never hurt a fly.
3737332	eng	You should be with friends and family.
3737333	eng	Tom told me he came from a large family.
3737334	eng	Tom grew up in a rich family.
3737335	eng	You've got a wonderful family.
3737336	eng	This house isn't big enough for our family.
3737337	eng	I think you should go to Boston to be with your family.
3737338	eng	It's from your family.
3737339	eng	Tell us about your family.

3737341	eng	Tom wants to spend more time with his family.
3737342	eng	The rumor spread quickly.
3737343	eng	The rumors spread quickly.
3737344	eng	I hope you recover quickly.
3737345	eng	Tom washed his hands quickly.
3737346	eng	I should've listened more carefully.
3737347	eng	I promised to read the report carefully.
3737348	eng	I promise to read the report carefully.

3737359	eng	Everybody looked around nervously.
3737360	eng	Tom will understand perfectly.
3737361	eng	I don't think I heard you correctly.
3737362	eng	I haven't eaten pizza recently.
3737363	eng	Tom was here recently.
3737364	eng	We underestimated the enemy.
3737365	eng	This is as good place to pitch our tent as any.
3737366	eng	I was surprised when Tom said he was applying for a job at our company.
3737367	eng	I was told you were the one who started this company.
3737368	eng	Tom will keep you company.
3737369	eng	This room smells funny.

3737493	eng	Tom knew Mary.
3737494	eng	I didn't even know Tom knew Mary.
3737495	eng	I thought Tom might know Mary.
3737496	eng	I've never kept a diary.
3737497	eng	Tom never allowed Mary to read his diary.
3737498	eng	Tom promised to meet Mary in front of the library.
3737499	eng	Tom wanted Mary to drive John to the library.
3737500	eng	Our bad luck was temporary.
3737501	eng	Tom wants to give Mary something special on their anniversary.
3737502	eng	It's almost our anniversary.
3737503	eng	You know this isn't necessary.
3737504	eng	Suddenly Tom began to cry.
3737505	eng	Tom didn't want to cry.
3737506	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
3737507	eng	I need a change of scenery.
3737508	eng	Life is a mystery.
3737509	eng	Tom is a mystery.
3737510	eng	Tom had to charge the battery.
3737511	eng	I thought you'd be angry.
3737512	eng	I think you've been trying to make me angry.
3737513	eng	I can tell that you're angry.
3737514	eng	I know why you're angry.
3737515	eng	Tom went away angry.
3737516	eng	Tom might be hungry.
3737517	eng	They said they're hungry.
3737518	eng	I didn't want anyone to go hungry.
3737519	eng	I'm beginning to get hungry.
3737520	eng	I'm feeling a bit hungry.
3737521	eng	I was a bit hungry.
3737522	eng	Tom wasn't a bit hungry.
3737523	eng	Tom wasn't really hungry.
3737524	eng	Tom doesn't seem very hungry.
3737525	eng	Tom told me a story.
3737527	eng	It's a fantastic story.
3737528	eng	That's a really nice story.
3737529	eng	Tell me the rest of the story.
3737530	eng	That's an interesting story.
3737531	eng	Tom wants people to believe his story.
3737532	eng	I think you're the kind of girl I'd like to marry.
3737533	eng	Tom seemed to be in a hurry.
3737534	eng	Tom seemed to be in no hurry.
3737535	eng	There was no hurry.
3737536	eng	I think you know that we need to hurry.
3737537	eng	Well, you'd better hurry.
3737538	eng	I'd say that's worth a try.
3737539	eng	Well, it's worth a try.
3737540	eng	Tom was willing to give it a try.
3737541	eng	That was a very good try.
3737542	eng	We'll let Tom try.
3737543	eng	I thought I'd give it another try.
3737544	eng	It's people like you who are ruining our country.
3737545	eng	The rest will be easy.
3737546	eng	It was too easy.
3737547	eng	It was all so easy.
3737548	eng	Life is never easy.
3737549	eng	Sometimes it's easy.
3737550	eng	This work isn't easy.
3737551	eng	You don't make it easy.
3737552	eng	I think you might need to take it easy.
3737553	eng	I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
3737554	eng	I thought you wouldn't be busy.
3737555	eng	Tom won't be busy.
3737556	eng	It doesn't look like you're busy.
3737557	eng	They said they're busy.
3737558	eng	Not all of them are busy.
3737559	eng	Tom thought you were busy.
3737560	eng	They're not all busy.
3737561	eng	I know you've been busy.
3737562	eng	Tom wants to help, but he says he's too busy.
3737563	eng	Tom never used to be so busy.
3737564	eng	I thought you wouldn't be so busy.
3737565	eng	Tom told me he was busy.
3737566	eng	Tom ought to have known that Mary was busy.
3737567	eng	I'm not usually this busy.
3737568	eng	Tom wasn't really busy.
3737569	eng	Tom doesn't seem very busy.
3737570	eng	I feel a little drowsy.
3737572	eng	Tom had business in the city.
3737573	eng	Let's drive into the city.
3737574	eng	It's an awfully big responsibility.
3737575	eng	It's a wonderful opportunity.
3737576	eng	It was my opportunity.
3737577	eng	This soup is too salty.
3737578	eng	As Tom said, this soup is too salty.
3737579	eng	There's only one difficulty.
3737580	eng	My rifle's empty.
3737581	eng	The barn was empty.
3737582	eng	Tom's glass was empty.
3737583	eng	The box was empty.
3737584	eng	The classroom is empty.
3737585	eng	I think the box is empty.
3737586	eng	The box wasn't empty.
3737587	eng	The box isn't empty.
3737588	eng	The place was completely empty.
3737589	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't want to have a party.
3737590	eng	I attended the party.
3737591	eng	Tom wasn't able to attend the party.
3737592	eng	I think we should let Tom go to the party.
3737593	eng	I still need to buy food for the party.
3737594	eng	I still need to buy stuff for the party.
3737595	eng	I'm very busy getting ready for the party.
3737596	eng	Tom seemed to know a lot of people at the party.
3737597	eng	There were a lot of girls at the party.
3737598	eng	Tom was the only one who wasn't at the party.
3737599	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who wasn't at the party.
3737600	eng	Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
3737601	eng	Tom never had the chance to talk to Mary at the party.
3737602	eng	Life is one big party.
3737603	eng	I hope you can make it to our party.
3737604	eng	I don't think we were invited to Tom's party.
3737605	eng	I'm not going to let you go to Tom's party.
3737606	eng	A lot of people were at Tom's party.
3737607	eng	I think you'll have fun at Tom's party.
3737608	eng	Tom thought that Mary would be at John's party.
3737609	eng	Tom might not go to tonight's party.
3737610	eng	I've decided to let Tom go to Mary's party.
3737611	eng	Tom ought to be allowed to go to Mary's party.
3737612	eng	I thought it was strange that Tom wasn't at Mary's party.
3737613	eng	Tom knows why nobody came to his party.
3737614	eng	Tom might not like it if we didn't come to his party.
3737615	eng	I promised Tom that we'd be at his party.
3737616	eng	Tom wanted Mary to be at his party.
3737617	eng	It's a great party.
3737618	eng	I don't want you at my party.
3737619	eng	Everything was dirty.
3737620	eng	Everything looks dirty.
3737621	eng	I thank you for your honesty.
3737622	eng	I was impressed by Tom's honesty.
3737623	eng	I thought you'd be thirsty.
3737624	eng	Tom might be thirsty.
3737625	eng	I thought you might be thirsty.
3737626	eng	They said they're thirsty.
3737627	eng	I wasn't thirsty.
3737628	eng	I really am very thirsty.
3737629	eng	Your room looks pretty.
3737630	eng	Mary is extraordinarily pretty.
3737631	eng	It's Tom's duty.
3737632	eng	This was a really good buy.
3737633	eng	Tom seemed like a nice guy.
3737634	eng	Tom is my kind of guy.
3737635	eng	They've all gone crazy.
3737636	eng	Sometimes I feel dizzy.
3737637	eng	I'm still dizzy.
3737638	eng	The only dance Tom can do is the waltz.
3737639	eng	Tom used to like jazz.
3737640	eng	We're moving to Boston next week.
3737641	eng	Will you be finished by 2:30?
3737642	eng	Can you reach high C?
3737643	eng	I've offended you, haven't I?
3737644	eng	Wait here a second, OK?
3737645	eng	We're doing everything we can, OK?
3737646	eng	Don't do that again, OK?
3737647	eng	Why would somebody think that was a good idea?
3737648	eng	Why would anybody think that was a good idea?
3737649	eng	How did you get that idea?
3737650	eng	Should I make some tea?
3737651	eng	Would it be OK if I borrowed your umbrella?
3737652	eng	Did Tom let you borrow his umbrella?
3737653	eng	So what's your dilemma?

3754633	eng	Little Kay is really with the Snow Queen, but he finds everything there so much to his taste and his liking, that he believes it is the finest place in the world; but this is because he has a piece of broken glass in his heart, and a little piece of glass in his eye. These must be taken out, or he will never be a human being again, and the Snow Queen will retain her power over him.

3754642	eng	In the midst of its empty, endless hall of snow was a frozen lake, broken on its surface into a thousand forms; each piece resembled another, from being in itself perfect as a work of art, and in the centre of this lake sat the Snow Queen, when she was at home.
3754643	eng	Just at this moment it happened that little Gerda came through the great door of the castle.
3754644	eng	She threw her arms round his neck, and held him fast, while she exclaimed, "Kay, dear little Kay, I have found you at last."
3754645	eng	Then little Gerda wept hot tears, which fell on his breast, and penetrated into his heart, and thawed the lump of ice, and washed away the little piece of glass which had stuck there.
3754646	eng	Gerda, dear little Gerda, where have you been all this time, and where have I been?
3754647	eng	Then Gerda kissed his cheeks, and they became blooming; and she kissed his eyes, and they shone like her own; she kissed his hands and his feet, and then he became quite healthy and cheerful.

3754650	eng	Both the reindeer ran by their side, and followed them as far as the boundaries of the country, where the first green leaves were budding.
3754651	eng	Then the birds began to twitter, and the forest too was full of green young leaves; and out of it came a beautiful horse.
3754652	eng	A young girl was riding upon the horse, with a shining red cap on her head, and pistols in her belt.

3754654	eng	Stop crying!
3754655	eng	They went upstairs into the little room, where all looked just as it used to do. The old clock was going "tick, tick," and the hands pointed to the time of day, but as they passed through the door into the room they perceived that they were both grown up, and become a man and woman.
3754656	eng	The roses out on the roof were in full bloom, and peeped in at the window; and there stood the little chairs, on which they had sat when children; and Kay and Gerda seated themselves each on their own chair, and held each other by the hand, while the cold empty grandeur of the Snow Queen's palace vanished from their memories like a painful dream.
3754657	eng	It was beautiful in the country, it was summer-time; the wheat was yellow, the oats were green, the hay was stacked up in the green meadow.
3754658	eng	In a sunny spot stood a pleasant old farm-house close by a deep river, and from the house down to the water side grew great burdock leaves, so high, that under the tallest of them a little child could stand upright. The spot was as wild as the centre of a thick wood. In this snug retreat sat a duck on her nest, watching for her young brood to hatch; she was beginning to get tired of her task, for the little ones were a long time coming out of their shells, and she seldom had any visitors.

Carry it always about with thee in thy pocket and never show it to anyone. When evil threatens thee or sorrow befalls thee, go into a corner, take it from thy pocket and give it something to eat and drink.

3764029	eng	I've told him before that the best solution for him is to seek out actual friends who will console him when he needs emotional support, instead of broadcasting on Fig Hunter, for reasons everyone should know by now. He already has his introvert site! Why should he feel the need to keep talking about his feelings on Fig Hunter when he already knows what will come of it? I understand that he considers Fig Hunter his "home", and the members therein his "guests". However, Pseudo didn't conduct himself as the most gracious host, either. He argued with people and openly called them names. Whether or not he is justified in doing so is irrelevant. What matters is that he doesn't have the time to be doing things like this. Talking back at these people is a complete waste of his time, when he could and should be working on his games or art or studying for university.

Of course I get upset about it. I like green! Their cyan-and-lower ratings not only bring down my average, but also look ugly on my green-themed posts. Basically, it rustles my jimmies by more than a little bit. Before, as some of you know, I might have started to complain about I don't want my comments to get rated when it's something trivial. Yet I choose not to reply because I know that what I have to say will likely be met with hostility, based on my experience with Fig Hunters.

И если мне не давали зелёных кружочков, к примеру, за короткие комментарии, оценивания которых я и не хотел, я решил не поднимать бучу не потому, что я хочу показать, что я эмоционально устойчив, крепок или что-то в этом духе. Конечно, меня это раздражает. Мне нравится зелёный! Эти голубые, а то и ниже, оценки не только уменьшают моё среднее число, но и не в тему к моим постам зелёного цвета. В общем, это меня явно задевает. Раньше, как помнят некоторые, я начал бы жаловаться, что я не хочу, чтобы мои комментарии оценивали, если это что-то банальное. Но сейчас я решаю не отвечать, потому что по опыту знаю, что сказанное мной будет, вероятно, воспринято другими в штыки.
