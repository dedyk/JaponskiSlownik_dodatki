3618800	eng	I don't have time to do all the things that need to be done.
3618801	eng	I'm the only one who knows what needs to be done.
3618802	eng	I'm going to find out what needs to be done.
3618803	eng	I think I know what needs to be done.
3618804	eng	Tom has done what everyone said couldn't be done.
3618805	eng	I don't know what else I could've done.
3618806	eng	Make sure Tom gets his homework done.
3618807	eng	I still don't have my homework done.
3618808	eng	It's a little easier said than done.
3618809	eng	I'll try to speak to Tom after everyone has gone home.
3618810	eng	Try to get Tom on the phone.
3618811	eng	I don't like the idea of you staying here alone.
3618812	eng	I don't like being all alone.
3618813	eng	I'm going to tell you something I've never ever told anyone.
3618814	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't want to offend anyone.
3618815	eng	I promised not to tell anyone.
3618816	eng	Tom is friendly with everyone.
3618817	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me who gave him that envelope.
3618818	eng	I think I now know where we are.
3618819	eng	I don't need to be told who you are.
3618820	eng	I'm sure Tom is just as scared as you are.
3618821	eng	I'm sure Tom is just as tired as you are.
3618822	eng	Tom is doing a wonderful job here.
3618823	eng	Tom knows everything that goes on around here.
3618824	eng	I'm sure Tom will be here.
3618825	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to be here.
3618826	eng	I'm here because I have to be here.
3618827	eng	I can't understand why Tom wouldn't want you to be here.
3618828	eng	I don't have a choice here.
3618829	eng	Maybe we shouldn't have come here.
3618830	eng	I don't know how many times we'll need to come here.
3618831	eng	I'm starting to understand why you didn't want to come here.
3618832	eng	I don't want Tom to know we're here.
3618833	eng	I think I know why you're here.
3618834	eng	I'm not supposed to leave here.
3618835	eng	I think you should get out of here.
3618836	eng	I need to get you out of here.
3618837	eng	I think I know a way out of here.
3618838	eng	I think I'm going to enjoy being here.
3618839	eng	I'm probably going to enjoy being here.
3618840	eng	It looks like Tom is going to start working here.
3618841	eng	I'm going to have to ask you to stop coming here.
3618842	eng	Please explain what's happening here.
3618843	eng	I think I'm going to like living here.
3618844	eng	I think I could get used to living here.
3618845	eng	I don't even know why I'm here.
3618846	eng	I don't know how to get home from here.
3618847	eng	It's a little crowded in here.
3618848	eng	It's a bit crowded in here.
3618849	eng	It's a mess in here.
3618850	eng	It's a real mess in here.
3618851	eng	It's a little creepy in here.
3618852	eng	I'm glad I'm not the youngest person here.
3618853	eng	I know why you came down here.
3618854	eng	I've got a job to do here.
3618855	eng	I've got work to do here.
3618856	eng	I don't think you're fit to be a teacher here.
3618857	eng	I'll go see if Tom is here.
3618858	eng	I don't think we should be talking about this here.
3618859	eng	Tom is going to wait until Mary gets here.
3618860	eng	Tom seems to be the only one who isn't here.
3618861	eng	I've been waiting for Tom to get here.
3618862	eng	I'll be finished by the time you get here.
3618863	eng	It's a little spooky out here.
3618864	eng	I'm not usually here.
3618865	eng	Tom isn't really happy here.
3618866	eng	I'm not sure when I should be there.
3618867	eng	I don't know when I need to be there.
3618868	eng	I'm not sure Tom is going to be there.
3618869	eng	Come on, Tom, you've got to get out of there.
3618870	eng	Tom may have been at the party last night, but I didn't see him there.
3618871	eng	I have a right to be in there.
3618872	eng	It's a mess down there.
3618873	eng	Make sure Tom doesn't leave before I get there.
3618874	eng	I don't see anything out there.
3618875	eng	Tom's mind is obviously elsewhere.
3618876	eng	I don't know how many people there were.
3618877	eng	Tom never told me how beautiful you were.
3618878	eng	Tom never told me how successful you were.
3618879	eng	Tom died in a fire.
3618880	eng	I don't know who started the fire.
3618881	eng	I've never spoken in public before.
3618882	eng	I don't think I've ever been here before.
3618883	eng	Tom has probably been here before.
3618884	eng	I don't think I've ever seen you this drunk before.
3618885	eng	I'm not the same person I was before.
3618886	eng	Tom has probably done this before.
3618887	eng	I don't remember ever meeting you before.
3618888	eng	I don't know why we didn't try it this way before.
3618889	eng	I'm going to explain it once more.
3618890	eng	Tom should've eaten more.
3618891	eng	I don't want to hear any more.
3618892	eng	I don't know why you even bother to come here anymore.
3618893	eng	I'm not going to study French anymore.
3618894	eng	Tom is barely able to walk anymore.
3618895	eng	I don't think you can ignore this problem anymore.
3618896	eng	My last name isn't Jackson anymore.
3618897	eng	Tom has decided not to live in Boston anymore.
3618898	eng	Tom can't fit into his old clothes anymore.
3618899	eng	I have no interest in doing this anymore.
3618900	eng	I don't know if I can do this anymore.
3618901	eng	I'm not so sure I want to do this anymore.
3618902	eng	I don't want you to do that anymore.
3618903	eng	I promised myself I wouldn't do that anymore.
3618904	eng	I recommend that you don't do that anymore.
3618905	eng	I don't like this game and I don't want to play it anymore.
3618906	eng	We don't want Tom to see you anymore.
3618907	eng	I'm not going to be working with you anymore.
3618908	eng	I'm not going to fight with you anymore.
3618909	eng	I don't think you're going to need me to help you anymore.
3618910	eng	I won't be able to visit you anymore.
3618911	eng	Tom has decided not to see Mary anymore.
3618912	eng	I have to fill in for Tom at the store.
3618913	eng	I think I know who painted that picture.
3618914	eng	I paid a lot of money for these.
3618915	eng	I'm sorry for breaking my promise.
3618916	eng	I hope we can reach some kind of compromise.
3618917	eng	I'm sure we can reach some kind of compromise.
3618918	eng	I think we can reach some kind of compromise.
3618919	eng	Tom was careful not to make too much noise.
3618920	eng	Tom got up early to see the sunrise.
3618921	eng	I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
3618922	eng	I'd rather eat somewhere else.
3618923	eng	I'd rather eat something else.
3618924	eng	I'm going to tell you something I've never told anybody else.
3618925	eng	Tom asked me if he could see my driver's license.
3618926	eng	I think you'll lose.
3618927	eng	I'm afraid I have to refuse.
3618928	eng	I have to clean the house.
3618929	eng	Tom has agreed to help us paint our house.
3618930	eng	Tom tried to sell his house.
3618931	eng	We've decided not to buy that house.
3618932	eng	Tom is going to meet me back at my house.
3618933	eng	Tom promised he'd help me build a doghouse.
3618934	eng	Tom promised to help me build a doghouse.
3618935	eng	Tom couldn't find his birth certificate.
3618936	eng	Tom called Mary to say he'd be late.
3618937	eng	I'm probably going to be a little late.
3618938	eng	Tom said he didn't want to work late.
3618939	eng	Tom told us the reason why he was late.
3618940	eng	Tom looked down at his plate.
3618941	eng	It's a little early to celebrate.
3618942	eng	I think it's a little too early to celebrate.
3618943	eng	I've already read some of what you wrote.
3618944	eng	Tom is going to be ready in just a minute.
3618945	eng	It's a commonly-used technique.
3618946	eng	I don't want you to say anything that isn't true.
3618947	eng	Tom looks like he'd like to leave.
3618948	eng	Tom asked me to leave.
3618949	eng	I assume you don't want me to leave.
3618950	eng	I've been waiting for Tom to leave.
3618951	eng	Tom looks like he wants to leave.
3618952	eng	I think you ought to leave.
3618953	eng	I really want to leave.
3618954	eng	Tom got home just as we were about to leave.
3618955	eng	I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.
3618956	eng	I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
3618957	eng	I don't know why you just don't leave.
3618958	eng	I think I should just leave.
3618959	eng	I think you should just leave.
3618960	eng	I'll come back after you leave.
3618961	eng	Tom has done a lot more for me than you have.
3618962	eng	I'll never forget that as long as I live.
3618963	eng	Tom helped me find a place to live.
3618964	eng	I don't think Tom has very long to live.
3618965	eng	Tom wanted Mary to drive.
3618966	eng	Tom's technique is impressive.
3618967	eng	You've lost perspective.
3618968	eng	I have a problem I think you can help me solve.
3618969	eng	I don't think I've ever been this close to falling in love.
3618970	eng	I've never actually been in love.
3618971	eng	I know what it's like to lose someone you love.
3618972	eng	Tom left the house without saying goodbye.
3618973	eng	I just wanted to come say goodbye.
3618974	eng	I've got to say goodbye.
3618975	eng	I'm sure Tom will apologize.
3618976	eng	I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
3618977	eng	I'm not going there to socialize.
3618978	eng	I'm going to be the new sheriff.
3618979	eng	Tom got in his car and drove off.
3618980	eng	Tom is the only one here who's tall enough to reach the top shelf.
3618981	eng	Tom looks pretty proud of himself.
3618982	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to be enjoying himself.
3618983	eng	Tom isn't really enjoying himself.
3618984	eng	Tom looks very pleased with himself.
3618985	eng	I don't think we should leave Tom here by himself.
3618986	eng	I don't think that we should leave Tom here by himself.
3618987	eng	There's no way Tom could've done this by himself.
3618988	eng	I don't like the idea of leaving you at home by yourself.
3618989	eng	I don't think it's a good idea for you to go Boston by yourself.
3618990	eng	I don't think you did this by yourself.
3618991	eng	I'm enjoying myself.
3618992	eng	I don't like to talk about myself.
3618993	eng	I think Tom used to play golf.
3618994	eng	I'm not the one you should be scared of.
3618995	eng	I'm not the one you should be afraid of.
3618996	eng	I don't know what I've been so afraid of.
3618997	eng	I have some unfinished business to take care of.
3618998	eng	Tom looked down at his broken leg.
3618999	eng	I thought you knew I was kidding.
3619000	eng	I thought you knew I was just kidding.
3619001	eng	Tom is pretty good at singing.
3619002	eng	I decided to do the same thing.
3619003	eng	I've decided to do the same thing.
3619004	eng	I'm really not good at that kind of thing.
3619005	eng	I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.
3619006	eng	I'm pretty sure I did the right thing.
3619007	eng	I know I'm doing the right thing.
3619008	eng	I'm trying very hard to do that right thing.
3619009	eng	Tom seems to be having trouble breathing.
3619010	eng	I'm having trouble breathing.
3619011	eng	Tom is having trouble breathing.
3619012	eng	Tom is never afraid of anything.
3619013	eng	I'm just too tired now to do anything.
3619014	eng	I don't understand how you can just sit there and not do anything.
3619015	eng	I don't know anything, so I can't tell you anything.
3619016	eng	Tom looked at Mary, but didn't say anything.
3619017	eng	I don't know how we're going to pay for everything.
3619018	eng	Tom's dying wish was that his son should inherit everything.
3619019	eng	Tom's family lost everything.
3619020	eng	Tom seems to be having trouble talking.
3619021	eng	Tom seems to be having trouble walking.
3619022	eng	Tom lost a lot of money gambling.
3619023	eng	Tom is tall enough to touch the ceiling.
3619024	eng	Tom is pretty good at computer programming.
3619025	eng	I'd really rather go swimming.
3619026	eng	I don't like to see this kind of thing happening.
3619027	eng	Tom looks tired this evening.
3619028	eng	I'm having dinner with Tom this evening.
3619029	eng	I'm not the only one who saw Tom swimming yesterday evening.
3619030	eng	Tom is usually a little irritable in the morning.
3619031	eng	I don't like getting up so early in the morning.
3619032	eng	Tom has been up since 6:30 this morning.
3619033	eng	Tom is coming to see me tomorrow morning.
3619034	eng	Tom is going to leave tomorrow morning.
3619035	eng	I have to leave first thing tomorrow morning.
3619036	eng	I'm going to need a ride to work tomorrow morning.
3619037	eng	I have no idea what I should be doing.
3619038	eng	I just wanted to check to see how you're doing.
3619039	eng	I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing.
3619040	eng	I just wanted to see how you were doing.
3619041	eng	We came by to see how Tom was doing.
3619042	eng	Tom was curious about what Mary was doing.
3619043	eng	Tom has been charged with kidnapping.
3619044	eng	Tom is getting ready to sing.
3619045	eng	I think Tom would've noticed if anything were missing.
3619046	eng	I must be hallucinating.
3619047	eng	I feel like celebrating.
3619048	eng	Tom has been telling everyone that he doesn't plan to attend the meeting.
3619049	eng	Tom was absent from the meeting.
3619050	eng	Tom has decided not to go to the meeting.
3619051	eng	I promise I'll be back in time for the meeting.
3619052	eng	Tom is going to try to attend this afternoon's meeting.
3619053	eng	I'm not going to be at this afternoon's meeting.
3619054	eng	I don't think we really need to attend that meeting.
3619055	eng	I'm glad to see you two have finally quit fighting.
3619056	eng	The concert was a bit disappointing.
3619057	eng	Tom sometimes doesn't seem to understand what I'm saying.
3619058	eng	It's a little annoying.
3619059	eng	Tom looks like he's been crying.
3619060	eng	Maybe we shouldn't have stayed so long.
3619061	eng	Tom's hair is long.
3619062	eng	I'm glad to see the two of you are getting along.
3619063	eng	I don't think Tom is going to admit that he's wrong.
3619064	eng	I'm trying to figure out what's wrong.
3619065	eng	Tom has agreed to help us figure out what's wrong.
3619066	eng	I don't believe I was wrong.
3619067	eng	I was right and Tom was wrong.
3619068	eng	Tom isn't the only one who thinks that is wrong.
3619069	eng	I just wanted to make sure I wasn't wrong.
3619070	eng	I don't think I know all the lyrics to this song.
3619071	eng	Tom never goes anywhere without his dog.
3619072	eng	Tom is eating a sandwich.
3619073	eng	Tom might know a little French.
3619074	eng	I've decided to start studying French.
3619075	eng	I need to find someone who can speak French.
3619076	eng	I'm fairly certain Tom doesn't know how to speak French.
3619077	eng	Tom may not know French.
3619078	eng	I'm not so sure I want to study French.
3619079	eng	I've decided not to study French.
3619080	eng	It's still a little early to eat lunch.
3619081	eng	The police have called off the search.
3619082	eng	Tom was dancing by himself on the back porch.
3619083	eng	It's a perfect match.
3619084	eng	I think I know who stole your watch.
3619085	eng	It's a minor glitch.
3619086	eng	Tom doesn't really like Italian food so much.
3619087	eng	I think you should stop complaining so much.
3619088	eng	Tom isn't really helping us much.
3619089	eng	I don't think I can help you very much.
3619090	eng	Tom admitted he didn't like Mary very much.
3619091	eng	Tom looked under the couch.
3619092	eng	Tom didn't try hard enough.
3619093	eng	Tom handed Mary an envelope full of cash.
3619094	eng	I have a feeling you're going to get your wish.
3619095	eng	Tom and Mary are going to get married on October 20th.
3619096	eng	I'm scared to death.
3619097	eng	Tom has always been a very easy person to get along with.
3619098	eng	Tom can be a little difficult to get along with.
3619099	eng	Tom can be a little difficult to work with.
3619100	eng	Tom is always broke by the end of the month.
3619101	eng	Tom's passport will expire next month.
3619102	eng	Tom is planning to go to Boston next month.
3619103	eng	It's a habit you can break.
3619104	eng	It's a hard habit to break.
3619105	eng	It's a pretty hard habit to break.
3619106	eng	I thought you got your job back.
3619107	eng	I think you ought to stand back.
3619108	eng	Tom's hands are tied behind his back.
3619109	eng	Tom has a tattoo of a snake on his back.
3619110	eng	We all need to leave before Tom gets back.
3619111	eng	I'm going to call you right back.
3619112	eng	I'd do anything to get you back.
3619113	eng	I don't think Tom is ever going to pay you back.
3619114	eng	Tom admitted he wasn't really sick.
3619115	eng	This key doesn't work in this lock.
3619116	eng	I need to find someone who can drive a truck.
3619117	eng	I've never driven a truck.
3619118	eng	Tom has probably never driven a truck.
3619119	eng	There are a lot of things I need to do this week.
3619120	eng	I'm not allowed to have visitors this week.
3619121	eng	Tom is probably going to have to go to Boston next week.
3619122	eng	Tom looked down at the sidewalk.
3619123	eng	Tom drinks a lot of milk.
3619124	eng	I'm just going to sit here for a while and think.
3619125	eng	I'm older than you think.
3619126	eng	I think it's time for a drink.
3619127	eng	It's a little too early for a drink.
3619128	eng	Tom has had a lot to drink.
3619129	eng	Let's go get drunk.
3619130	eng	Tom is extremely drunk.
3619131	eng	I walked home through the park.
3619132	eng	I don't mind hard work.
3619133	eng	I don't mind a bit of hard work.
3619134	eng	Tom doesn't always wear a tie to work.
3619135	eng	I don't know if it's going to work.
3619136	eng	I've always loved your work.
3619137	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom has finished his homework.
3619138	eng	I've got to make sure Tom does his homework.
3619139	eng	Tom is having trouble with his schoolwork.
3619141	eng	Tom left an envelope on your desk.
3619142	eng	Tom left something on your desk.
3619143	eng	There's a photo of Tom on Mary's desk.
3619144	eng	It isn't worth the risk.
3619145	eng	I think it's not worth the risk.
3619146	eng	I don't think this is real.
3619147	eng	Tom's blood pressure is normal.
3619148	eng	It's a little personal.
3619149	eng	Tom is going to have to go to a hospital.
3619150	eng	Tom came to visit me when I was in the hospital.
3619151	eng	Tom's parents never visited him when he was in the hospital.
3619152	eng	Tom doesn't want to go to the hospital.
3619153	eng	Tom is dressed a little more casually than usual.
3619154	eng	I'm not going to go to a hotel.
3619155	eng	Tom came to visit me when I was in jail.
3619156	eng	Tom has been put in jail.
3619157	eng	I remember every detail.
3619158	eng	Tom doesn't want to do anything at all.
3619159	eng	I don't think Tom needs much help at all.
3619160	eng	I don't think that's what Tom meant at all.
3619161	eng	It looks like Tom isn't interested in baseball.
3619162	eng	I've been expecting your call.
3619163	eng	Tom looked at the map on the wall.
3619164	eng	I thought I heard the doorbell.
3619165	eng	It's a bad time to sell.
3619166	eng	Tom went to work today even though he wasn't feeling well.
3619167	eng	Tom looked surprised, as well.
3619168	eng	It's very obvious that Tom doesn't understand French very well.
3619169	eng	Tom's hands are full.
3619170	eng	It's a really good school.
3619171	eng	I'm dropping out of school.
3619172	eng	Tom has decided not to drop out of school.
3619173	eng	Tom asked Mary where she had gone to junior high school.
3619174	eng	I've got to go or I'll be late for school.
3619175	eng	I'm going to go to law school.
3619176	eng	I have this under control.
3619177	eng	Tom noticed Mary wasn't being careful.
3619178	eng	Tom is going to get himself killed if he's not careful.
3619179	eng	I have to let Tom know where I am.
3619180	eng	I'm older than you think I am.
3619181	eng	I'm not the kind of person you think I am.
3619182	eng	Tom is better than any other player on the team.
3619183	eng	Tom is on both the swim team and the track team.
3619184	eng	Tom washed the dishes and Mary dried them.
3619185	eng	I won't be going with them.
3619186	eng	I fear we may have a problem.
3619187	eng	Tom wasn't able to solve the problem.
3619188	eng	I don't know how to deal with the problem.
3619189	eng	Tom wanted Mary to say that she loved him.
3619190	eng	Tom told Mary that his mother never loved him.
3619191	eng	Tom slammed the door shut behind him.
3619192	eng	Tom was almost dead when we found him.
3619193	eng	Tom noticed Mary coming toward him.
3619194	eng	Tom wanted me to ask Mary if she liked him.
3619195	eng	I think you should tell Tom that you love him.
3619196	eng	Tom didn't realize what was expected of him.
3619197	eng	Tom looked down at the plate of food in front of him.
3619198	eng	Tom looked over to his shoulder to see if anyone was following him.
3619199	eng	Tom motioned for Mary to approach him.
3619200	eng	Tom thinks that I'm in love with him.
3619201	eng	Tom took everything with him.
3619202	eng	Tom thought I was flirting with him.
3619203	eng	Tom wants me to work with him.
3619204	eng	Tom tried to persuade Mary to go to Boston with him.
3619205	eng	Tom ran too fast for us to catch up with him.
3619206	eng	Tom will come if you ask him.
3619207	eng	Tom says you still won't speak to him.
3619208	eng	Tom asked me if I could help him.
3619209	eng	Tom tried to persuade Mary to help him.
3619210	eng	Tom couldn't persuade Mary to help him.
3619211	eng	Tom is planning to ask Mary to help him.
3619212	eng	Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
3619213	eng	Tom's wife has left him.
3619214	eng	Tom's parents are probably worried about him.
3619215	eng	Tom was fat the last time I saw him.
3619216	eng	Tom signaled that I should follow him.
3619217	eng	Tom motioned for me to follow him.
3619218	eng	Tom motioned to Mary to follow him.
3619219	eng	Thank you very much, Tom.
3619220	eng	It's been a long time since we've visited Tom.
3619221	eng	I never said I believed Tom.
3619222	eng	I don't think I'm going to see Tom.
3619223	eng	I'm trying to get everyone to call me Tom.
3619224	eng	We've decided not to fire Tom.
3619225	eng	We've decided to hire Tom.
3619226	eng	I promise that I'll take care of Tom.
3619227	eng	I'm not going to let you go to the dance with Tom.
3619228	eng	I'm not going to play golf with Tom.
3619229	eng	I'll try to get in touch with Tom.
3619230	eng	I don't know how to deal with Tom.
3619231	eng	Call me after you've spoken with Tom.
3619232	eng	I'm not going to go to Boston with Tom.
3619233	eng	I don't think this has anything to do with Tom.
3619234	eng	I don't think that we should go with Tom.
3619235	eng	I don't think there's any point in discussing this with Tom.
3619236	eng	I don't think it's a good idea for you to hang out with Tom.
3619237	eng	None of the other kids want to play with Tom.
3619238	eng	I got a message from Tom.
3619239	eng	I was very close to Tom.
3619240	eng	I never even said goodbye to Tom.
3619241	eng	I'm just here to say hi to Tom.
3619242	eng	Actually, I just want to talk to Tom.
3619243	eng	I have no idea what to say to Tom.
3619244	eng	I'm trying as hard as I can to help Tom.
3619245	eng	I think you ought to offer to help Tom.
3619246	eng	The noise doesn't seem to bother Tom.
3619247	eng	This sounds like a job for Tom.
3619248	eng	I'm not going to wait for Tom.
3619249	eng	We've already done a lot for Tom.
3619250	eng	Nobody likes Tom.
3619251	eng	No one trusts Tom.
3619252	eng	I'm the only one who really knows Tom.
3619253	eng	I don't know who started the fire, but I'm sure it wasn't Tom.
3619254	eng	I don't think you're going to have the chance to meet Tom.
3619255	eng	I have to go to the airport to meet Tom.
3619256	eng	I need information about Tom.
3619257	eng	Tom looked into the rec room.
3619258	eng	I don't like the way Tom decorated his room.
3619259	eng	Tom promised he'd clean his room.
3619260	eng	Tom promised to clean his room.
3619261	eng	Tom has been spending a lot of time alone in his room.
3619262	eng	I don't like the way you decorated this room.
3619263	eng	I'm going to go to my room.
3619264	eng	I have a first aid kit in the bathroom.
3619265	eng	I don't think there's anyone in the classroom.
3619266	eng	I left my hat in the classroom.
3619267	eng	Let me put a fresh bandage on your arm.
3619268	eng	I'm going to head back to the dorm.
3619269	eng	I don't think we should go outside in this storm.
3619270	eng	I'm trying as hard as I can.
3619271	eng	I promise I'll be back as soon as I can.
3619272	eng	I'll try to get back as soon as I can.
3619273	eng	Tom has done everything he can.
3619274	eng	Tom is coming back here as quick as he can.
3619275	eng	Tom looked down at the ocean.
3619276	eng	Tom looked out at the ocean.
3619277	eng	I don't want you to say anything that you don't mean.
3619278	eng	I still don't know what you mean.
3619279	eng	Tom is an enormously gifted musician.
3619280	eng	Tom made a speech in support of the plan.
3619281	eng	I don't mind making a few changes to the plan.
3619282	eng	It's a simple plan.
3619283	eng	The police arrested the wrong man.
3619284	eng	I know how difficult it's been.
3619285	eng	Tom died when I was thirteen.
3619286	eng	Tom's parents got divorced when he was thirteen.
3619287	eng	Tom's parents died when he was thirteen.
3619288	eng	I found this in the kitchen.
3619289	eng	I don't know why the door was open.
3619290	eng	Tom wanted to see what would happen.
3619291	eng	I know exactly what'll happen.
3619292	eng	Tom has been waiting to see what'll happen.
3619293	eng	I need information about what's going to happen.
3619294	eng	I'm not able to have children.
3619295	eng	Tom has been trying to find someone to take care of his children.
3619296	eng	Tom wanted to hire Mary to take care of his children.
3619297	eng	Tom wished he had more time to spend with his children.
3619298	eng	I need to find someone who can take care of my children.
3619299	eng	Tom saw Mary smiling at John.
3619300	eng	The door opened and Tom walked in.
3619301	eng	I'm not going to go there again.
3619302	eng	Tom won't hurt himself again.
3619303	eng	Tom may never be able to walk again.
3619304	eng	I'll never play golf with Tom again.
3619305	eng	I'll never go camping with Tom again.
3619306	eng	I'll never go out with Tom again.
3619307	eng	I'm never going to have to talk to Tom again.
3619308	eng	I'm never going to talk to Tom again.
3619309	eng	I really want to go to Boston again.
3619310	eng	I'm afraid we'll have to start over again.
3619311	eng	I don't think I can do this again.
3619312	eng	I'm not going to do this again.
3619313	eng	I promise I'll never do this again.
3619314	eng	I recommend that you don't do that again.
3619315	eng	I'm never going to complain about that again.
3619316	eng	I won't be able to do it again.
3619317	eng	I'm glad I got a chance to see you again.
3619318	eng	I really want to kiss you again.
3619319	eng	I'm not going to yell at you again.
3619320	eng	I'll never be able to trust you again.
3619321	eng	It's a little complicated to explain.
3619322	eng	It's a little difficult to explain.
3619323	eng	The doctor gave me something for the pain.
3619324	eng	Tom looks like he's in pain.
3619325	eng	Tom's hair is wet from the rain.
3619326	eng	I don't know how long I can hold on.
3619327	eng	I've got to find out what's going on.
3619328	eng	I have a report I need to work on.
3619329	eng	Tom jumped into the water with his clothes on.
3619330	eng	Please leave the light on.
3619331	eng	I promise I'll be nice to you from now on.
3619332	eng	I'd like to get another opinion.
3619333	eng	It was a simple decision.
3619334	eng	Tom wanted me to meet him at the station.
3619335	eng	It's a very complicated situation.
3619336	eng	It's a tense situation.
3619337	eng	I just wanted to see if you were paying attention.
3619338	eng	Tom noticed Mary wasn't paying attention.
3619339	eng	I'd like you to pay attention.
3619340	eng	I still have a question.
3619341	eng	Tom has agreed to help us find a solution.
3619342	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if you ate one of the cookies he baked this afternoon.
3619343	eng	Tom will take a walk in the park this afternoon.
3619344	eng	I don't think Tom is feeling very well this afternoon.
3619345	eng	Tom wants me to help him this afternoon.
3619346	eng	I have other things I want to do this afternoon.
3619347	eng	I have a job interview tomorrow afternoon.
3619348	eng	I found out that Tom was here yesterday afternoon.
3619349	eng	Tom wanted to play tennis yesterday afternoon.
3619350	eng	I don't think we can do it that soon.
3619351	eng	Tom looked down at his weapon.
3619352	eng	Tom is the closest thing I have to a son.
3619353	eng	I have a thirteen-year-old son.
3619354	eng	Tom wouldn't have married Mary if he'd known she had spent time in prison.
3619355	eng	I thought you were in prison.
3619356	eng	Tom's parents never visited him in prison.
3619357	eng	Tom has spent the past three years in prison.
3619358	eng	I don't think I know anyone named Tom Jackson.
3619359	eng	Tom's real last name is Jackson.
3619360	eng	Tom is a very practical person.
3619361	eng	Tom has always been a very cheerful person.
3619362	eng	I have a feeling you're going to like Boston.
3619363	eng	Tom spends every weekend in Boston.
3619364	eng	I'd really rather be in Boston.
3619365	eng	Tom and I used to live in Boston.
3619366	eng	I think Tom used to live in Boston.
3619367	eng	I have a feeling I'm going to really like living in Boston.
3619368	eng	Tom's only living relative is an uncle living in Boston.
3619369	eng	I thought you were still in Boston.
3619370	eng	I don't know how many times Tom has gone to Boston.
3619371	eng	I've decided to move to Boston.
3619372	eng	I've just decided to move to Boston.
3619373	eng	I don't think Tom should go back to Boston.
3619374	eng	Tom is going to go back to Boston.
3619375	eng	I think we ought to go back to Boston.
3619376	eng	I'm getting ready to go back to Boston.
3619377	eng	I'm not going to let you go back to Boston.
3619378	eng	Tom wanted to go to Boston.
3619379	eng	I thought you were going to go to Boston.
3619380	eng	I'm not so sure I want to go to Boston.
3619381	eng	I'm not going to pretend that I don't want to go to Boston.
3619382	eng	I'm really going to miss Tom when he moves to Boston.
3619383	eng	Tom looked toward the horizon.
3619384	eng	I'm sorry if I spoke out of turn.
3619385	eng	I'm just trying to have a little fun.
3619386	eng	Tom looks like he's having fun.
3619387	eng	I don't think this is going to be much fun.
3619388	eng	I'm not going to have any fun.
3619389	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to be having any fun.
3619390	eng	I have a permit for this gun.
3619391	eng	I have a business to run.
3619392	eng	Tom has been up since dawn.
3619393	eng	You'll have to do that on your own.
3619394	eng	That's a very generous offer, but I have to turn it down.
3619395	eng	I'm afraid I have to turn you down.
3619396	eng	Tom has more experience than I do.
3619397	eng	I'm here to make sure you do what you said you'd do.
3619398	eng	I'm just trying to get you do what you said you'd do.
3619399	eng	I'm not sure what else I should do.
3619400	eng	I'm afraid there is very little I can do.
3619401	eng	I don't know what else I can do.
3619402	eng	We've already done everything we can do.
3619403	eng	I'm not sure what else I need to do.
3619404	eng	I'm sure you have things you need to do.
3619405	eng	There's something I really need to do.
3619406	eng	I asked Tom what he wanted to do.
3619407	eng	Tom wasn't able to do what he wanted to do.
3619408	eng	I wish I had more time to do things that I really wanted to do.
3619409	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom really wanted to do.
3619410	eng	I don't want to do what Tom asked me to do.
3619411	eng	I did everything Tom wanted me to do.
3619412	eng	I'm doing exactly what you told me to do.
3619413	eng	I'm not sure I can do what you want me to do.
3619414	eng	Tom couldn't come here today because he had something else to do.
3619415	eng	I'll do what I have to do.
3619416	eng	I don't know exactly what I'm going to do.
3619417	eng	I have to let Tom know what he needs to do.
3619418	eng	I'm sure Tom has other things to do.
3619419	eng	I have no way of stopping Tom from doing whatever he wants to do.
3619420	eng	I don't need to be told what to do.
3619421	eng	I've been waiting for Tom to tell me what to do.
3619422	eng	Tom has been telling everyone what to do.
3619423	eng	I'm not sure I know what to do.
3619424	eng	Tom would know what to do.
3619425	eng	I'll bet Tom will know what to do.
3619426	eng	Tom admitted that he didn't know what to do.
3619427	eng	Tom seems to be the only one who doesn't know what to do.
3619428	eng	I assume you know what to do.
3619429	eng	I'm not sure I really know what to do.
3619430	eng	I don't have time to do everything I want to do.
3619431	eng	Tom doesn't want to say he did something he didn't do.
3619432	eng	I know more than you do.
3619433	eng	I don't like what Tom did any more than you do.
3619434	eng	I don't like Tom any more than you do.
3619435	eng	I don't like it any better than you do.
3619436	eng	I'd really like to go.
3619437	eng	I'm sorry, but I have to go.
3619438	eng	I'm sorry, but I really have to go.
3619439	eng	I don't know where I'm going to go.
3619440	eng	We don't want Tom to go.
3619441	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go.
3619442	eng	Tom told us the reason why he didn't want to go.
3619443	eng	I assume you don't want to go.
3619444	eng	I think it's time for you to go.
3619445	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't go.
3619446	eng	I have to let you go.
3619447	eng	Tom's visa expired three months ago.
3619448	eng	Tom died in a plane crash three months ago.
3619449	eng	I'm not the same person I was three years ago.
3619450	eng	Tom is far better off than he was three years ago.
3619451	eng	Tom is better off now than he was three years ago.
3619452	eng	I have to help Tom and Mary move a piano.
3619453	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't want to go to the zoo.
3619454	eng	I was willing to do it, but Tom said I didn't need to.
3619455	eng	I don't like being lied to.
3619456	eng	I'm beginning to think you don't like me as much as you used to.
3619457	eng	I'll help you do that if you want me to.
3619458	eng	I'm not the one you should be talking to.
3619459	eng	I'm the one you should be listening to.
3619460	eng	I don't know who Tom might've spoken to.
3619461	eng	Tom doesn't want to do this, but he says he has to.
3619462	eng	I'll be all right in a minute or two.
3619463	eng	Tom is wearing my cap.
3619464	eng	I was worried it was a trap.
3619465	eng	I don't know if I'm going to be able to sleep.
3619466	eng	I'm going to try to get back to sleep.
3619467	eng	Tom is almost back to sleep.
3619468	eng	I'm going to give you something to help you sleep.
3619469	eng	Tom is half asleep.
3619470	eng	I'm going to need a little help.
3619471	eng	I don't think Tom is going to be too much help.
3619472	eng	I don't think Tom needs very much help.
3619473	eng	I'm not the one who volunteered to help.
3619474	eng	I think I know who might be able to help.
3619475	eng	Tom is doing everything possible to help.
3619476	eng	I was only trying to help.
3619477	eng	I'm going to do everything I can to help.
3619478	eng	I'm afraid there is very little I can do to help.
3619479	eng	I'm not sure what else I can do to help.
3619480	eng	Tom is going to ask you to help.
3619481	eng	Tom is going to try to help.
3619482	eng	Tom is the one who asked for help.
3619483	eng	Tom is going to need our help.
3619484	eng	I don't think Tom is the one who needs help.
3619485	eng	There's no way Tom could've done this without help.
3619486	eng	I'm here because I thought you needed my help.
3619487	eng	I'm not sure I can be of any help.
3619488	eng	Tom didn't want to argue with Mary, so he let the matter drop.
3619489	eng	Tom is pretty sharp.
3619490	eng	Tom was supposed to come over this afternoon, but he never showed up.
3619491	eng	Tom should've stayed and helped us clean up.
3619492	eng	I think Mary looks better without makeup.

3619572	eng	I'm glad this is all over.
3619573	eng	I think the movie is almost over.
3619574	eng	I still need an answer.
3619575	eng	That's a question I can't answer.
3619576	eng	I'm not leaving until I get what I came for.
3619577	eng	I'm pretty sure we got everything we came for.
3619578	eng	I think I'm the person you're looking for.

3619644	eng	Tom is dressed a bit more conservative today than he usually is.
3619645	eng	I don't think Tom knows where Mary is.
3619646	eng	Tom might know where Mary is.
3619647	eng	I think you might want to read this.

3619649	eng	I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stand this.
3619650	eng	I don't know how much longer I can stand this.

3619654	eng	I'm tired of living like this.
3619655	eng	I have a feeling you're going to like this.
3619656	eng	I need you to handle this.

3619674	eng	I don't think anyone can do this.
3619675	eng	I've been ordered to do this.
3619676	eng	I don't think that this is a good time to do this.
3619677	eng	I'm the one who has to do this.
3619678	eng	I forbid you to do this.
3619679	eng	Tom might know how to do this.
3619680	eng	I don't know exactly how to do this.
3619681	eng	I think I could get used to this.
3619682	eng	I'm not sure Tom is going to agree to this.
3619683	eng	I'm really not in the mood for this.
3619684	eng	I paid a lot of money for this.
3619685	eng	I don't think I have the energy for this.
3619686	eng	I don't think this is the time or place to discuss this.
3619687	eng	I'm just no good at this.
3619688	eng	I think you should look at this.
3619689	eng	I have a feeling I'm going to regret this.
3619690	eng	I assume you don't want this.
3619691	eng	I want to know more about this.
3619692	eng	I don't think we should be talking about this.
3619693	eng	I don't know what I'm going to do about this.
3619694	eng	I'm really nervous about this.
3619695	eng	I'm fairly sure I'm right about this.
3619696	eng	Tom's not going to be happy about this.
3619697	eng	I'm not sure where to put this.
3619698	eng	Tom wanted me to bring you this.
3619699	eng	I don't think I can fix this.
3619700	eng	I don't know how to fix this.
3619701	eng	I'm really beginning to enjoy this.
3619702	eng	I don't think we should buy this.
3619703	eng	I've never been very good at tennis.
3619704	eng	I don't like watching tennis with people who don't know anything about tennis.
3619705	eng	It's a plausible diagnosis.
3619706	eng	I just wanted to stop by and say thanks.
3619707	eng	Maybe we should ask Tom what he thinks.
3619708	eng	I think you ought to pay closer attention to details.
3619709	eng	I'm the one who has to pay all the bills.
3619710	eng	I don't like having to pay your bills.
3619711	eng	I'll see you in my dreams.
3619712	eng	I don't think you understand what this means.

3619726	eng	I've loved you since we were teenagers.
3619727	eng	We might have to hire some new waiters.

3619765	eng	I don't know how much the ticket costs.
3619766	eng	I'm not supposed to eat peanuts.
3619767	eng	Tom shouldn't eat peanuts.
3619768	eng	Make sure Tom doesn't eat any peanuts.
3619769	eng	Tom made coffee for all of us.
3619770	eng	I'd like you to ride with us.
3619771	eng	Tom may not agree with us.

3619786	eng	I'm the one who convinced Tom to help us.
3619787	eng	I don't know how I'm going to get Tom to help us.
3619788	eng	Tom has done everything he can to help us.
3619789	eng	I'm going to have to get the others to help us.
3619790	eng	Tom may not even remember us.

3619808	eng	I really need to get something to eat.
3619809	eng	I'm not used to this heat.
3619810	eng	Tom has probably never eaten dog meat.
3619811	eng	I'm the one who gave Tom that hat.
3619812	eng	I don't like the way Tom did that.
3619813	eng	I'll soon change that.
3619814	eng	It's a little like that.
3619815	eng	I don't think I can do anything like that.
3619816	eng	I'm choosing to ignore that.
3619817	eng	I don't think that you really believe that.
3619818	eng	I kind of enjoyed doing that.
3619819	eng	I don't think you should be doing that.
3619820	eng	Tom shouldn't be doing that.
3619821	eng	I have a lot of trouble doing that.
3619822	eng	I don't think Tom has any intention of doing that.
3619823	eng	I'm going to try my best to prevent Tom from doing that.
3619824	eng	I don't think that we should even consider doing that.
3619825	eng	I don't know why Tom's doing that.
3619826	eng	I don't think I can help you with that.
3619827	eng	I'm not sure I'll be able to help you with that.
3619828	eng	I don't think we can risk that.
3619829	eng	I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that.
3619830	eng	It's a lot worse than that.
3619831	eng	Next time, you'll need to do a lot better than that.
3619832	eng	It looks like Tom isn't interested in that.
3619833	eng	I don't know what made me think I could do that.
3619834	eng	I don't think that we should do that.
3619835	eng	I don't think Tom should do that.
3619836	eng	I think I'm the person who should do that.

3619842	eng	I never wanted to do that.
3619843	eng	I don't know if I'm allowed to do that.
3619844	eng	I think I'm not allowed to do that.
3619845	eng	I'm sure we'll be able to do that.
3619846	eng	It's a crime to do that.
3619847	eng	I don't know if I'll have the time to do that.
3619848	eng	I don't think I have enough time to do that.
3619849	eng	I don't think I'm going to do that.
3619850	eng	Tom seems to be the only one who wants to do that.
3619851	eng	I don't think Tom meant to do that.
3619852	eng	I don't know why Tom would want to do that.
3619853	eng	I've decided not to do that.
3619854	eng	I've asked you not to do that.
3619855	eng	I'm not going to ask you to do that.
3619856	eng	I'm not sure it's a good idea for you to do that.
3619857	eng	I'm not sure it's wise for you to do that.
3619858	eng	I paid Tom a lot of money to do that.
3619859	eng	I'd feel a lot better if we didn't do that.
3619860	eng	I recommend that you don't do that.
3619861	eng	I don't know why we let you do that.
3619862	eng	I don't know if I can get used to that.
3619863	eng	I don't think this is the time or place for that.
3619864	eng	I don't think we have the time for that.
3619865	eng	It's a little late for that.
3619866	eng	Tom isn't the only one who thinks that.
3619867	eng	I'd advise you to not eat that.
3619868	eng	I'd really rather not eat that.
3619869	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to tell Mary anything about that.
3619870	eng	I don't know what we can do about that.
3619871	eng	I don't know what to do about that.
3619872	eng	I've got to make sure Tom doesn't tell Mary about that.
3619873	eng	Tom is the one who talked to Mary about that.
3619874	eng	Tom is going to talk to Mary about that.
3619875	eng	I can promise you that.
3619876	eng	I figured you already knew that.
3619877	eng	I thought you were going to say that.
3619878	eng	I think I'm going to enjoy that.
3619879	eng	It's a well-known fact.
3619880	eng	Tom is pretty good at changing the subject.
3619881	eng	That's a frightening prospect.
3619882	eng	I have someone here you might like to meet.
3619883	eng	I'm fairly certain Tom lives on Park Street.
3619884	eng	I know a great Italian restaurant on Park Street.
3619885	eng	Tom is the person who owns the store across the street.
3619886	eng	I'm going to need all the help I can get.
3619887	eng	I'd appreciate it if you would be quiet.
3619888	eng	I'm going to the supermarket.
3619889	eng	I'm sure no one here stole your wallet.
3619890	eng	I don't believe we've ever met.
3619891	eng	Tom looked down at the carpet.
3619892	eng	If you hadn't done that, Tom wouldn't have gotten upset.
3619893	eng	I don't think I've ever seen you so upset.
3619894	eng	Tom is extremely upset.
3619895	eng	Tom isn't dead yet.
3619896	eng	Tom isn't a millionaire yet.
3619897	eng	I don't think I'm ready to leave yet.
3619898	eng	I'm not ready to go back yet.
3619899	eng	I don't know Tom well enough to dislike him yet.
3619900	eng	Tom doesn't know all the rules yet.
3619901	eng	I don't know if I'm ready to do this yet.
3619902	eng	I don't think we should tell anybody about this yet.
3619903	eng	I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
3619904	eng	I don't think we should tell anybody just yet.
3619905	eng	I'm glad you got a chance to talk to Tom before he left.
3619906	eng	I thought Tom left.
3619907	eng	Tom is probably trying to lose weight.
3619908	eng	Tom is having trouble losing weight.
3619909	eng	Tom looks like he's been up all night.
3619910	eng	I was up late last night.
3619911	eng	I just wanted to say thank you for last night.
3619912	eng	Maybe we shouldn't have gone to Tom's party last night.
3619913	eng	I'll see you tomorrow night.
3619914	eng	Tom doesn't always go to bed before midnight.
3619915	eng	I really want to eat Chinese food tonight.
3619916	eng	Tom is going to come back here tonight.
3619917	eng	I have a big date tonight.
3619918	eng	I have a report to write tonight.
3619919	eng	I have plans with Tom tonight.
3619920	eng	I don't think we'll be able to hang out together tonight.
3619921	eng	I want to take you out to dinner tonight.
3619922	eng	I'm going over to Tom's tonight.
3619923	eng	Tom is going to call you tonight.
3619924	eng	I really need to study tonight.
3619925	eng	I'll ask Tom about Mary tonight.
3619926	eng	I heard that Tom won't be at your party tonight.
3619927	eng	I just wanted to make sure you were all right.
3619928	eng	I'm afraid I was right.
3619929	eng	I just wanted to make sure I was right.
3619930	eng	I'm going to do what I believe is right.
3619931	eng	I've got to do what I believe is right.
3619932	eng	I'm doing what I think is right.
3619933	eng	It's a nice thought.
3619934	eng	The situation is much worse than we thought.
3619935	eng	That's a frightening thought.
3619936	eng	That's a horrifying thought.
3619937	eng	I don't think you need it.
3619938	eng	Tom's phone rang, but he ignored it.
3619939	eng	I did everything the same way Tom did it.
3619940	eng	I already know who did it.
3619941	eng	Tom doesn't want to open the box, but he wants to know what's inside it.
3619942	eng	I'm glad that you could make it.
3619943	eng	I have no idea who might've done it.
3619944	eng	The price is kind of high, but it's worth it.
3619945	eng	I'm going to risk it.
3619946	eng	If Tom had tried harder, he would've been able to do it.
3619947	eng	I did everything the way Tom told me to do it.
3619948	eng	I have a great deal to do and very little time to do it.
3619949	eng	Tom promised to show me how to do it.
3619950	eng	Tom admitted that he didn't know how to do it.
3619951	eng	I really think this is the best way to do it.
3619952	eng	I don't know how you do it.
3619953	eng	I'll get used to it.
3619954	eng	I'll do my best to stop it.
3619955	eng	Tom is extremely handsome and he knows it.
3619956	eng	I don't know what can be done about it.
3619957	eng	I think we should talk about it.
3619958	eng	I don't know what you expect me to do about it.
3619959	eng	I'm going to fix it.
3619960	eng	I know exactly how to fix it.
3619961	eng	I think we should try it.
3619962	eng	I don't know how much longer we'll need to wait.
3619963	eng	I wonder how long we'll have to wait.
3619964	eng	I'll go see how much longer we'll have to wait.
3619965	eng	I don't deserve all the credit.
3619966	eng	I'm afraid it's entirely my fault.
3619967	eng	I know this will be difficult.
3619968	eng	Tom can be a little difficult.
3619969	eng	I don't think that's what Tom meant.
3619970	eng	I'm pretty sure that isn't what Tom meant.
3619971	eng	I'm going to let you do whatever you want.
3619972	eng	Tom lost his parents in a traffic accident.
3619973	eng	Tom was almost killed in the accident.
3619974	eng	Tom is still a high school student.
3619975	eng	Tom said we should be patient.
3619976	eng	Tom is getting a little impatient.
3619977	eng	That's a definite improvement.
3619978	eng	Tom remained quiet for a moment.
3619979	eng	It was a tense moment.
3619980	eng	This is a nice apartment.
3619981	eng	Tom forgot to pay his rent.
3619982	eng	Maybe Tom and Mary aren't so different.
3619983	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me where he went.
3619984	eng	I think it's time you went.
3619985	eng	Tom looks like he's about to faint.
3619986	eng	I'm trying to make a point.
3619987	eng	All right, Tom, you've made your point.
3619988	eng	I was supposed to buy some milk on my way home, but I forgot.
3619989	eng	I'm tired of hearing you call Tom an idiot.
3619990	eng	Tom and I used to argue a lot.
3619991	eng	Tom's car is in the parking lot.
3619992	eng	I don't know Tom well enough to know whether I like him or not.
3619993	eng	I don't know if I can do that or not.
3619994	eng	Tom is barefoot.
3619995	eng	I won't put you on the spot.
3619996	eng	I don't know anything about art.
3619997	eng	I missed the beginning of the concert.
3619998	eng	It's a shame you're going to miss the concert.
3619999	eng	I got us two tickets to Tom's concert.
3620000	eng	Tom looked down at his shirt.
3620001	eng	Tom said he paid thirty dollars for that shirt.
3620002	eng	I'm going to have to cut this short.
3620003	eng	Tom is awfully short.
3620004	eng	Tom is very short.
3620005	eng	Tom is alone in his office, writing a report.
3620006	eng	I don't think Tom is the one who wrote this report.
3620007	eng	I just wanted to thank you for your support.
3620008	eng	We don't want Tom to get hurt.
3620009	eng	Tom is eating breakfast.
3620010	eng	I have to do what I think is best.
3620011	eng	Tom promised to do his best.
3620012	eng	Tom looks like he could use some rest.
3620013	eng	I think Tom might have cheated on the test.
3620014	eng	Tom barely managed to pass the test.
3620015	eng	Tom wasn't able to pass the test.
3620016	eng	Tom is a freelance journalist.
3620017	eng	Tom is an excellent guitarist.
3620018	eng	I don't think this is the one I lost.
3620019	eng	I don't know who we can trust.
3620020	eng	I don't know yet, but I mean to find out.
3620021	eng	I don't know yet, but I plan to find out.
3620022	eng	I'm not going to wait to find out.
3620023	eng	I'm counting on you to help me out.
3620024	eng	Tom looks like he's going to pass out.
3620025	eng	The elevator opened and Tom got out.
3620026	eng	I'm going to help you out.
3620027	eng	I have some old clothes I'm going to throw out.
3620028	eng	I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
3620029	eng	I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.
3620030	eng	I have absolutely no idea what Tom's talking about.
3620031	eng	I'm sure you guys have a lot to talk about.
3620032	eng	I'm sure you have a lot to think about.
3620033	eng	I don't know what it was about.
3620034	eng	I have no idea what this is about.
3620035	eng	I'll never treat you the way Tom treated you.
3620036	eng	I underestimated you.
3620037	eng	I'm so sorry that I doubted you.
3620038	eng	I'm not sure what I've done to offend you.
3620039	eng	Tom may have misunderstood you.
3620040	eng	Tom will be delighted to see you.
3620041	eng	A boy named Tom came to see you.
3620042	eng	Tom is here to see you.
3620043	eng	I was just coming to see you.
3620044	eng	Tom wasn't expecting to see you.
3620045	eng	Tom really does like you.
3620046	eng	Tom must've been a lot like you.
3620047	eng	I'm sorry if I woke you.
3620048	eng	Tom isn't going to leave you.
3620049	eng	I just wanted to say I don't believe you.
3620050	eng	I've never loved anyone as much as I love you.
3620051	eng	I've never loved anybody as much as I love you.
3620052	eng	I'm proud of each and every one of you.
3620053	eng	I'm the one who'll take care of you.
3620054	eng	I need a word with you.
3620055	eng	I'd like a word with you.
3620056	eng	Tom would like a word with you.
3620057	eng	I intend to come with you.
3620058	eng	I'd like to stay here with you.
3620059	eng	I'd rather stay here with you.
3620060	eng	I have no interest in going fishing with you.
3620061	eng	I don't think I want to study French with you.
3620062	eng	I have someone here who'd like to speak with you.
3620063	eng	Tom isn't going back with you.
3620064	eng	Maybe you can get Tom to run the marathon with you.
3620065	eng	I don't intend to go to Boston with you.
3620066	eng	I've decided not to go to Boston with you.
3620067	eng	Tom isn't going to break up with you.
3620068	eng	I'm willing to discuss the matter with you.
3620069	eng	I don't think there's any point in discussing this matter with you.
3620070	eng	There are a lot of things I want to discuss with you.
3620071	eng	You can't go yet. There are a lot of things I want to discuss with you.
3620072	eng	I haven't been totally honest with you.
3620073	eng	I'd much rather stay with you.
3620074	eng	I don't know how I can ever thank you.
3620075	eng	I have a couple of questions I need to ask you.
3620076	eng	There's something I think I should tell you.
3620077	eng	Tom wouldn't steal from you.
3620078	eng	Tom wants me to stay away from you.
3620079	eng	I can run much faster than you.
3620080	eng	I don't know anybody who does that better than you.
3620081	eng	I'd be delighted to join you.
3620082	eng	I have my eye on you.
3620083	eng	I know I can count on you.
3620084	eng	I'm so sorry that I lied to you.
3620085	eng	I'm sorry for what I said to you.
3620086	eng	Tom says he regrets having been rude to you.
3620087	eng	I feel very close to you.
3620088	eng	Tom left his entire estate to you.
3620089	eng	Tom, I need to talk to you.
3620090	eng	I'll listen to you.
3620091	eng	I never could say no to you.
3620092	eng	I'm sorry I can't be of more help to you.
3620093	eng	I would never do that to you.
3620094	eng	I'm here because I think I can help you.
3620095	eng	I'm pretty sure we can help you.
3620096	eng	I'm not supposed to help you.
3620097	eng	Tom wanted me to help you.
3620098	eng	I've done everything I can to help you.
3620099	eng	I'm trying to figure out how to help you.
3620100	eng	I'm trying to figure out a way to help you.
3620101	eng	Of course I remember you.
3620102	eng	Tom left some money on the table for you.
3620103	eng	I'll try to make things as easy as possible for you.
3620104	eng	I promise I'll try to make things as easy as possible for you.
3620105	eng	I'm glad I could do something for you.
3620106	eng	Tom must be looking for you.
3620107	eng	I believe Tom is looking for you.
3620108	eng	Mary isn't the right girl for you.
3620109	eng	Tom isn't the right man for you.
3620110	eng	I'm not sure what else I can do for you.
3620111	eng	I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
3620112	eng	I'll clean it up for you.
3620113	eng	I don't like having to make excuses for you.
3620114	eng	Tom still has feelings for you.
3620115	eng	Tom, I'm doing this for you.
3620116	eng	Tom must've left this for you.
3620117	eng	I'll clean up this mess for you.
3620118	eng	I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
3620119	eng	I'm afraid we have some bad news for you.
3620120	eng	I don't mind doing that for you.
3620121	eng	I know Tom misses you.
3620122	eng	I'm going to kiss you.
3620123	eng	I feel like I want to kiss you.
3620124	eng	I'm still a little mad at you.
3620125	eng	Tom sent me here to protect you.
3620126	eng	Tom was trying to protect you.
3620127	eng	Tom was only trying to protect you.
3620128	eng	I'll do everything I can to protect you.
3620129	eng	Tom really wants to meet you.
3620130	eng	Tom sent me to get you.
3620131	eng	Tom sent me over to get you.
3620132	eng	I'm trying to remember the first time I met you.
3620133	eng	I have a feeling you're not going to like the gift Tom got you.
3620134	eng	I'm not going to allow anybody to hurt you.
3620135	eng	I would never hurt you.
3620136	eng	I think I can really trust you.
3620137	eng	Tom has been complaining about you.
3620138	eng	I've heard so much about you.
3620139	eng	I've heard all about you.
3620140	eng	Tom has been saying good things about you.
3620141	eng	I don't know what I would've done without you.
3620142	eng	I don't know what we would've done without you.
3620143	eng	I don't know what I would do without you.
3620144	eng	I don't know if I can do this without you.
3620145	eng	Tom isn't going to marry you.
3620146	eng	Tom was amused by what he saw.
3620147	eng	I'd appreciate it if you would open a window.
3620148	eng	Tom looked in through the window.
3620149	eng	I have no idea who might've broken the window.
3620150	eng	I'm here to fix the broken window.
3620151	eng	Tom looked out the open window.
3620152	eng	Tom looked out the front window.
3620153	eng	Tom is feeling OK now.
3620154	eng	Maybe we should go home now.
3620155	eng	I really want to go home now.
3620156	eng	I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
3620157	eng	I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave now.
3620158	eng	I have to find Tom now.
3620159	eng	Tom may not even be in Boston now.
3620160	eng	I'm fairly sure Tom is in Boston now.
3620161	eng	I don't know what I'm going to do now.
3620162	eng	I think it's over now.
3620163	eng	I don't have a choice. I have to do this now.
3620164	eng	I'd really rather not talk about this now.
3620165	eng	It's a little late for that now.
3620166	eng	I don't think that's a good idea right now.
3620167	eng	Tom is probably looking for me right now.
3620168	eng	I'm sort of in the middle of something right now.
3620169	eng	I'm the only one who can help Tom right now.
3620170	eng	I really have to do this right now.
3620171	eng	I'm really not in the mood for this right now.
3620172	eng	I don't think we should be talking about this right now.
3620173	eng	I'm sorry, I can't talk about this right now.
3620174	eng	Tom is probably listening to us right now.
3620175	eng	I don't think I have time to explain it right now.
3620176	eng	I have to speak with you right now.
3620177	eng	It's a lot different now.
3620178	eng	I'm just too tired to help you now.
3620179	eng	Tom has probably already gone to bed by now.
3620180	eng	I thought Tom would be awake by now.
3620181	eng	Tom should've finished his homework by now.
3620182	eng	Tom should've arrived in Boston by now.
3620183	eng	I thought Tom would be asleep by now.
3620184	eng	I don't mind telling you what I know.
3620185	eng	If you lie to me, I'll know.
3620186	eng	There's something I think you need to know.
3620187	eng	I'm not allowed to tell you what you want to know.
3620188	eng	I don't like talking to people I don't know.
3620189	eng	I can't tell you where Tom is because I don't know.
3620190	eng	It's still a little early for snow.
3620191	eng	I'm not going to be here tomorrow.
3620192	eng	Tom will go to Boston tomorrow.
3620193	eng	I'm afraid I may not be able to help you tomorrow.
3620194	eng	Tom looked in the cardboard box.
3620195	eng	Tom checks his blood pressure twice a day.
3620196	eng	I think it was a good day.
3620197	eng	I'm not usually here this time of day.
3620198	eng	I'm tired of eating the same thing every day.
3620199	eng	I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
3620200	eng	I'm sorry I missed your party last Friday.
3620201	eng	Tom has decided not to stay until Monday.
3620202	eng	I promise I'll come by to see you on Monday.
3620203	eng	I don't think I can help you on Monday.
3620204	eng	Tom is probably going to be busy on Monday.
3620205	eng	Tom has been missing since last Monday.
3620206	eng	Tom has been absent since last Monday.
3620207	eng	Tom will be back by Monday.
3620208	eng	Tom looks tired today.
3620209	eng	Tom doesn't want to eat Italian food today.
3620210	eng	I don't think we should go outside today.
3620211	eng	I really had a good time today.
3620212	eng	I don't think Tom is coming back here today.
3620213	eng	Tom isn't here today.
3620214	eng	I never saw Tom before today.
3620215	eng	I can't be late today.
3620216	eng	I thought you were off today.
3620217	eng	Tom has probably already been to the bank today.
3620218	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be at school today.
3620219	eng	I heard that Tom wasn't at school today.
3620220	eng	I really want to see Tom today.
3620221	eng	I recommend that you don't talk to Tom today.
3620222	eng	Tom doesn't think banks are open today.
3620223	eng	I don't think it's going to rain today.
3620224	eng	I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
3620225	eng	Tom wasn't paying attention in class today.
3620226	eng	It's a pity Tom isn't able to be with us today.
3620227	eng	It's a pity Tom isn't with us today.
3620228	eng	I have no intention of doing that today.
3620229	eng	I'm not going to do that today.
3620230	eng	Tom is going to try to talk to Mary about that today.
3620231	eng	I have a feeling it's going to snow today.
3620232	eng	I'm probably going to have to leave work a little early today.
3620233	eng	I was wondering if I could go home early today.
3620234	eng	Tom asked me if he could go home early today.
3620235	eng	I'm going to have to go home early today.
3620236	eng	Tom is going to want to talk to you about what happened yesterday.
3620237	eng	I'm sorry for the way I acted yesterday.
3620238	eng	I'm sorry I couldn't be here yesterday.
3620239	eng	I think I know why Tom wasn't at school yesterday.
3620240	eng	I met one of your old girlfriends yesterday.
3620241	eng	I wonder how much we'll have to pay.
3620242	eng	I promised Tom I'd listen to what he had to say.
3620243	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom really wanted to say.
3620244	eng	I don't know exactly what to say.
3620245	eng	I don't believe anything you say.
3620246	eng	I don't think we should stay.
3620247	eng	I don't know how much longer I can stay.
3620248	eng	I don't know how much longer I'll be allowed to stay.
3620249	eng	I'm not sure it's wise for me to stay.
3620250	eng	I'm sorry if I got in the way.
3620251	eng	Tom was careful not to get in Mary's way.
3620252	eng	Tom isn't the only one who feels that way.
3620253	eng	Tom didn't go into the room right away.
3620254	eng	I have to tell Tom about this right away.
3620255	eng	I never listen to Tom anyway.
3620256	eng	Tom said you might be coming by.
3620257	eng	Tom told me you'd stop by.
3620258	eng	I'll let you know when I'm ready.
3620259	eng	Tom is thirty minutes late already.
3620260	eng	Tom was careful not to get his shoes muddy.
3620261	eng	Tom swore he wasn't going to say anything to anybody.
3620262	eng	I'm as surprised as anybody.
3620263	eng	I'm not in it for the money.
3620264	eng	Tom was only trying to save a little money.
3620265	eng	I have lots of money.
3620266	eng	Tom is going to have to start saving money.
3620267	eng	I don't think this will be enough money.
3620268	eng	Tom said you stole my money.
3620269	eng	I'm not going to lend you any money.
3620270	eng	It's a little late for an apology.
3620271	eng	Tom looked out the window at the sky.
3620272	eng	I have to speak with you immediately.
3620273	eng	I must speak with you immediately.
3620274	eng	Tom wouldn't harm a fly.
3620275	eng	I'm not from a rich family.
3620276	eng	I'm pretty sure I'll get used to this eventually.
3620277	eng	Tom should've driven more carefully.
3620278	eng	I've learned to listen carefully.
3620279	eng	Tom said he had to go home early.
3620280	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if you left early.
3620281	eng	I'm not sure I really know how to do it correctly.
3620282	eng	I'm not in the mood for company.
3620283	eng	It's a little bit funny.
3620284	eng	I won't be at the opening ceremony.
3620285	eng	I'm beginning to feel a little sleepy.
3620286	eng	Tom looks like he's sleepy.
3620287	eng	Tom's not going to be happy.
3620288	eng	I don't think I've ever seen you so happy.
3620289	eng	Tom looks like he's happy.
3620290	eng	I smiled and pretended I was happy.
3620291	eng	I don't want you to think I'm unhappy.
3620292	eng	Tom leaned down and kissed Mary.
3620293	eng	Tom took another step toward Mary.
3620294	eng	Tom turned around to face Mary.
3620295	eng	Tom knows how to deal with people like Mary.
3620296	eng	Tom doesn't know how to deal with people like Mary.
3620297	eng	I think I know why Tom doesn't like Mary.
3620298	eng	Tom has been telling everyone you hate Mary.
3620299	eng	Tom has been accused of murdering Mary.
3620300	eng	Tom reached out to touch Mary.
3620301	eng	Tom thinks I'm in love with Mary.
3620302	eng	Tom will do anything to avoid arguing with Mary.
3620303	eng	Tom goes to school with Mary.
3620304	eng	Tom went to school with Mary.
3620305	eng	I don't like the idea of Tom going out with Mary.
3620306	eng	I can understand why Tom wouldn't want you to go to Boston by with Mary.
3620307	eng	Tom wants me to stay away from Mary.
3620308	eng	Tom is a few years older than Mary.
3620309	eng	Tom says he's never seen Mary.
3620310	eng	I don't think Tom ever talked to Mary.
3620311	eng	Maybe we shouldn't have told Tom about what happened to Mary.
3620312	eng	Tom never even said goodbye to Mary.
3620313	eng	Tom says he'll only speak to Mary.
3620314	eng	Tom is going to have to talk to Mary.
3620315	eng	Tom has probably already mentioned that to Mary.
3620316	eng	Tom pretended he didn't hear Mary.
3620317	eng	Tom never stopped looking for Mary.
3620318	eng	Tom said he's looking for Mary.
3620319	eng	Tom took a step towards Mary.
3620320	eng	Tom doesn't want to admit how much he misses Mary.
3620321	eng	Tom said he tried to kiss Mary.
3620322	eng	Tom was extremely mad at Mary.
3620323	eng	Tom looked back and smiled at Mary.
3620324	eng	Tom pretended not to know Mary.
3620325	eng	Tom's medical expenses are being paid for by Mary.
3620326	eng	Tom made up his mind to marry Mary.
3620327	eng	I'm not sure this is necessary.
3620328	eng	Tom looks like he's going to cry.
3620329	eng	I'm trying very hard not to cry.
3620330	eng	Tom has been charged with assault and battery.
3620331	eng	Tom is still a little angry.
3620332	eng	Tom doesn't want to say anything that might make Mary angry.
3620333	eng	I'm beginning to feel a little hungry.
3620334	eng	Tom was caught trying to steal jewelry.
3620335	eng	That was a heartwarming story.
3620336	eng	It was a fascinating story.
3620337	eng	It's a very long story.
3620338	eng	I don't know what to say other than I'm sorry.
3620339	eng	I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.
3620340	eng	I'm moving across the country.
3620341	eng	I'm sure it'll be easy.
3620342	eng	I don't think it's going to be that easy.
3620343	eng	I'm afraid it's not going to be that easy.
3620344	eng	I have a feeling it's not going to be that easy.
3620345	eng	I'll go see if Tom is busy.
3620346	eng	It's a rare opportunity.
3620347	eng	I appreciate this opportunity.
3620348	eng	Tom was found not guilty.
3620349	eng	Tom asked me if I could stay and help him clean up after the party.
3620350	eng	We shouldn't have told Tom about the party.
3620351	eng	I don't think we should go to Tom's party.
3620352	eng	It's a good thing you didn't go to Tom's party.
3620353	eng	I don't think there's going to be any food left by the time we get to Tom's party.
3620354	eng	I'm fairly certain Tom isn't planning to be at Mary's party.
3620355	eng	Tom wasn't at Mary's party.
3620356	eng	Tom's the only one who wasn't at Mary's party.
3620357	eng	Tom was disappointed that Mary didn't come to his party.
3620358	eng	Tom was surprised when Mary showed up at his party.
3620359	eng	I don't think I'm going to like this party.
3620360	eng	Tom became a French teacher when he was thirty.
3620361	eng	I don't see anything here that I want to buy.
3620362	eng	I don't need to tell you how important this is, do I?
3620363	eng	Why did Tom decide to quit his job?
3620364	eng	Tom, can I see you a sec?
3620365	eng	Would you like some bread?
3620366	eng	Is Tom left-handed?

3620393	eng	Why are you in such a bad mood this evening?
3620394	eng	Do you still think Tom doesn't know what he's doing?
3620395	eng	Does Tom think he'll be able to attend the meeting?
3620396	eng	Why are you pretending you can't understand French?
3620397	eng	Why is Tom studying French?
3620398	eng	Why did Tom decide to study French?
3620399	eng	It's a little cold for a swim, don't you think?
3620400	eng	It's a little late for that, don't you think?
3620401	eng	How do you know this isn't real?
3620402	eng	How do you plan to handle this problem?
3620403	eng	Would you like some tea, Tom?

3620411	eng	Isn't that the girl who married Tom?
3620412	eng	Will you give this envelope to Tom?

3620414	eng	Shouldn't we wait for Tom?
3620415	eng	Don't you recognize that man?
3620416	eng	Do you think Tom saw Mary kissing John?

3620418	eng	How do we avoid making the same mistake again?

3636003	eng	It's been a crazy week.
3636004	eng	Tom has gone to the store to buy some milk.
3636005	eng	Here's your milk.
3636006	eng	Let's go for a drink.
3636007	eng	I'm sure I can find something for you to drink.
3636008	eng	My life's an open book.
3636009	eng	Now let's get to work.
3636010	eng	If you wanted more cake, all you had to do was ask.
3636011	eng	It's not a bad deal.
3636012	eng	This thing isn't real.
3636013	eng	It's all quite normal.
3636014	eng	It's sort of personal.
3636015	eng	It's not fair at all.
3636016	eng	I don't like this at all.
3636017	eng	It wasn't funny at all.
3636018	eng	This jacket fits pretty well.
3636019	eng	Tom was impressed by Mary's skill.
3636020	eng	Tom saw an accident on his way to school.
3636021	eng	I've got this under control.
3636022	eng	Tom is much better looking than I am.
3636023	eng	That guy still doesn't know who I am.
3636024	eng	Everyone needs a dream.
3636025	eng	Maybe I fooled them.
3636026	eng	Tom was surprised when I told him.
3636027	eng	Tom has lost the watch that Mary gave him.
3636028	eng	I already called Tom.
3636029	eng	I've already called Tom.
3636030	eng	I don't want to leave you alone with Tom.
3636031	eng	I thought something was wrong with Tom.
3636032	eng	I thought something was seriously wrong with Tom.
3636033	eng	I didn't even get to talk to Tom.
3636034	eng	I'd never do that to Tom.
3636035	eng	Tom rushed into the room.
3636036	eng	Don't leave this room.
3636037	eng	Don't let Tom into this room.
3636038	eng	Be as quick as you can.
3636039	eng	It's not a bad plan.
3636040	eng	It's an excellent plan.
3636041	eng	I'd never hit a woman.
3636042	eng	I've never hit a woman.
3636043	eng	This seat isn't taken.
3636044	eng	Keep your ears open.
3636045	eng	I always knew that one day this would happen.
3636046	eng	Tom wants to spend time with his children.
3636047	eng	The baby is crying again.
3636048	eng	It was nice to see you again.
3636049	eng	It's easy to explain.
3636050	eng	This medicine will reduce the pain.
3636051	eng	This medicine will ease the pain.
3636052	eng	It's worth the pain.
3636053	eng	I hate the rain.
3636054	eng	Don't get on this train.
3636055	eng	Tom didn't really feel that he had a chance to win.
3636056	eng	It's time to move on.
3636057	eng	The party is still going on.
3636058	eng	Tom put his cap back on.
3636059	eng	Make your own decision.
3636060	eng	Tom asked me to pick him up at the station.
3636061	eng	Tom spent a lot of time practicing the piano this afternoon.
3636062	eng	It'll be light soon.
3636063	eng	Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
3636064	eng	You're not a horrible person.
3636065	eng	Tom is in charge of making all the arrangements for our trip to Boston.
3636066	eng	This looks like fun.
3636067	eng	Now I'm having fun.
3636068	eng	It looked like a gun.
3636069	eng	Another day has begun.
3636070	eng	It's nearly dawn.
3636071	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know how to do anything on his own.
3636072	eng	My house burned down.
3636073	eng	Let me write this down.
3636074	eng	I'm headed back into town.
3636075	eng	That shouldn't be too hard to do.
3636076	eng	Tom thought it over and decided not to do what Mary asked him to do.
3636077	eng	I'm sure I can find something for you to do.
3636078	eng	Maybe I should go.
3636079	eng	I'm all packed and ready to go.
3636080	eng	I'd better go.
3636081	eng	I can't let you go.
3636082	eng	This isn't the same car I had three years ago.
3636083	eng	Tom moved here from Boston three years ago.
3636084	eng	I can do it right now if you want me to.
3636085	eng	My leg's still asleep.
3636086	eng	Mind your step.
3636087	eng	It's obvious Tom can't do it without some help.
3636088	eng	Maybe we should stop.
3636089	eng	My boys are all grown up.
3636090	eng	Come on, hurry it up.
3636091	eng	Boston is where I grew up.
3636092	eng	It looks like a bar.
3636093	eng	Tom is having second thoughts about buying your old car.
3636094	eng	Get back into your car.
3636095	eng	Get into your car.
3636096	eng	I'm sure I can find something for you to wear.
3636097	eng	That's peculiar.
3636098	eng	This place was bombed during the war.
3636099	eng	It's been a long war.
3636100	eng	You should try a little harder.
3636101	eng	Go get me another beer.
3636102	eng	Make me a better offer.
3636103	eng	Tom liked to swim when he was younger.
3636104	eng	Tom tuned Mary's guitar for her.
3636105	eng	It would've been nice if you'd gotten here earlier.
3636106	eng	Maybe I should've done this sooner.
3636107	eng	You must think I'm a complete loser.
3636108	eng	Tom will talk to us about it later.
3636109	eng	I feel like I've known you forever.
3636110	eng	I'm hung over.
3636111	eng	My shift's over.
3636112	eng	Let me think this over.
3636113	eng	My shift's almost over.
3636114	eng	My life is almost over.
3636115	eng	Get me another lawyer.
3636116	eng	Blue is my favorite color.
3636117	eng	I couldn't figure out how to open the door.
3636118	eng	I'm a private investigator.
3636119	eng	Tom is in the kitchen, standing in front of the refrigerator.
3636120	eng	We've got a visitor.
3636121	eng	It'll be dark in an hour.
3636122	eng	I missed you kids.
3636123	eng	Tom shares an apartment with three friends.
3636124	eng	It's really not as bad as it sounds.
3636125	eng	I never once doubted your abilities.
3636126	eng	Tom will be back in less than thirty minutes.
3636127	eng	I'll be there in thirty minutes.
3636128	eng	Enjoy yourselves.
3636129	eng	I've only had my driver's license for three months.
3636130	eng	Maybe I deserve this.
3636131	eng	I should probably not be doing this.
3636132	eng	Let me deal with this.
3636133	eng	I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
3636134	eng	Let's not discuss this.
3636135	eng	I don't have a good feeling about this.
3636136	eng	Tom didn't really feel like playing tennis.
3636137	eng	Don't try any tricks.
3636138	eng	See you in three weeks.
3636139	eng	It only weighs 3 kilograms.
3636140	eng	Tom said he had been asked a lot of questions.
3636141	eng	Tom said you would ask a lot of questions.
3636142	eng	Put down your weapons.
3636143	eng	The place is surrounded by cops.
3636144	eng	Look, it's hopeless.
3636145	eng	It's quite painless.
3636146	eng	My life is such a mess.
3636147	eng	Maybe you'd like to come with us.
3636148	eng	I didn't ask you to come with us.
3636149	eng	Come downtown with us.
3636150	eng	Don't try to trick us.
3636151	eng	It's over between us.
3636152	eng	It's just the two of us.
3636153	eng	Maybe you can help us.
3636154	eng	Maybe Tom can't hear us.
3636155	eng	This could be serious.
3636156	eng	It makes me curious.
3636157	eng	It makes me jealous.
3636158	eng	Now I'm nervous.
3636159	eng	It looks like a cactus.
3636160	eng	Tom didn't really feel like going out drinking with the guys.
3636161	eng	I'm sure I can find something for you to eat.
3636162	eng	Being married is great.
3636163	eng	I need a hat.
3636164	eng	I really don't understand why Tom did that.
3636165	eng	I should probably not have done that.
3636166	eng	It's older than that.
3636167	eng	I can't afford to do that.
3636168	eng	I just hope Tom doesn't know that.
3636169	eng	My mommy and daddy will love me no matter what.
3636170	eng	It was supposed to be kept secret.
3636171	eng	I'm not quite finished yet.
3636172	eng	The movie hasn't started yet.
3636173	eng	The meeting hasn't started yet.
3636174	eng	This painting isn't complete yet.
3636175	eng	The sun isn't up yet.
3636176	eng	There is no hope left.
3636177	eng	Maybe we should fight.
3636178	eng	It'll be cold tonight.
3636179	eng	There are a lot of idiots here tonight.
3636180	eng	Come on, let's see it.
3636181	eng	Let someone else handle it.
3636182	eng	Ask Tom to explain it.
3636183	eng	Maybe I should do it.
3636184	eng	Come on, let's do it.
3636185	eng	Now I'm used to it.
3636186	eng	Tom is in a lot of trouble and he knows it.
3636187	eng	OK, I think I get it.
3636188	eng	OK, I think I got it.
3636189	eng	Maybe we can fix it.
3636190	eng	Come on, let's try it.
3636191	eng	Maybe we should wait.
3636192	eng	It'll be a long wait.
3636193	eng	Maybe I should quit.
3636194	eng	It was your own fault.
3636195	eng	It's totally my fault.
3636196	eng	It was partly my fault.
3636197	eng	Tom isn't an adult.
3636198	eng	It's kind of important.
3636199	eng	Excuse me for a moment.
3636200	eng	Just relax a moment.
3636201	eng	It's your only shot.
3636202	eng	You must think I'm a complete idiot.
3636203	eng	You must've thought I was an idiot.
3636204	eng	Cigarette smoke bothers me a lot.
3636205	eng	It bothers me a lot.
3636206	eng	Maybe we should start.
3636207	eng	Baseball is my favorite sport.
3636208	eng	Tom reminded me not to forget my passport.
3636209	eng	The nurse told me that it wasn't supposed to hurt.
3636210	eng	What's past is past.
3636211	eng	It's what I do best.
3636212	eng	That's an odd request.
3636213	eng	Please hear me out.
3636214	eng	It's still dark out.
3636215	eng	Maybe I can help out.
3636216	eng	We'll work this out.
3636217	eng	I may outlive you.
3636218	eng	It's right above you.
3636219	eng	I should've been honest with you.
3636220	eng	Maybe I'll call you.
3636221	eng	It's been a while since I've seen you.
3636222	eng	I don't want anything happening to you.
3636223	eng	It's not fair to you.
3636224	eng	I'm not going to help you.
3636225	eng	Nobody can hear you.
3636226	eng	Let me do this for you.
3636227	eng	This suitcase is too heavy for you.
3636228	eng	Tom isn't as smart as you.
3636229	eng	I hardly know anything about you.
3636230	eng	I barely know anything about you.
3636231	eng	Look, I'll show you.
3636232	eng	Maybe I can show you.
3636233	eng	Roll down the window.
3636234	eng	Tom was impressed, but he tried not to let it show.
3636235	eng	I have another job now.
3636236	eng	There's no choice now.
3636237	eng	Tom is in college now.
3636238	eng	Tom is in charge now.
3636239	eng	Get me out of here now.
3636240	eng	Maybe we should go now.
3636241	eng	You should go now.
3636242	eng	I'm stronger now.
3636243	eng	You need to stop doing that right now.
3636244	eng	I can do it now.
3636245	eng	Go ahead, try it now.
3636246	eng	It'll be different now.
3636247	eng	Let's start now.
3636248	eng	Get off my property now.
3636249	eng	There's no need for you to come here tomorrow.
3636250	eng	It's such a nice day.
3636251	eng	It's been a tiring day.
3636252	eng	Have a wonderful day.
3636253	eng	It's been a stressful day.
3636254	eng	It's still my birthday.
3636255	eng	The banks are closed today.
3636256	eng	There are a lot of people here today.
3636257	eng	I wasn't born yesterday.
3636258	eng	I loved the play.
3636259	eng	Tom used a credit card to pay.
3636260	eng	I know exactly what Tom is going to say.
3636261	eng	It's easier this way.
3636262	eng	Tom said that he would be back right away.
3636263	eng	It's too late anyway.
3636264	eng	It's still not ready.
3636265	eng	Your shoes are muddy.
3636266	eng	You owe me money.
3636267	eng	Tom was kind enough to lend me some money.
3636268	eng	I'm not giving you any more money.
3636269	eng	I'm not giving you any money.
3636270	eng	Tom demanded an apology.
3636271	eng	It's still too early.
3636272	eng	Drinking warm milk makes me sleepy.
3636273	eng	Tom didn't really feel like going camping with John and Mary.
3636274	eng	I can tell that Tom doesn't believe Mary.
3636275	eng	I hope Tom doesn't go to Boston with Mary.
3636276	eng	Tom didn't really feel like playing chess with Mary.
3636277	eng	Tom took the key out of his pocket and handed it to Mary.
3636278	eng	Now I'm getting angry.
3636279	eng	Come on, let's hurry.
3636280	eng	It's useless to try.
3636281	eng	It's easy if you try.
3636282	eng	The house appears to be empty.
3636283	eng	Come back to the party.
3636284	eng	It would've been great if you could've been here for my birthday party.
3636285	eng	These boxes are heavy.
3636286	eng	Maybe I'm just crazy.
3636287	eng	I'm feeling a little dizzy.
3636288	eng	Is Tom really doing OK?
3636289	eng	Is Tom still on the job?
3636290	eng	What kind of stuff do you need?
3636291	eng	Are we almost finished?
3636292	eng	Are we nearly finished?
3636293	eng	Are you really married?
3636294	eng	Why's the door locked?
3636295	eng	Why wasn't I informed?
3636296	eng	Do you ever get scared?
3636297	eng	Have you already ordered?
3636298	eng	Why couldn't I be the one you kissed?
3636299	eng	Isn't that what I said?
3636300	eng	Is it always this cold?
3636301	eng	How did you burn your hand?
3636302	eng	What changed Tom's mind?
3636303	eng	Can I see you a second?
3636304	eng	Is that a real diamond?
3636305	eng	Did you order any food?
3636306	eng	What smells so good?
3636307	eng	Is everybody on board?
3636308	eng	Do you think I'm weird?
3636309	eng	Who called the police?
3636310	eng	How was choir practice?
3636311	eng	Is it windy outside?
3636312	eng	Do you have any coffee?
3636313	eng	What else did you see?
3636314	eng	How's your love life?
3636315	eng	How bad was the damage?
3636316	eng	What kind of mistakes did Tom make?
3636317	eng	How long did this take?
3636318	eng	What's it sound like?
3636319	eng	What's it look like?
3636320	eng	What's it smell like?
3636321	eng	What's Tom really like?
3636322	eng	Am I being unreasonable?
3636323	eng	Do I look presentable?
3636324	eng	Did you recognize any of those people?
3636325	eng	Have you betrayed me?
3636326	eng	Why did you choose me?
3636327	eng	Have you heard of me?
3636328	eng	Were you following me?
3636329	eng	Is there something else you want to tell me?
3636330	eng	Who's looking at me?
3636331	eng	Why did you betray me?
3636332	eng	What's your real name?
3636333	eng	Did you catch his name?
3636334	eng	What's his first name?
3636335	eng	Is that genuine?
3636336	eng	How soon can you get it done?
3636337	eng	How long were you gone?
3636338	eng	Do you need the phone?
3636339	eng	Could I use the phone?
3636340	eng	Who was that who answered your phone?
3636341	eng	Is there something wrong with your phone?
3636342	eng	Are you finished here?
3636343	eng	What's the real reason you're here?
3636344	eng	Did you tell Tom why you're here?
3636345	eng	When did you start working here?
3636346	eng	Do you think Tom knows what we were doing here?
3636347	eng	What are we doing here?
3636348	eng	How long will we be stuck here?
3636349	eng	Do you still work here?
3636350	eng	Why's Tom still here?
3636351	eng	How did you wind up here?
3636352	eng	Are you a teacher here?
3636353	eng	How long are we just going to sit here?
3636354	eng	Are you a student here?
3636355	eng	Who invited you here?
3636356	eng	Who else do you know here?
3636357	eng	Is everybody here?
3636358	eng	Who else is out there?
3636359	eng	Does it hurt anywhere?
3636360	eng	Are you hurt anywhere?
3636361	eng	Can I have a few minutes, please?
3636362	eng	Have you seen my purse?
3636363	eng	Can you please help me for just a minute?
3636364	eng	How soon can I leave?
3636365	eng	Could you please leave?
3636366	eng	How long does Tom have?
3636367	eng	How did you know where I live?
3636368	eng	How was the roast beef?
3636369	eng	Where's our stuff?
3636370	eng	How old is this stuff?
3636371	eng	What's Tom scared of?
3636372	eng	What's Tom afraid of?
3636373	eng	Have I missed anything?
3636374	eng	How's your kid doing?
3636375	eng	How's your boy doing?
3636376	eng	How's everything going?
3636377	eng	How are things going?
3636378	eng	How's your day going?
3636379	eng	Did you find anything interesting?
3636380	eng	Who invited Tom along?
3636381	eng	Can we hurry this along?
3636382	eng	Do you need a hug?
3636383	eng	Where's my coffee mug?
3636384	eng	Isn't that good enough?
3636385	eng	Are you in good health?
3636386	eng	How long have you been back?
3636387	eng	How about a snack?
3636388	eng	Are you really sick?
3636389	eng	Is that seriously what you think?
3636390	eng	Are you seriously ill?
3636391	eng	What are we going to do about Tom?
3636392	eng	How did you lose your arm?
3636393	eng	Do you want to go in?
3636394	eng	Is there another way in?
3636395	eng	Can't we start again?
3636396	eng	Are you ready to begin?

3665420	eng	You can clearly see what comes out when an English beginner tries to form a sentence in English. At that stage of learning the best thing for him to do is, I repeat, make sentences in Russian, translate them to English and get them fixed here if need be.
