6227416	eng	You could get Tom to do that.

6227430	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be embarrassed by that.
6227431	eng	We didn't want Tom to understand what we were talking about, so we spoke in French.
6227432	eng	Would Tom do that by himself?
6227433	eng	I can't remember the name of the girl who sat next to me in French class last year.
6227434	eng	I don't think there's any chance that Tom will ever do that.

6227443	eng	Even though I was busy, I talked to Tom for about three hours yesterday afternoon.
6227444	eng	Why would I buy that for Tom?
6227445	eng	There's a lot of difference between the way men do that and the way women do that.
6227446	eng	I didn't want to do anything that might hurt Tom's feelings.
6227447	eng	"Are you going to do that?" "Yes, I will" "How about Tom?" "No, he won't do that."
6227448	eng	Why would I be afraid of Tom?
6227449	eng	I had some free time yesterday, so I spent some time in the park with my children.
6227450	eng	I didn't want Tom to know that I didn't know how to do that.
6227451	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be outside in this kind of weather if he didn't have to be.
6227452	eng	Why is Tom afraid to do that?
6227453	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that if she doesn't want to.
6227454	eng	I didn't sharpen Tom's pencils even though he'd asked me to.
6227455	eng	I thought you said you wanted Tom to know that you really didn't want to do that.
6227456	eng	Why did you make Tom do that?
6227457	eng	Yesterday I should've done that, but since I didn't have time I gave up the idea.
6227458	eng	I didn't know where Tom wanted to spend his summer vacation.
6227459	eng	You should tell Tom that he needs to be more careful the next time he does that.
6227460	eng	Who'll go to Boston with Tom?
6227461	eng	All you have to do is just sit there and listen. You won't have to say anything.
6227462	eng	I didn't know what to do with all the junk Tom had given me.
6227463	eng	You didn't think Tom would be able to do that in less than three hours, did you?
6227464	eng	Who told Tom to go to Boston?
6227465	eng	You know better than to do that without asking for permission first, don't you?
6227466	eng	I didn't know that Tom used to be pretty good at doing that.
6227467	eng	You knew that I wasn't going to be able to convince Tom to do that, didn't you?
6227468	eng	Who gave Tom a glass of wine?
6227469	eng	I don't understand French, but I get the feeling that they're talking about me.
6227470	eng	I didn't know how to do that, so I asked Tom to show me how.
6227471	eng	You should tell Tom that he has to be more careful the next time he does that.
6227472	eng	Where did Tom go last summer?
6227473	eng	I can't do that tomorrow. Would it be OK if we did that the day after tomorrow?
6227474	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what Tom wanted me to buy.
6227475	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think I'd be able to move the piano without his help.
6227476	eng	What you said made Tom smile.
6227477	eng	Didn't you know there was a convenience store in the basement of this building?
6227478	eng	I didn't believe that Tom was capable of doing such a thing.
6227479	eng	I hope they don't find out that Tom was the one responsible for what happened.
6227480	eng	What you said made Tom laugh.
6227481	eng	After cutting down the tree, we counted the growth rings to see how old it was.
6227482	eng	I asked Tom this morning if he wanted to go jogging with me.
6227483	eng	I didn't realize that Tom didn't have enough money to buy food for his family.
6227484	eng	We should do as Tom suggests.
6227485	eng	I've never throw away anything that I thought I might be able to use sometime.
6227486	eng	How much more time do you estimate Tom will need to do that?
6227487	eng	We switched to French as soon as we realized Tom couldn't understand English.
6227488	eng	We might speak French to Tom.
6227489	eng	I don't have enough money to buy that house on Park Street that I want to buy.
6227490	eng	How many years do you think Tom has spent doing that so far?
6227491	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be here if he didn't think this meeting were important.
6227492	eng	We heard Tom speaking French.
6227493	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy the car I wanted, so I bought a cheaper one.
6227494	eng	How many weeks do you think Tom has spent doing that so far?
6227495	eng	I didn't have as much trouble convincing Tom to do that as I thought I would.
6227496	eng	We expect Tom to participate.
6227497	eng	I realized I didn't have enough time to do everything that needed to be done.
6227498	eng	How many more months do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6227499	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't need to do the same thing I needed to do.
6227500	eng	This is a pie that Tom baked.
6227501	eng	You knew I wasn't going to be able to do that without your help, didn't you?
6227502	eng	How many hours do you think Tom has spent doing that so far?
6227503	eng	I knew that Tom was a guitarist, but I'd never heard him play until tonight.
6227504	eng	The only drummer here is Tom.
6227505	eng	I was about to do that, but something came up and I didn't have a chance to.
6227506	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
6227507	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he didn't need to do that?
6227508	eng	Tell Tom to do that tomorrow.
6227509	eng	Did you know there was a convenience store in the basement of this building?
6227510	eng	Didn't you know Tom was the one who was supposed to do that?
6227511	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he didn't have to do that?
6227512	eng	Tell Tom not to do that here.
6227513	eng	You didn't know that you were the one who was supposed to do that, did you?
6227514	eng	You tried to convince Tom not to do that again, didn't you?
6227515	eng	If I had known that Tom didn't know how to do that, I'd have shown him how.
6227516	eng	Tell Tom he ought to do that.
6227517	eng	The food at that restaurant wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.
6227518	eng	You should probably tell Tom why you don't want to do that.
6227519	eng	I thought you said you wanted to know who Tom was planning to do that with.
6227520	eng	Tell Tom he needs to do that.
6227521	eng	Filling out this questionnaire should only take a few minutes of your time.
6227522	eng	You seemed to be surprised that Tom wasn't able to do that.
6227523	eng	You didn't seem to be surprised when Tom told you that you had to do that.
6227524	eng	Please tell Tom not to leave.
6227525	eng	"Do I have to do that?" "You don't have to, but it'd be better if you did."
6227526	eng	You hope that Tom will teach you how to do that, don't you?
6227527	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he wouldn't be allowed to do that?
6227528	eng	Perhaps Tom can speak French.
6227529	eng	If we'd arrived a few minutes earlier, we could've found somewhere to sit.
6227530	eng	You haven't yet told Tom why you need to do that, have you?
6227531	eng	I didn't think that what Tom was wearing was appropriate for the occasion.
6227532	eng	Maybe Tom will come tomorrow.
6227533	eng	I've asked many people the same question and I always get the same answer.
6227534	eng	You don't really care whether Tom likes you or not, do you?
6227535	eng	Did you know that Tom wrote his first song when he was thirteen years old?
6227536	eng	Maybe Tom is in the hospital.
6227537	eng	I won't be able to do that by myself, so I need to ask someone to help me.
6227538	eng	You don't know whether Tom needs to do that or not, do you?
6227539	eng	You didn't know what to do when Tom refused to help you do that, did you?
6227540	eng	Let Tom do whatever he wants.
6227541	eng	I realize I don't have enough time to do everything that needs to be done.
6227542	eng	You didn't tell Tom why you wanted him to do that, did you?
6227543	eng	What Tom said was true at the time he said it, but it isn't true anymore.
6227544	eng	Let Tom do anything he wants.
6227545	eng	You weren't able to get everything done that needed to be done, were you?
6227546	eng	You didn't seem to understand why Tom wanted me to do that.
6227547	eng	Just make sure you tell Tom what time he's supposed to be there tomorrow.
6227548	eng	It's way past Tom's bed time.
6227549	eng	That's the woman whose son was arrested yesterday in front of the school.
6227550	eng	You didn't seem to be convinced that Tom wanted to do that.
6227551	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
6227552	eng	It's good that Tom does that.
6227553	eng	If there's a typhoon tomorrow, does that mean I don't have to go to work?
6227554	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom had already done that.
6227555	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me where he'd spent the summer vacation.
6227556	eng	It won't be easy to beat Tom.
6227557	eng	I'd like to figure out how to deal with this problem as soon as possible.
6227558	eng	You didn't really think Tom would like doing that, did you?
6227559	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't have to do the same thing I had to do.
6227560	eng	It was lucky Tom didn't do that.
6227561	eng	I wasn't surprised that I didn't have to do the same thing you had to do.
6227562	eng	You didn't really think Tom would have to do that, did you?
6227563	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't need to do the same thing I needed to do.
6227564	eng	It took Tom weeks to do that.
6227565	eng	I knew I didn't have enough time to do everything that needed to be done.
6227566	eng	You didn't know that Tom was the one who did that, did you?
6227567	eng	I thought Tom would be interested in the exhibit at the museum this week.
6227568	eng	It looks like Tom is unhappy.
6227569	eng	I don't let my children watch TV until after they've done their homework.
6227570	eng	You didn't know Tom was supposed to do that today, did you?
6227571	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be absent if he knew how important this meeting was.
6227572	eng	Is it true that Tom did that?
6227573	eng	You didn't know that I was the one who was supposed to do that, did you?
6227574	eng	What makes you think Tom would be interested in doing that?
6227575	eng	You told Tom I didn't want to wait until October to do that, didn't you?
6227576	eng	Is Tom going to sing tonight?
6227577	vie	Cô ấy đang tiến bộ.
6227578	eng	My shirt was soaked with sweat, so I took it off and put on another one.
6227579	eng	We didn't know whether Tom would want to go with us or not.
6227580	eng	You should probably tell Tom that he should do that as soon as possible.
6227581	eng	Is Tom determined to do that?
6227582	eng	I'm not surprised that I don't have to do the same thing you have to do.
6227583	eng	The last time I saw Tom he was feeding pigeons in the park.
6227584	eng	You didn't know that Tom wasn't supposed to do that by himself, did you?
6227586	eng	I was going to do that the day before yesterday, but I didn't have time.
6227587	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom didn't want to do that.
6227588	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to pick the children up at school today.
6227589	eng	I've never met Tom's parents.
6227590	eng	I should've done that yesterday, but since I didn't have time, I didn't.
6227591	eng	It's up to you to decide whether or not Tom has to do that.
6227592	eng	No matter how carefully I explain things, Tom never seems to understand.
6227593	eng	I'm tired of waiting for Tom.
6227594	eng	I didn't know whether I should stay a little longer or leave right away.
6227595	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if Tom stayed in Boston all winter.
6227596	eng	If Tom had been a friend of mine, I would've advised him not to do that.
6227597	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be scared.
6227598	eng	You didn't know that we were supposed to do that by ourselves, did you?
6227599	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't want to do that with us.
6227600	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think you'd be able to do that without my help.
6227601	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be lonely.
6227602	eng	The young boy playing the banjo in front of the train station was good.
6227603	eng	I want to make sure we don't make the same mistake Tom did.
6227604	eng	I thought you said you wanted to know who Tom was going to do that with.
6227605	eng	I'm sure Tom will be thirsty.
6227606	eng	Thank you very much for the suggestion. I'll definitely think about it.
6227607	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that without our help.
6227608	eng	I think Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
6227609	eng	I'm sure Tom will be pleased.
6227610	eng	I wouldn't have asked you to do that if I didn't think you could do it.
6227611	eng	I thought Tom might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6227612	eng	I suppose since Tom doesn't have any money, he won't be able to do that.
6227613	eng	I'm sure Tom will be nervous.
6227614	eng	I was surprised that I didn't have to do the same things you had to do.
6227615	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be ready if you got there before 2:30.
6227616	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you that you didn't need to do that.
6227617	eng	I'm sure Tom will be jealous.
6227618	eng	I tried speaking French to them, but they didn't seem to understand me.
6227619	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I don't want him to do that.
6227620	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you that you didn't have to do that.
6227621	eng	I'm sure Tom will be curious.
6227622	eng	I thought you said you wanted to know who was going to help me do that.
6227623	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be tomorrow afternoon.
6227624	eng	You knew that Tom told everyone he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6227625	eng	I'm sure Tom will be careful.
6227626	eng	I spent a couple of hours sitting on a bench in the park feeding birds.
6227627	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be through doing that.
6227628	eng	You knew Tom wouldn't be able to do that without your help, didn't you?
6227629	eng	I'm sure Tom will be annoyed.
6227630	eng	I know I don't have enough time to do everything that needs to be done.
6227631	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be tempted to do that.
6227632	eng	There's no reason Tom needs to know how much you bought your house for.
6227633	eng	I'm positive Tom can do that.
6227634	eng	I hope you remember that tomorrow is the day we're supposed to do that.
6227635	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be frightened by that.
6227636	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think I'd be able to do that without his help.
6227637	eng	I'm not sure what Tom bought.
6227638	eng	I didn't do well enough on the driver's test to get a driver's license.
6227639	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
6227640	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
6227641	eng	I'm glad Tom is here to help.
6227642	eng	You weren't able to get everything done that had to be done, were you?
6227643	eng	I don't want to do anything that might hurt Tom's feelings.
6227644	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6227645	eng	I'll stay in Boston with Tom.
6227646	eng	If you had asked for my advice, I would've advised you not to do that.
6227647	eng	I don't think Tom would be doing that if he didn't want to.
6227648	eng	I thought I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say.
6227649	eng	I'll help Tom clean his room.
6227650	eng	I was surprised that I didn't have to do the same thing you had to do.
6227651	eng	I don't think Tom would be doing that if he didn't need to.
6227652	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be so grouchy all the time if he'd get more sleep.
6227654	eng	I don't want to wear the shirt that my mother gave me for my birthday.
6227655	eng	I don't think Tom would be doing that if he didn't have to.
6227656	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be forgiven for doing that if he weren't so young.
6227658	eng	I didn't know that I was supposed to do that the day before yesterday.
6227659	eng	I don't think Tom will likely be able to do that very well.
6227660	eng	I think Tom would like to be finished doing that before Monday evening.
6227661	eng	I wonder if Tom will do that.
6227662	eng	How often does your mother have you go to the supermarket to buy bread?
6227663	eng	I don't think Tom will be glad that that's going to happen.
6227664	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that.
6227665	eng	I wonder if Tom will be late.
6227666	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that by herself.
6227667	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so difficult to get along with.
6227668	eng	I didn't feel like explaining why I didn't want to go camping with Tom.
6227669	eng	I wonder if Tom is unmarried.
6227670	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that by herself.
6227671	eng	I didn't think Tom was interested in learning how to drive.
6227672	eng	I became sleepy while listening to Tom telling a story to the children.
6227673	eng	I wonder if Tom is skeptical.
6227674	eng	You didn't know you weren't supposed to do that by yourself, did you?
6227675	eng	I didn't think I'd ever be able to convince Tom to do that.
6227676	eng	Even though Tom and I go to the same school, I don't see him every day.
6227677	eng	I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
6227678	eng	You didn't know we weren't supposed to do that this morning, did you?
6227679	eng	I didn't tell Tom about the job I'd been offered in Boston.
6227680	eng	You knew that Tom was very unlikely to be able to do that, didn't you?
6227681	eng	I wonder if Tom is irritated.
6227682	eng	You didn't know we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves, did you?
6227683	eng	I didn't read any of the messages Tom sent to me yesterday.
6227684	eng	You knew Tom wouldn't be able to do that without any help, didn't you?
6227685	eng	I wonder if Tom is incorrect.
6227686	eng	When I was young, all the kids in the neighborhood used to fly kites.
6227687	eng	I didn't know who Tom wanted to give the bottle of wine to.
6227688	eng	You knew Tom was probably not going to be able to do that, didn't you?
6227689	eng	I wonder if Tom is in Boston.
6227690	eng	This morning's meeting was more interesting than I expected it to be.
6227691	eng	I didn't know where I could buy a ticket for Tom's concert.
6227692	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you he didn't want to do that.
6227693	eng	I wonder if Tom is impressed.
6227694	eng	If you have time this afternoon, why don't you come over for a while?
6227695	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom said he wouldn't help me.
6227696	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you he didn't need to do that.
6227697	eng	I wonder if Tom is exhausted.
6227698	eng	I'd rather wear a T-shirt that's too large than one that's too small.
6227699	eng	I didn't know exactly what it was that Tom wanted me to do.
6227700	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you he didn't have to do that.
6227701	eng	I wonder if Tom is depressed.
6227702	eng	I wouldn't have asked you for help if I could've done that by myself.
6227703	eng	I didn't know Tom and you used to be married to each other.
6227704	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he shouldn't do that?
6227705	eng	I wonder if Tom is dedicated.
6227706	eng	I wouldn't be outside in this kind of weather if I didn't have to be.
6227707	eng	I didn't have the time to do everything Tom asked me to do.
6227708	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he needed to do that?
6227709	eng	I wonder if Tom is dangerous.
6227710	eng	I would've told you this before, but I didn't think you'd understand.
6227711	eng	I didn't expect Tom to be able to play the bassoon so well.
6227712	eng	The old woman sitting in the passenger seat of Tom's car seemed crazy.
6227713	eng	I wonder if Tom is confident.
6227714	eng	I thought you'd be interested in the exhibit at the museum next week.
6227715	eng	How many more years do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6227716	eng	Probably the reason Tom can't go is because he doesn't have any money.
6227717	eng	I won't force Tom to do that.
6227718	eng	I didn't want to get into the water until the lifeguard went on duty.
6227719	eng	How many more weeks do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6227720	eng	If Tom had asked for my advice, I would've advised him not to do that.
6227721	eng	I wasn't the one who hit Tom.
6227722	eng	I didn't know I didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done.
6227723	eng	How many more months will it take Tom to finish doing that?
6227724	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be confused if you'd explained it to him better.
6227725	eng	I wasn't allowed to help Tom.
6227726	eng	I didn't buy anything at that store because the prices were too high.
6227727	eng	How many more months do you think Tom will want to do that?
6227728	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be back soon. He said he'd be gone for a long time.
6227729	eng	I wasn't able to talk to Tom.
6227730	eng	I asked Mary is she wanted to go to a party with me and she said yes.
6227731	eng	How many more months do you think Tom will need to do that?
6227732	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't have to do the same thing I had to do.
6227733	eng	I wasn't able to protect Tom.
6227734	eng	How many more years do you think it'll you take to finish doing that?
6227735	eng	How many more months do you think Tom will have to do that?
6227736	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be so grumpy all the time if he'd get more sleep.
6227737	eng	I was on the same bus as Tom.
6227738	eng	How many more years do you think it'll take you to finish doing that?
6227739	eng	How many more hours do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6227740	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be exhausted all the time if he'd get more sleep.
6227741	eng	I wanted to help Tom do that.
6227742	eng	Didn't you know there used to be a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
6227743	eng	How many minutes do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6227744	eng	I should probably tell Tom that he should do that as soon as possible.
6227745	eng	I wanted Tom to study French.
6227746	eng	You used to do that when you were in junior high school, didn't you?
6227747	eng	How many days do you think Tom has spent doing that so far?
6227748	eng	I knew Tom would have to stay in Boston longer than he had planned to.
6227749	eng	I want to tell Tom the truth.
6227750	eng	You knew I was probably not going to be able to do that, didn't you?
6227751	eng	Didn't you know that Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
6227752	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
6227753	eng	I want to play golf with Tom.
6227754	eng	We'll be in Boston for three more days and then we'll go to Chicago.
6227755	eng	Didn't you know Tom and I used to be married to each other?
6227756	eng	I didn't think Tom would be at home, but I knocked on his door anyway.
6227757	eng	I want to meet Tom's parents.
6227758	eng	There are several reasons why it wouldn't be a good idea to do that.
6227759	eng	You told Tom I didn't have to do that anymore, didn't you?
6227760	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you're not going to do that, have you?
6227761	eng	I want Tom to do that for us.
6227762	eng	The food at that restaurant wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
6227763	eng	You should've told Tom that he wasn't supposed to do that.
6227764	eng	You should probably tell Tom that you can't do that without his help.
6227765	eng	I want Tom to do that for me.
6227766	eng	I'm surprised that I don't have to do the same thing you have to do.
6227767	eng	You should probably tell Tom that you want him to do that.
6227768	eng	You should at least tell Tom that he doesn't need to do that anymore.
6227769	eng	I told Tom what I want to do.
6227770	eng	I'll never be able to afford to buy the kind of house my wife wants.
6227771	eng	You should probably not tell Tom that you want to do that.
6227772	eng	You should at least tell Tom that he doesn't have to do that anymore.
6227773	eng	I told Tom I never said that.
6227774	eng	I don't want to get into the water until the lifeguard goes on duty.
6227775	eng	You ought to tell Tom that you don't feel like doing that.
6227776	eng	You didn't think Tom could do that in less than three hours, did you?
6227777	eng	I thought Tom would be tired.
6227778	eng	I didn't want to admit that I was the one who had broken the window.
6227779	eng	You never told Tom about what I did that weekend, did you?
6227780	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you Tom didn't want to do that.
6227781	eng	I thought Tom would be first.
6227782	eng	How much more time do you estimate you'll need to finish doing that?
6227783	eng	You know that Tom is still planning to do that, don't you?
6227784	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you Tom didn't need to do that.
6227785	eng	I thought Tom would be early.
6227786	eng	You know there's no way I can do that without some help, don't you?
6227787	eng	You know it wasn't the first time Tom did that, don't you?
6227788	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you Tom didn't have to do that.
6227789	eng	I thought Tom would be alone.
6227790	eng	You knew I might not be permitted to do that by myself, didn't you?
6227791	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't be able to do that, didn't you?
6227792	eng	You didn't know whether Tom would be able to do that or not, did you?
6227793	eng	I thought Tom wasn't worried.
6227794	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you I didn't want to do that.
6227795	eng	You didn't tell Tom why you wanted me to do that, did you?
6227796	eng	You didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that by himself, did you?
6227797	eng	I thought Tom wasn't at home.
6227798	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you I didn't need to do that.
6227799	eng	You didn't really think Tom would let me do that, did you?
6227800	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he ought to do that?
6227801	eng	I thought Tom was suspicious.
6227802	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you I didn't have to do that.
6227803	eng	You didn't know that Tom wasn't going to do that, did you?
6227804	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he needs to do that?
6227805	eng	I thought Tom was interested.
6227806	eng	You did know I was the one who was supposed to do that, didn't you?
6227807	eng	You didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that, did you?
6227808	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom about what happened?
6227809	eng	I thought Tom was frightened.
6227810	eng	It's going to be very tough for me to do that if you don't help me.
6227811	eng	You didn't know Tom wanted to do that by himself, did you?
6227812	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who doesn't want to do that.
6227813	eng	I thought Tom was downstairs.
6227814	eng	I'm glad I didn't have to live in Boston for more than three years.
6227815	eng	You didn't know Tom needed to do that by himself, did you?
6227816	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who doesn't need to do that.
6227817	eng	I thought Tom should do that.
6227818	eng	I know I'm supposed to pay my rent on the first day of every month.
6227819	eng	You and I both know what'll happen if Tom doesn't do that.
6227820	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who doesn't have to do that.
6227821	eng	I thought Tom seemed shocked.
6227822	eng	I doubt seriously if I'll ever study French again after I graduate.
6227823	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you don't want to do that?
6227824	eng	I think Tom would like to be outside playing with the other children.
6227825	eng	I thought Tom seemed excited.
6227826	eng	I don't go fishing very much anymore, but I used to go quite often.
6227827	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you don't need to do that?
6227828	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to do that in less than three hours.
6227829	eng	I thought Tom looked shocked.
6227830	eng	I didn't come to school yesterday because I had to go to a funeral.
6227831	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you don't have to do that?
6227832	eng	I didn't know whether Tom would be able to do that by himself or not.
6227833	eng	I thought Tom looked nervous.
6227834	eng	I could stay in Boston for another week or two if you need me here.
6227835	eng	We'll stay in Boston until Tom graduates from high school.
6227836	eng	Don't forget to tell Tom what time he's supposed to be here tomorrow.
6227837	eng	I think you've convinced Tom.
6227838	eng	Even if I wanted to do that, I don't think my parents would let me.
6227839	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he should do that?
6227840	eng	Didn't you know Tom wanted to stay in Boston for another three weeks?
6227841	eng	I think helped Tom out a lot.
6227843	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he has to do that?
6227844	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to live in a small apartment on Park Street?
6227845	eng	I think Tom would be nervous.
6227846	eng	Do you remember the title of that movie we saw together last month?
6227847	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he had to do that?
6227848	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you didn't want to do that, have you?
6227849	eng	I think Tom would be jealous.
6227850	eng	Boston is a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there.
6227851	eng	Was it you who told Tom he wouldn't be allowed to do that?
6227852	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you didn't need to do that, have you?
6227853	eng	I think Tom would be curious.
6227854	eng	About how many French restaurants do you think there are in Boston?
6227855	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about that.
6227856	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you didn't have to do that, have you?
6227857	eng	I think Tom won't be worried.
6227858	eng	You knew I wouldn't be permitted to do that by myself, didn't you?
6227859	eng	There's no reason Tom needs to know why I want to do that.
6227860	eng	You should probably not tell Tom that you don't know how to do that.
6227861	eng	I think Tom won't be nervous.
6227862	eng	You didn't know you were supposed to do that by yourself, did you?
6227863	eng	The only one here who doesn't feel like doing that is Tom.
6227864	eng	You should at least tell Tom that you don't want to do that anymore.
6227865	eng	I think Tom won't be jealous.
6227866	eng	You didn't know we were supposed to do that this morning, did you?
6227867	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that now isn't the time to do that.
6227868	eng	You should at least tell Tom that you don't need to do that anymore.
6227869	eng	I think Tom will be truthful.
6227870	eng	You didn't know we were supposed to do that by ourselves, did you?
6227871	eng	Is it true that you and Tom are staying in the same hotel?
6227872	eng	You should at least tell Tom that you don't have to do that anymore.
6227873	eng	I think Tom will be stubborn.
6227874	eng	You didn't know that I was supposed to do that yesterday, did you?
6227875	eng	If I'd been there, I wouldn't have allowed Tom to do that.
6227876	eng	You knew that Tom told everyone he was going to do that, didn't you?
6227877	eng	I think Tom will be punctual.
6227878	eng	You didn't know that I was supposed to do that by myself, did you?
6227879	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be bored. He enjoys this kind of thing.
6227880	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you that you had to do that.
6227881	eng	I think Tom will be obedient.
6227882	eng	You can come to Boston and stay with me all winter if you want to.
6227883	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
6227884	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told me I didn't need to do that.
6227885	eng	I think Tom will be confused.
6227886	eng	We have a post in the middle of our yard that we chain our dog to.
6227887	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me why we should do that.
6227888	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told me I didn't have to do that.
6227889	eng	I think Tom will be careless.
6227890	eng	The last time I saw Mary she was holding a doll in her right hand.
6227891	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me why we had to do that.
6227892	eng	You could at least tell Tom that he doesn't have to do that anymore.
6227893	eng	I think Tom wants to do that.
6227894	eng	Someone threw a snowball at the policeman and he started shooting.
6227895	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me why he wanted to do that.
6227896	eng	If Tom had been a friend of mine, I would've advised him to do that.
6227897	eng	I think Tom ought to do that.
6227898	eng	It took me a little longer than it usually does to get here today.
6227899	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me why he needed to do that.
6227900	eng	I wish I hadn't spent so much money on the present I bought for Tom.
6227901	eng	I think Tom needs to do that.
6227902	eng	It probably wouldn't have been interesting to do that by yourself.
6227903	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me I didn't have to do that.
6227904	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me where the party was going to be.
6227905	eng	I think Tom missed the train.
6227906	eng	If you had asked for my advice, I would've advised you to do that.
6227907	eng	I wanted Tom to do that, but he told me he wouldn't do it.
6227908	eng	I told Tom that I wouldn't stay in Boston for more than three weeks.
6227909	eng	I think Tom might be nervous.
6227910	eng	I've been coming to Boston every summer for the past thirty years.
6227911	eng	I thought Tom would be able to do what we asked him to do.
6227912	eng	I told Tom that I wanted to go to Boston, but I didn't tell him why.
6227913	eng	I think Tom might be jealous.
6227914	eng	I'll be in Boston for three more days and then I'll go to Chicago.
6227915	eng	I thought Tom was finished, but he told me that he wasn't.
6227916	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think you'd be able to do that by yourself.
6227917	eng	I think Tom may speak French.
6227918	eng	I wouldn't have asked you to do that if I could've done it myself.
6227919	eng	I thought Tom said he didn't know how to play the ukulele.
6227920	eng	I thought you said you wanted to tell Tom that he shouldn't do that.
6227921	eng	I think Tom is uncomfortable.
6227922	eng	I realized I didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done.
6227923	eng	I think Tom wouldn't still be awake at this time of night.
6227924	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't want to do that.
6227925	eng	I think Tom hasn't done that.
6227926	eng	I had to stay in the hospital for three weeks after the operation.
6227927	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be interested in something like that.
6227928	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be grouchy all the time if he'd get more sleep.
6227929	eng	I think Tom can speak French.
6227930	eng	I don't like being the one who always has to take out the garbage.
6227931	eng	I think Tom would be lonely if he went camping by himself.
6227932	eng	I think Tom probably isn't as good at doing that as you think he is.
6227933	eng	I think I'll do that for Tom.
6227934	eng	I don't know whether I can do that or not, but I'll give it a try.
6227935	eng	I think Tom will be awake by the time breakfast is served.
6227936	eng	I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but I wanted him to do it anyway.
6227937	eng	I still haven't answered Tom.
6227938	eng	I didn't sign the confession they were trying to force me to sign.
6227939	eng	I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
6227940	eng	I knew I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say.
6227941	eng	I shouldn't have married Tom.
6227942	eng	I didn't have enough time to answer all the questions on the test.
6227943	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I know how to do that.
6227944	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be finished doing that by 2:30.
6227945	eng	I should tell Tom what to do.
6227946	eng	I didn't have as much trouble getting a loan as I thought I would.
6227947	eng	I know I don't have to do anything Tom has asked me to do.
6227948	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be difficult to get along with.
6227949	eng	I should tell Tom to do that.
6227950	eng	I didn't have as much trouble falling asleep as I thought I would.
6227951	eng	I just told Tom that he doesn't have to help me on Monday.
6227952	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be awake at this time of night.
6227953	eng	I should tell Tom I'm sleepy.
6227954	eng	How many more months do you think it'll take to finish doing that?
6227955	eng	I hope you told Tom that I was the one who had to do that.
6227956	eng	I don't think Tom would be foolish enough to do something like that.
6227957	eng	I scolded Tom for doing that.
6227958	eng	How many more days do you think it'll take to finish this project?
6227959	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be back anytime soon.
6227960	eng	I don't think Tom is the kind of person who'd do that kind of thing.
6227961	eng	I needed to help Tom do that.
6227962	eng	Did you know there used to be a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
6227963	eng	I don't think Tom really had to do that yesterday morning.
6227964	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what Tom wanted me to buy for him.
6227965	eng	I need to tell Tom the truth.
6227966	eng	Could you check to see if there are any mistakes in this document?
6227967	eng	I don't think Tom is the type of person who would do that.
6227968	eng	I couldn't go to Boston with Tom because I didn't have enough money.
6227969	eng	I need to talk to Tom myself.
6227970	eng	You're the only person I know who's likely to be able to do that.
6227971	eng	I don't know who Tom wants to give this bottle of wine to.
6227972	eng	You've given up trying to persuade Tom not to do that, haven't you?
6227973	eng	I like the way Tom does that.
6227974	eng	You're the only person I know who doesn't like watching football.
6227975	eng	I don't know where Tom wants to spend his summer vacation.
6227976	eng	You've given up trying to convince Tom not to do that, haven't you?
6227977	eng	I know why Tom is suspicious.
6227978	eng	You knew I might not be allowed to do that by myself, didn't you?
6227979	eng	I don't know Tom well enough to ask him to do that for me.
6227980	eng	You've finally managed to persuade Tom not to do that, haven't you?
6227981	eng	I know why Tom can't do that.
6227982	eng	You didn't realize I wasn't going to be able to do that, did you?
6227983	eng	I don't have to tell Tom how to do that. He already knows.
6227984	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you don't want to do that, have you?
6227985	eng	I know what Tom needs to buy.
6227986	eng	There are several reasons why it would be a good idea to do that.
6227987	eng	I didn't wake Tom up and he slept for another three hours.
6227988	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you don't need to do that, have you?
6227989	eng	I know the man Tom came with.
6227990	eng	Please make sure that you do that at least once every three days.
6227991	eng	I didn't think Tom would be gone by the time we got there.
6227992	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you don't have to do that, have you?
6227993	eng	I know that Tom was offended.
6227994	eng	It looks it might start raining, so you'd better not do that now.
6227995	eng	I didn't tell Tom I wasn't planning on being at his party.
6227996	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't be interested in doing that, didn't you?
6227997	eng	I know that Tom is unmarried.
6227998	eng	If you'd been a little more careful, this wouldn't have happened.
6227999	eng	I didn't realize Tom shouldn't be doing what he was doing.
6228000	eng	You didn't realize Tom wasn't going to be able to do that, did you?
6228001	eng	I know that Tom is terrified.
6228002	eng	I've put on a lot of weight, so I can't wear these jeans anymore.
6228003	eng	I didn't know whether Tom would come by car or by bicycle.
6228004	eng	You didn't know whether Tom was good at doing that or not, did you?
6228005	eng	I know that Tom is skeptical.
6228006	eng	I was wondering if you'd like to go out and get something to eat.
6228007	eng	I didn't know whether Tom would be able to do that or not.
6228008	eng	You didn't know Tom wasn't supposed to do that by himself, did you?
6228009	eng	I know that Tom is satisfied.
6228010	eng	I realized I didn't have enough money to buy everything I wanted.
6228011	eng	I didn't know where Tom was going for his summer vacation.
6228012	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he should do that?
6228013	eng	I know that Tom is reputable.
6228014	eng	I realized I didn't have enough money to buy everything I needed.
6228015	eng	I didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
6228016	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he has to do that?
6228017	eng	I know that Tom is plastered.
6228018	eng	I didn't think I would be able to pass the test without cheating.
6228019	eng	I didn't know that Tom had intended to be there yesterday.
6228020	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom he had to do that?
6228021	eng	I know that Tom is perplexed.
6228022	eng	I didn't know how to do that, but I was willing to give it a try.
6228023	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to have to do that on his own.
6228024	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he doesn't have to do that?
6228025	eng	I know that Tom is paralyzed.
6228026	eng	I didn't have as much trouble finding a job as I thought I would.
6228027	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to have to do that by himself.
6228028	eng	Just make sure you tell Tom what time the meeting's going to start.
6228029	eng	I know that Tom is obstinate.
6228030	eng	How many professional musicians do you think there are in Boston?
6228031	eng	I didn't ask Tom who he was planning to go to Boston with.
6228032	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be the one responsible for doing that.
6228033	eng	I know that Tom is observant.
6228034	eng	How many more years do you think it'll take to finish doing that?
6228035	eng	How much more time do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6228036	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom would refuse to do that.
6228037	eng	I know that Tom is obnoxious.
6228038	eng	How many more weeks do you think it'll take to finish doing that?
6228039	eng	How many more years will it take Tom to finish doing that?
6228040	eng	I think Tom would likely do that for you if you asked him politely.
6228041	eng	I know that Tom is motivated.
6228042	eng	How many more hours do you think it'll take to finish doing that?
6228043	eng	How many more years do you think Tom will want to do that?
6228044	eng	I really should've told Tom not to stay in Boston for another week.
6228045	eng	I know that Tom is irritated.
6228046	eng	Do you mean that you didn't know Mozart wrote a bassoon concerto?
6228047	eng	How many more years do you think Tom will need to do that?
6228048	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be present at today's meeting.
6228049	eng	I know that Tom is intrigued.
6228050	eng	You should do that as often as you can while you're still young.
6228051	eng	How many more years do you think Tom will have to do that?
6228052	eng	I don't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
6228053	eng	I know that Tom is incorrect.
6228054	eng	You seem to be unconvinced that doing that would be a good idea.
6228055	eng	How many more weeks will it take Tom to finish doing that?
6228056	eng	I didn't talk Tom into doing anything he didn't already want to do.
6228057	eng	I know that Tom is in Boston.
6228058	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you why we should do that.
6228059	eng	How many more weeks do you think Tom will want to do that?
6228060	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom said he wouldn't help me do that.
6228061	eng	I know that Tom is impressed.
6228062	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you why we had to do that.
6228063	eng	How many more weeks do you think Tom will need to do that?
6228064	eng	I didn't know how to ask Tom to leave without hurting his feelings.
6228065	eng	I know that Tom is impatient.
6228066	eng	You didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that by myself, did you?
6228067	eng	How many more weeks do you think Tom will have to do that?
6228068	eng	I didn't have a chance to visit Tom that last time I was in Boston.
6228069	eng	I know that Tom is exhausted.
6228070	eng	We didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
6228071	eng	How many more hours will it take Tom to finish doing that?
6228072	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will need stay in the hospital?
6228073	eng	I know that Tom is dishonest.
6228074	eng	The most important thing for you to do now is to get some sleep.
6228075	eng	How many more hours do you think Tom will want to do that?
6228076	eng	Even though I was busy I talked with Tom for three hours yesterday.
6228077	eng	I know that Tom is different.
6228078	eng	My wife called to let me know she wasn't cooking dinner tonight.
6228079	eng	How many more hours do you think Tom will need to do that?
6228080	eng	Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning to attend today's meeting?
6228081	eng	I know that Tom is desperate.
6228082	eng	It probably wouldn't have been dangerous to do that by yourself.
6228083	eng	How many more hours do you think Tom will have to do that?
6228084	eng	You told Tom I thought he wouldn't be able to do that, didn't you?
6228085	eng	I know that Tom is depressed.
6228086	eng	I'd like to do that as often as I can while it's still possible.
6228087	eng	How many more days do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6228088	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you that you needed to do that.
6228089	eng	I know that Tom is dangerous.
6228090	eng	I wanted to do something that would make my parents proud of me.
6228091	eng	How many months do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6228092	eng	You knew Tom was going to be mad at me for doing that, didn't you?
6228093	eng	I know that Tom is courteous.
6228094	eng	I thought you said you didn't to know how to play the harmonica.
6228095	eng	Do you think Tom would still be willing to do that for us?
6228096	eng	You knew Tom told everyone he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6228097	eng	I know that Tom is confident.
6228098	eng	I thought I should say something, but I didn't know what to say.
6228099	eng	Didn't you know that Tom saw you in the park this morning?
6228100	eng	You didn't think Tom would be able to do that by himself, did you?
6228101	eng	I know that Tom is concerned.
6228102	eng	I know I won't be able to do that, so I'm not even going to try.
6228103	eng	You're probably the only person who can help Tom do that.
6228104	eng	You didn't know that Tom was supposed to help me do that, did you?
6228105	eng	I know that Tom is conceited.
6228106	eng	I knew I needed to say something, but I didn't know what to say.
6228107	eng	You'd be very disappointed if Tom did that, wouldn't you?
6228108	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he didn't need to do that?
6228109	eng	I know that Tom is ambitious.
6228110	eng	I just found out that you're going to be given an award tonight.
6228111	eng	You weren't the one who advised Tom to do that, were you?
6228112	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he didn't have to do that?
6228113	eng	I know quite a lot about Tom.
6228114	eng	I didn't want any of my friends to know that I couldn't do that.
6228115	eng	You tried to convince Tom to quit doing that, didn't you?
6228116	eng	If Tom had asked for my advice, I would've advised him to do that.
6228117	eng	I know how to make Tom smile.
6228118	eng	I didn't think you were going to be able to do that by yourself.
6228119	eng	You tried to convince Tom to do that for you, didn't you?
6228120	eng	I'm probably the only person here who knows how old Tom really is.
6228121	eng	I know how to make Tom happy.
6228122	eng	I didn't know that you were the one who was supposed to do that.
6228123	eng	You still don't know the reason why Tom did that, do you?
6228124	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who knows how to do that.
6228125	eng	I know Tom wanted to do that.
6228126	eng	I could've visited Boston, but decided to go to Chicago instead.
6228127	eng	You should probably tell Tom you don't intend to do that.
6228128	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me where the picnic was going to be.
6228129	eng	I know Tom shouldn't do that.
6228130	eng	I can't remember the name of the girl I met last week in Boston.
6228131	eng	You should probably not tell Tom you're going to do that.
6228132	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me he'd spent three years in prison.
6228133	eng	I know Tom shouldn't be here.
6228134	eng	I can't go to Boston with you because I don't have enough money.
6228135	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you he had to do that.
6228136	eng	I think Tom is probably better at doing that than you think he is.
6228137	eng	I know Tom isn't that stupid.
6228138	eng	How many more days do you think it'll take to finish doing that?
6228139	eng	You know that Tom wasn't the one who did that, don't you?
6228140	eng	I promised Tom I wouldn't stay in Boston for more than three days.
6228141	eng	I know Tom is doing that now.
6228142	eng	You should come stay with us for a couple of weeks next summer.
6228143	eng	You know that Tom doesn't know how to do that, don't you?
6228144	eng	I hope you told Tom I didn't want to wait until Monday to do that.
6228145	eng	I know Tom has been arrested.
6228146	eng	You knew that I wasn't going to be able to do that, didn't you?
6228147	eng	You know I'm not supposed to help Tom do that, don't you?
6228148	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be amused by what's going on.
6228149	eng	I hoped Tom wouldn't do that.
6228150	eng	You knew that I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
6228151	eng	You knew how important doing that was to Tom, didn't you?
6228152	eng	I don't think Tom would be crazy enough to do something like that.
6228153	eng	I hope that Tom will do that.
6228154	eng	You didn't tell me you planned to wait until Monday to do that.
6228155	eng	You knew Tom was unlikely to want to do that, didn't you?
6228156	eng	I don't care where Tom does that as long as he doesn't do it here.
6228157	eng	I hope Tom will do that soon.
6228158	eng	You didn't know you weren't supposed to do that today, did you?
6228159	eng	You knew Tom said he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6228160	eng	I didn't know what time I was supposed to meet Tom at the airport.
6228161	eng	I hope Tom knows what to say.
6228162	eng	Since you've finished all your chores, you can go out and play.
6228163	eng	You haven't done that as many times as Tom has, have you?
6228164	eng	I didn't buy the model airplane that Tom wanted me to buy for him.
6228165	eng	I hope Tom knows what to buy.
6228166	eng	It took me a little longer than it usually does to fall asleep.
6228167	eng	You didn't tell Tom why I wanted him to do that, did you?
6228168	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you're going to do that, have you?
6228169	eng	I hope Tom isn't pessimistic.
6228170	eng	It probably wouldn't have been possible to do that by yourself.
6228171	eng	You didn't know that Tom expected me to do that, did you?
6228172	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you he didn't want to do that.
6228173	eng	I hope Tom isn't heartbroken.
6228174	eng	If you aren't busy, perhaps you could help me do that tomorrow.
6228175	eng	You didn't know Tom wanted to do that yesterday, did you?
6228176	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you he didn't need to do that.
6228177	eng	I hope Tom isn't embarrassed.
6228178	eng	I'd intended to do that yesterday, but it rained so I couldn't.
6228179	eng	You didn't know Tom thought I shouldn't do that, did you?
6228180	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you he didn't have to do that.
6228181	eng	I hope Tom isn't disobedient.
6228182	eng	I wasn't surprised that I didn't have to do what you had to do.
6228183	eng	You didn't know Tom didn't have time to do that, did you?
6228184	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told me you didn't have to do that.
6228185	eng	I hope Tom isn't discouraged.
6228186	eng	I thought I'd broken my leg, but an X-ray showed that I hadn't.
6228187	eng	There's no reason Tom needs to know why I didn't do that.
6228188	eng	You knew Tom wouldn't be able to do that before 2:30, didn't you?
6228189	eng	I hope Tom is doing that now.
6228190	eng	I realized I didn't have enough time to do what had to be done.
6228191	eng	There was no chance that Tom was going to win that fight.
6228192	eng	You don't think I'll be able to talk Tom into doing that, do you?
6228193	eng	I hope Tom enjoys doing that.
6228194	eng	I realize I don't have enough time to do what needs to be done.
6228195	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to close all the windows.
6228196	eng	You didn't think Tom would be doing that this afternoon, did you?
6228197	eng	I hope Tom doesn't get tired.
6228198	eng	I just found out that you're supposed to be good at doing that.
6228199	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be the first one to do that.
6228200	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you he wanted to do that.
6228201	eng	I hope Tom doesn't get bored.
6228202	eng	I don't like being the one who always has to feed the chickens.
6228203	eng	I wonder if Tom will be able to do that without any help.
6228204	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you he needed to do that.
6228205	eng	I helped Tom out of the boat.
6228206	eng	I didn't want to live in Boston anymore, so I moved to Chicago.
6228207	eng	I wish Tom had told me that he wasn't going to the party.
6228208	eng	You didn't know whether Tom was going to do that or not, did you?
6228209	eng	I helped Tom clean the house.
6228210	eng	I didn't want to admit that I was the one who broke the window.
6228211	eng	I wanted to kiss Tom, but I didn't have the nerve to try.
6228212	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the weather.
6228213	eng	I helped Tom a lot with that.
6228214	eng	I didn't recognize the person sitting across the table from me.
6228215	eng	I told Tom I didn't know anyone who lived on Park Street.
6228216	eng	The last time Tom gave a concert in Boston, only 300 people came.
6228217	eng	I help Tom with his homework.
6228218	eng	I didn't like French class very much when I was in high school.
6228219	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom would do that.
6228220	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's supposed to be here tomorrow by 2:30.
6228221	eng	I got Tom to help me do that.
6228222	eng	I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
6228223	eng	I thought Tom wasn't as cooperative as he should've been.
6228224	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have enough time to get everything done.
6228225	eng	I feel that Tom will do that.
6228226	eng	I didn't have enough time to do everything that had to be done.
6228227	eng	I think there's no point in trying to get Tom to do that.
6228228	eng	I thought you said you wanted to be the one who did that for Tom.
6228229	eng	I expect Tom to go to Boston.
6228230	eng	I didn't have enough time to do everything that I wanted to do.
6228231	eng	I should probably tell Tom I don't have to do that today.
6228232	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom would want to do that.
6228233	eng	I doubt that Tom can do that.
6228234	eng	I didn't get paid as much as I thought I was going to get paid.
6228235	eng	I should probably not tell Tom I don't intend to do that.
6228236	eng	I think doing that the way Tom suggested would be a lot more fun.
6228237	eng	I doubt if Tom will be upset.
6228238	eng	Didn't you know there was a good chance that this would happen?
6228239	eng	I rented Tom's old house and lived there for three years.
6228240	eng	I think Tom wouldn't likely to still be awake this late at night.
6228241	eng	I doubt if Tom will be tired.
6228242	eng	You weren't surprised that I wasn't able to do that, were you?
6228243	eng	I pretended I didn't understand what Tom wanted me to do.
6228244	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be here if he didn't think he could help us.
6228245	eng	I doubt if Tom will be ready.
6228246	eng	You weren't surprised that I didn't want to do that, were you?
6228247	eng	I know Tom didn't want to do that, but I think he had to.
6228249	eng	I doubt if Tom will be first.
6228250	eng	You weren't surprised that I didn't need to do that, were you?
6228251	eng	I just told Tom that he didn't have to help me on Monday.
6228252	eng	I should probably tell Tom that I can't do that without his help.
6228253	eng	I doubt if Tom will be early.
6228254	eng	You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?
6228255	eng	I don't think Tom would be afraid of something like this.
6228256	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be up at this time of night.
6228257	eng	I doubt if Tom will be drunk.
6228258	eng	You were worried you wouldn't be able to do that, weren't you?
6228259	eng	I don't think I should tell Tom that I'm going to Boston.
6228260	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be the first one to do that.
6228261	eng	I doubt if Tom will be bored.
6228262	eng	You knew it wasn't the first time I had done that, didn't you?
6228263	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom how much money I lost gambling.
6228264	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be interested in doing that.
6228265	eng	I doubt if Tom will be alone.
6228266	eng	You knew I might be required to do that by myself, didn't you?
6228267	eng	I didn't think Tom would be busy, so I went to visit him.
6228268	eng	I don't think Tom would be late unless he had a very good reason.
6228269	eng	I doubt Tom would lie to you.
6228270	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that you were supposed to do that.
6228271	eng	I didn't think Tom would be amused by what was happening.
6228272	eng	I don't think Tom would be bored if you told him about your trip.
6228273	eng	I don't write to Tom anymore.
6228274	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that I wasn't supposed to do that.
6228275	eng	I didn't tell Tom what we'd be discussing at the meeting.
6228276	eng	I don't think I'd be interested in buying any of Tom's paintings.
6228277	eng	I don't want to sit with Tom.
6228278	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you I wanted to do that.
6228279	eng	I didn't tell Tom what the meeting was going to be about.
6228280	eng	I don't think I should tell Tom that I don't know how to do that.
6228281	eng	I don't want Tom to buy that.
6228282	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you I needed to do that.
6228283	eng	I didn't know why Tom wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
6228284	eng	I don't always get up early, but I always get up before Tom does.
6228285	eng	I don't visit Tom very often.
6228286	eng	You didn't know we weren't supposed to do that today, did you?
6228287	eng	I didn't know where Tom was going to be in the afternoon.
6228288	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I planned to wait until Monday to do that.
6228289	eng	I don't trust Tom any longer.
6228290	eng	You didn't know that you wouldn't be able to do that, did you?
6228291	eng	I didn't know where Tom wanted me to plant the marigolds.
6228292	eng	I didn't know how to do that, so I asked Tom to tell show me how.
6228293	eng	I don't think Tom is worried.
6228294	eng	Including me, there are thirty people working on this project.
6228295	eng	I didn't know what Tom's reasons for not doing that were.
6228296	eng	I didn't believe that Tom had anything to do with the kidnapping.
6228297	eng	I don't think Tom is unlucky.
6228298	eng	If you like, you can use milk instead of water in this recipe.
6228299	eng	I didn't know that Tom had intended to do that yesterday.
6228300	eng	You should probably tell Tom that you don't want him to do that.
6228301	eng	I don't think Tom is thirsty.
6228302	eng	I'm getting a little tired of eating the same thing every day.
6228303	eng	I didn't know that Tom had broken up with his girlfriend.
6228304	eng	You should probably tell Tom that you don't know how to do that.
6228305	eng	I don't think Tom is strange.
6228306	eng	I'm better prepared this time, so I should be able to do that.
6228307	eng	I didn't know that I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
6228308	eng	You don't seem to understand why Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
6228309	eng	I don't think Tom is serious.
6228310	eng	I'll leave my porch light on, so you can easily find my house.
6228311	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to have to do that next week.
6228312	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
6228313	eng	I don't think Tom is retired.
6228314	eng	I wish I hadn't tried driving home after having drunk so much.
6228315	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom about what happened, but I did.
6228316	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you Tom wanted to do that.
6228317	eng	I don't think Tom is outside.
6228318	eng	I want to know if you're planning to come to my party tonight.
6228319	eng	I didn't have a chance to visit Tom when I was in Boston.
6228320	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you Tom needed to do that.
6228321	eng	I don't think Tom is nervous.
6228322	eng	I want to help, but I'm too busy doing other things right now.
6228323	eng	How much more time do you think Tom will need to do that?
6228324	eng	You didn't realize that Tom didn't know how to do that, did you?
6228325	eng	I don't think Tom is married.
6228326	eng	I thought I'd stay in Boston for a couple of weeks in October.
6228327	eng	How much more time do you think Tom will have to do that?
6228328	eng	You didn't know Tom wasn't going to be able to do that, did you?
6228329	eng	I don't think Tom is jealous.
6228330	eng	I think it's important to listen to both sides of an argument.
6228331	eng	How many weeks do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6228332	eng	You didn't know Tom was supposed to do that by himself, did you?
6228333	eng	I don't think Tom is engaged.
6228334	eng	I need to get rid of a lot of things that I don't use anymore.
6228335	eng	How many more days will it take Tom to finish doing that?
6228336	eng	When we were teenagers, I didn't like Tom and he didn't like me.
6228337	eng	I don't think Tom is correct.
6228338	eng	I knew I didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done.
6228339	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will want to do that?
6228340	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom not to do that?
6228341	eng	I don't think Tom is annoyed.
6228342	eng	I guess I should've expected something like this might happen.
6228343	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will need to do that?
6228344	eng	There's no reason Tom needs to know why I don't want to do that.
6228345	eng	I don't think Tom is adopted.
6228346	eng	I don't care that my car is the oldest one in the parking lot.
6228347	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will have to do that?
6228348	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know how to do that as well as most people do.
6228349	eng	I don't plan to wait for Tom.
6228350	eng	I didn't have time to answer all of the questions on the exam.
6228351	eng	How many hours do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6228352	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be forgiven if he did something like that.
6228353	eng	I don't let Tom play outside.
6228354	eng	How much more time do you think you need to finish doing that?
6228355	eng	Even though it's raining, Tom rode his bicycle to school.
6228356	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be inside on a beautiful afternoon like this.
6228357	eng	I don't let Tom drive my car.
6228358	eng	How many of your high school teacher's names can you remember?
6228359	eng	Even though Tom said he could do that, he wasn't able to.
6228360	eng	I'm sure Tom will be finished doing that by 2:30 this afternoon.
6228361	eng	I don't know where Tom lived.
6228362	eng	How long will it take for you to make sandwiches for everyone?
6228363	eng	Didn't you know that Tom said he wasn't going to do that?
6228364	eng	I want to make absolutely sure that Tom really wants to do that.
6228365	eng	I don't know what Tom bought.
6228366	eng	Don't wait up for me. I won't be home until very late tonight.
6228367	eng	Did you know that Tom was going to be in Boston all week?
6228368	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think I'd be able to do that by myself.
6228369	eng	I don't know how tall Tom is.
6228370	eng	Don't sign the contract until you have your lawyer look at it.
6228371	eng	Despite repeated warnings, Tom hasn't stopped doing that.
6228372	eng	I think Tom would be confused if you explain it to him that way.
6228373	eng	I don't know how rich Tom is.
6228374	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she needs to do that this week.
6228375	eng	Could Tom stay in Boston with you for a couple of months?
6228376	eng	I think Tom probably isn't as good at French as you think he is.
6228377	eng	I don't care where Tom works.
6228378	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she has to do that before 2:30.
6228379	eng	You're the one who persuaded Tom to do that, aren't you?
6228380	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I don't know how to do that.
6228382	eng	I don't care how Tom dresses.
6228383	eng	Didn't you know there was a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
6228384	eng	You'd stop doing that if Tom asked you to, wouldn't you?
6228385	eng	I know that Tom is looking for something, but I don't know what.
6228386	eng	I don't believe Tom did that.
6228387	eng	Did you know there are some broken bottles on your back porch?
6228388	eng	You'd do that for Tom if he wanted you to, wouldn't you?
6228389	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will do what you want him to do.
6228390	eng	I didn't want to go with Tom.
6228391	eng	"Are you going to do that today?" "No, I'll do that tomorrow."
6228392	eng	You weren't the one who wanted Tom to do that, were you?
6228393	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be the next one to do that.
6228394	eng	I didn't think Tom was upset.
6228395	eng	You'll be finished doing that by the end of the week, I hope.
6228396	eng	You were expecting Tom to help you do that, weren't you?
6228397	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be the last one to do that.
6228398	eng	I didn't think Tom was tired.
6228399	eng	You'd be very disappointed if I didn't do that, wouldn't you?
6228400	eng	You tried to discourage Tom from doing that, didn't you?
6228401	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be forgiven for doing that.
6228402	eng	I didn't think Tom was right.
6228403	eng	You won't know whether you can do that or not unless you try.
6228404	eng	You think we shouldn't permit Tom to do that, don't you?
6228405	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excused from doing that.
6228406	eng	I didn't think Tom was ready.
6228407	eng	You still haven't learned how to do that correctly, have you?
6228408	eng	You still haven't forgiven Tom for doing that, have you?
6228409	eng	I don't think Tom has been doing what he's supposed to be doing.
6228410	eng	I didn't think Tom was drunk.
6228411	eng	You don't seem to have the confidence to do that by yourself.
6228412	eng	You should've told Tom why it was a bad idea to do that.
6228413	eng	I didn't think Tom would enjoy our party, so I didn't invite him.
6228414	eng	I didn't think Tom was broke.
6228415	eng	You don't have to do that, but it would be better if you did.
6228416	eng	You should probably tell Tom he doesn't need to do that.
6228417	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I didn't want him to go to Boston with me.
6228418	eng	I didn't think Tom was bored.
6228419	eng	You didn't think I'd be finished doing that by 2:30, did you?
6228420	eng	You should probably not tell Tom that you can't do that.
6228421	eng	I didn't know whether Tom wanted to go to Boston with me or not.
6228422	eng	I didn't think Tom was awake.
6228423	eng	You didn't know that I didn't have to do that today, did you?
6228424	eng	You might've been able to do that if Tom had helped you.
6228425	eng	I didn't know if Tom would be able to do that by himself or not.
6228426	eng	I didn't think Tom was alone.
6228427	eng	You didn't know I was supposed to do that by myself, did you?
6228428	eng	You know that Tom isn't the one who did that, don't you?
6228429	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't have enough money to pay all his bills.
6228430	eng	I didn't tell Tom what to do.
6228431	eng	We abandoned the project because we didn't have enough money.
6228432	eng	You knew Tom didn't have to do that anymore, didn't you?
6228433	eng	How did you know Tom was going to be released from prison today?
6228434	eng	I didn't tell Tom to do that.
6228435	eng	The woman sitting next to me on the plane was very talkative.
6228436	eng	You don't really expect Tom to be at your party, do you?
6228437	eng	Don't forget to tell Tom what time the meeting's going to start.
6228438	eng	I didn't tell Tom I was busy.
6228439	eng	The passengers with injuries were taken to a nearby hospital.
6228440	eng	You didn't tell Tom I didn't intend to do that, did you?
6228441	eng	Do you believe that there's a possibility that Tom will do that?
6228442	eng	I didn't recognize Tom's dog.
6228443	eng	The last thing I remember was the sound of someone behind me.
6228444	eng	You didn't seem to understand why Tom wanted to do that.
6228445	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was planning to attend today's meeting?
6228446	eng	I didn't recognize Tom's car.
6228447	eng	Speaking only in French all day was a good experience for me.
6228448	eng	You didn't seem to understand why Tom needed to do that.
6228449	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't like sports at all when he was a kid?
6228450	eng	I didn't know where Tom went.
6228451	eng	My parents wouldn't permit me to do that when I was your age.
6228452	eng	You didn't know why Tom didn't want to do that, did you?
6228453	eng	You've given up trying to persuade Tom to do that, haven't you?
6228454	eng	I didn't know what Tom meant.
6228455	eng	If I'd been there, I would've suggested doing something else.
6228456	eng	You didn't know why Tom didn't need to do that, did you?
6228457	eng	You've given up trying to convince Tom to do that, haven't you?
6228458	eng	I didn't know Tom was a twin.
6228459	eng	I'm getting a little tired of doing the same thing every day.
6228460	eng	You didn't know why Tom didn't have to do that, did you?
6228461	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you wanted to do that, have you?
6228462	eng	I didn't have to go with Tom.
6228463	eng	I wish I hadn't tried driving home after I had drunk so much.
6228464	eng	You didn't know Tom wasn't supposed to do that, did you?
6228465	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you needed to do that, have you?
6228466	eng	I didn't give Tom any choice.
6228467	eng	I understand a little French, but I can't speak it very well.
6228468	eng	You didn't know Tom was going to do that today, did you?
6228469	eng	You still have no idea why Tom doesn't want to do that, do you?
6228470	eng	I didn't give Tom any advice.
6228471	eng	I thought you said you wanted to do that as soon as possible.
6228472	eng	You didn't know Tom had never done that before, did you?
6228473	eng	You should tell Tom that he should do that as soon as possible.
6228474	eng	I didn't follow Tom's advice.
6228475	eng	I thought you said you wanted to be the first one to do that.
6228476	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't be able to do that by himself?
6228477	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you that you had to do that.
6228478	eng	I didn't call Tom last night.
6228479	eng	I thought you said you didn't know how to play the saxophone.
6228480	eng	There's no reason Tom has to know why I want to do that.
6228481	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told me I didn't need to do that.
6228482	eng	I can't do that, but Tom can.
6228483	eng	I think we would be able to do that without making any noise.
6228484	eng	There's no chance that Tom will ever be able to do that.
6228485	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't want to stop doing that, didn't you?
6228486	eng	How often do you talk to Tom?
6228487	eng	I think it'll be impossible to do that without a lot of help.
6228488	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom should've done that.
6228489	eng	You knew Tom told everyone he was going to do that, didn't you?
6228490	eng	How often do you go to Tom's?
6228491	eng	I realize I don't have enough time to do what has to be done.
6228492	eng	Since the weather was good, Tom and I went to the beach.
6228493	eng	You didn't think Tom would want to do that by himself, did you?
6228494	eng	How many cookies did Tom eat?
6228495	eng	I realize I don't have enough money to buy everything I want.
6228496	eng	It would've been safer to do that the way Tom suggested.
6228497	eng	You didn't tell Tom that I didn't know how to do that, did you?
6228498	eng	How long was Tom at the park?
6228499	eng	I realize I don't have enough money to buy everything I need.
6228500	eng	If it had rained yesterday, Tom wouldn't have done that.
6228501	eng	Why did you tell Tom I planned to wait until Monday to do that?
6228502	eng	Has Tom ever lived in Boston?
6228503	eng	I knew I should say something, but I didn't know what to say.
6228504	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be the next one to do that.
6228505	eng	We don't have to tell Tom how to do that. He already knows how.
6228506	eng	Everyone did that except Tom.
6228507	eng	I knew I didn't have enough money to buy everything I wanted.
6228508	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be the last one to do that.
6228509	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the smell.
6228510	eng	Even Tom was speaking French.
6228511	eng	I knew I didn't have enough money to buy everything I needed.
6228512	eng	I'm quite sure Tom doesn't have any relatives in Boston.
6228513	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the noise.
6228514	eng	Don't you feel sorry for Tom?
6228515	eng	I guess I'm never going to be able to do that as well as you.
6228516	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom has no intention of doing that.
6228517	eng	There's a good chance that Tom will be arrested for doing that.
6228518	eng	Does Tom wish to do that now?
6228519	eng	I don't like being the one who always has to wash the dishes.
6228520	eng	I'm fairly certain that Tom doesn't know how to do that.
6228521	eng	If Tom did that yesterday, he probably won't do it again today.
6228522	eng	Does Tom want to do that now?
6228523	eng	I don't know who I should ask to help me figure out my taxes.
6228524	eng	I wouldn't have visited Boston if Tom hadn't told me to.
6228525	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be the one responsible for what happened.
6228526	eng	Do you think Tom was helpful?
6228527	eng	I don't care where we do that as long as we don't do it here.
6228528	eng	I wouldn't have gone to Boston if Tom hadn't told me to.
6228529	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't have to do what I had to do.
6228530	eng	Do you think Tom is friendly?
6228531	eng	I didn't know that you were the one who wanted us to do that.
6228532	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom that I'd go to Boston with him.
6228533	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom would need our help.
6228534	eng	Do you know why Tom was late?
6228535	eng	I didn't know that I was the one who was supposed to do that.
6228536	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he didn't need to do that.
6228537	eng	I think Tom would be embarrassed if he did something like that.
6228538	eng	Didn't you know Tom was rich?
6228539	eng	I didn't know how to answer any of the questions on the test.
6228540	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he didn't have to do that.
6228541	eng	I pretended that I didn't know that Tom had stolen my computer.
6228542	eng	Did you know Tom was married?
6228543	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy everything I wanted to buy.
6228544	eng	I wasn't the first one to volunteer to help Tom do that.
6228545	eng	I made a list of places I wanted to visit and showed it to Tom.
6228546	eng	Did Tom use to be a teacher?
6228547	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy everything I needed to buy.
6228548	eng	I was willing to do that, but Tom said I didn't need to.
6228549	eng	I knew Tom wasn't going to be able to do that without our help.
6228550	eng	Ask Tom what he wants to eat.
6228551	eng	I did that this morning so I wouldn't have to do it tomorrow.
6228552	eng	I was willing to do that, but Tom said I didn't have to.
6228553	eng	I didn't want to admit that Tom was right and that I was wrong.
6228554	eng	Ask Tom if he has to do that.
6228555	eng	I bought some postcards to send to my friends back in Boston.
6228556	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do that with us.
6228557	eng	I didn't know who Tom had decided to give his old saxophone to.
6228558	eng	You're a lot older than Tom.
6228559	eng	How much more time do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6228560	eng	I want to know when you're going to tell Tom about that.
6228561	eng	I didn't know the reason why Tom wouldn't accept my invitation.
6228562	eng	You work for Tom, don't you?
6228563	eng	Have you decided where you're going for your summer vacation?
6228564	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
6228565	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom to do that. He'd have done it anyway.
6228566	eng	You usually do that for Tom.
6228567	eng	Do you think you can do that without getting yourself killed?
6228568	eng	I told Tom that I didn't know how to play the saxophone.
6228569	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom about what happened. He already knew.
6228570	eng	You tripped Tom, didn't you?
6228571	eng	Do you sometimes get in trouble with your teachers at school?
6228572	eng	I told Tom some things about Boston that he didn't know.
6228573	eng	Did you know that Tom isn't planning to attend today's meeting?
6228574	eng	You stabbed Tom, didn't you?
6228575	eng	You're the only one who seems to know what needs to be done.
6228576	eng	I thought it was really nice of you to buy that for Tom.
6228577	eng	You should probably tell Tom he doesn't have to do that today.
6228578	eng	You spit on Tom, didn't you?
6228579	eng	You look a lot more like your father than your brother does.
6228580	eng	I thought Tom would be more difficult to get along with.
6228581	eng	You should probably not tell Tom that you know how to do that.
6228582	eng	You slapped Tom, didn't you?
6228583	eng	You knew I wouldn't have enough time to do that, didn't you?
6228584	eng	I thought Tom would be interested in doing that with us.
6228585	eng	You know that Tom is still living with his parents, don't you?
6228586	eng	You scolded Tom, didn't you?
6228587	eng	You don't seem to understand why you're supposed to do that.
6228588	eng	I thought Tom might be interested in doing that with us.
6228589	eng	You knew that Tom was unlikely to want to do that, didn't you?
6228590	eng	You punched Tom, didn't you?
6228591	eng	You didn't think that you would be able to do that, did you?
6228592	eng	I think you won't be able to do that without Tom's help.
6228593	eng	You knew that Tom said he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6228594	eng	You invited Tom, didn't you?
6228595	eng	You didn't think I'd be through doing that by 2:30, did you?
6228596	eng	I think Tom would probably be happy to buy that for you.
6228597	eng	You didn't seem to understand why Tom was supposed to do that.
6228598	eng	You do that faster than Tom.
6228599	eng	You didn't think I was going to be able to do that, did you?
6228600	eng	I think Tom would like to be present at today's meeting.
6228601	eng	You didn't seem surprised when Tom told you he had to do that.
6228602	eng	You cook for Tom, don't you?
6228603	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that you didn't need to do that.
6228604	eng	I think Tom is the only one who doesn't want to do that.
6228605	eng	You didn't know who Tom was planning to do that with, did you?
6228606	eng	Will Tom come here today?
6228607	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that you didn't have to do that.
6228608	eng	I think Tom is the only one who doesn't need to do that.
6228609	eng	You didn't know whether Tom wanted to do that or not, did you?
6228610	eng	Will Tom be able to do that?
6228611	eng	You didn't know you were supposed to do that today, did you?
6228612	eng	I think Tom is the only one who doesn't have to do that.
6228613	eng	You didn't know Tom wasn't supposed to do that today, did you?
6228614	eng	Why's Tom staying in Boston?
6228615	eng	You didn't know that we were the ones who did that, did you?
6228616	eng	I should've told Tom that he wasn't supposed to do that.
6228617	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the heat.
6228618	eng	Why should Tom visit Boston?
6228619	eng	This morning's meeting was shorter than I expected it to be.
6228620	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I intend to do that.
6228621	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the food.
6228622	eng	Why should Tom go to Boston?
6228623	eng	The teacher told me that I'm the worst student in the class.
6228624	eng	I saw Tom walking in the park with a girl I didn't know.
6228625	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained about the cold.
6228626	eng	Why is Tom coming to Boston?
6228627	eng	The movie was much better than I thought it was going to be.
6228628	eng	I knew there was a chance that Tom would need some help.
6228629	eng	There's no reason Tom has to know why I don't want to do that.
6228630	eng	Why didn't Tom visit Boston?
6228631	eng	It'll probably be impossible for you to do that by yourself.
6228632	eng	I hope Tom wasn't the one responsible for what happened.
6228633	eng	The largest fish Tom caught weighed just over three kilograms.
6228634	eng	Why didn't Tom go to Boston?
6228635	eng	It would probably not be interesting to do that by yourself.
6228636	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be annoyed by that.
6228637	eng	That's the woman I saw talking with Tom in the park yesterday.
6228638	eng	Why did Tom want to do that?
6228639	eng	It took me a more time than usual to fall asleep last night.
6228640	eng	I don't yet know if Tom will go with me tomorrow or not.
6228641	eng	If I'd known Tom was broke, I'd have offered to buy him lunch.
6228642	eng	Why did Tom need to do that?
6228643	eng	It started to rain as soon as we finished pitching the tent.
6228644	eng	I don't want to tell Tom how much money I lost gambling.
6228645	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom wouldn't be interested in doing that.
6228646	eng	Why did Tom do that for you?
6228647	eng	If you had done that, there wouldn't have been any problems.
6228648	eng	I don't think that Tom would ever do that kind of thing.
6228649	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who wants to do that.
6228650	eng	Who went to Boston with Tom?
6228651	eng	I've been going to Boston every summer since I was thirteen.
6228652	eng	I don't think that Tom was the one who stole my bicycle.
6228653	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who needs to do that.
6228654	eng	When will Tom be doing that?
6228655	eng	I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're trying to say.
6228656	eng	I don't think Tom would be here if he didn't want to be.
6228657	eng	I'm not going to be the one who tells Tom what he needs to do.
6228658	eng	When did Tom move to Boston?
6228659	eng	I won't go outside in this kind of weather unless I have to.
6228660	eng	I don't think Tom would be here if he didn't need to be.
6228661	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think you'd be able to do that today.
6228662	eng	When did Tom come to Boston?
6228663	eng	I thought you said you wanted to be the next one to do that.
6228664	eng	I don't think Tom would be here if he didn't have to be.
6228665	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think you'd be able to do that again.
6228666	eng	When I saw Tom I said hello.
6228667	eng	I thought you said you wanted to be the last one to do that.
6228668	eng	I don't think Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
6228669	eng	I thought you said you're tired of waiting for Tom to do that.
6228670	eng	What you did made Tom smile.
6228671	eng	I thought you said you wanted to be excused from doing that.
6228672	eng	I don't think Tom really knows how to do that very well.
6228673	eng	I think this is the first time Tom has done that without help.
6228674	eng	What you did made Tom laugh.
6228675	eng	I think that what you're looking for is behind the cupboard.
6228676	eng	I don't think I understand why Tom is trying to do that.
6228677	eng	I think there's no point in trying to persuade Tom to do that.
6228678	eng	What you did made Tom happy.
6228679	eng	I think that buying a grand piano would be a waste of money.
6228680	eng	I don't need to wash the car. Tom has already washed it.
6228681	eng	I think there's no point in trying to convince Tom to do that.
6228682	eng	What did you tell Tom to do?
6228683	eng	I suggest not staying in Boston any longer than you have to.
6228684	eng	I don't like the music the kind of music Tom listens to.
6228685	eng	I think it would be strange for Tom to do something like that.
6228686	eng	What Tom will do is unclear.
6228687	eng	I know I won't be able to do that if I don't have some help.
6228688	eng	I don't know whether Tom will come by car or by bicycle.
6228689	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be confused if you'd explained it better.
6228690	eng	Were you in Boston with Tom?
6228691	eng	I know I don't have enough time to do what needs to be done.
6228692	eng	I don't have to wash the car. Tom has already washed it.
6228693	eng	I think Tom would get bored if you showed him all your photos.
6228695	eng	I knew that what I was doing was wrong, but I did it anyway.
6228696	eng	I don't have the faintest idea what Tom is trying to do.
6228697	eng	I think Tom would be able to do that if he put his mind to it.
6228698	eng	Was Tom wearing a seat belt?
6228699	eng	I haven't taught French since I left Boston three years ago.
6228700	eng	I didn't want Tom to know that I didn't know what to do.
6228701	eng	I think Tom is the only one working here who can speak French.
6228702	eng	There's no way Tom did that.
6228703	eng	I don't want any of my friends to know that I can't do that.
6228704	eng	I didn't think Tom would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6228705	eng	I think Tom is probably better at French than you think he is.
6228706	eng	Tell Tom that we're leaving.
6228707	eng	I didn't tell my parents that I had gotten an F on the test.
6228708	eng	I didn't think Tom was glad that that's going to happen.
6228709	eng	I think Tom doesn't know he's supposed to give a speech today.
6228710	eng	Please tell Tom to be quiet.
6228711	eng	I didn't tell anyone about what happened until I was thirty.
6228712	eng	I didn't think I should do what Tom was asking me to do.
6228713	eng	I think Tom can't actually do that even though he says he can.
6228714	eng	Never buy anything from Tom.
6228715	eng	I didn't know that you were going to be in Boston this week.
6228716	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I was the one who had to do that.
6228718	eng	Let's permit Tom to do that.
6228719	eng	I didn't know that we were supposed to do that by ourselves.
6228720	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I didn't have a driver's license.
6228721	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be in Boston next Monday.
6228722	eng	Let's go to Boston with Tom.
6228723	eng	How many months will it take to finish building this bridge?
6228724	eng	I didn't realize Tom wasn't going to be able to do that.
6228725	eng	I don't think this is the first time Tom has tried to do that.
6228726	eng	Let Tom watch what he wants.
6228727	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she has to do that this week.
6228728	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to go to Boston with.
6228729	eng	I don't think Tom would be willing to lend me his new bicycle.
6228730	eng	Let Tom drink what he wants.
6228731	eng	Doing that the way you're suggesting would be too expensive.
6228732	eng	I didn't know who Tom thought was going to win the race.
6228733	eng	I don't think Tom would be embarrassed by something like that.
6228734	eng	It's only Tom who does that.
6228735	eng	Do you still enjoy watching baseball as much as you used to?
6228736	eng	I didn't know whether to accept Tom's gift or refuse it.
6228737	eng	I don't need to tell Tom how to do that. He already knows how.
6228738	eng	It looks like Tom is crying.
6228739	eng	Are we supposed to take off our shoes when we enter a house?
6228740	eng	I didn't know whether Tom would agree to do that or not.
6228741	eng	I didn't think it would be safe for Tom to do that by himself.
6228742	eng	Is Tom permitted to do that?
6228743	eng	"Have you done that already?" "No, I haven't done that yet."
6228744	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was good at doing that or not.
6228745	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to do that without some help.
6228746	eng	I've never seen Tom do that.
6228747	eng	You're the only person I know who can play the French horn.
6228748	eng	I didn't know Tom wasn't supposed to do that by himself.
6228749	eng	I didn't make it to the airport in time to say goodbye to Tom.
6228750	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be tired.
6228751	eng	You know I wouldn't be stupid enough to do that, don't you?
6228752	eng	I didn't ask whether Tom was planning to do that or not.
6228753	eng	I didn't know why Tom didn't need to do that until he told me.
6228754	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be first.
6228755	eng	You hope that you won't have to do that anymore, don't you?
6228756	eng	How much time do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6228757	eng	I didn't know why Tom didn't have to do that until he told me.
6228758	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be early.
6228759	eng	You don't have your parents' permission to do this, do you?
6228760	eng	How many minutes do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6228761	eng	I didn't know that Tom would be cooking dinner for us tonight.
6228762	eng	I'm sure Tom will be sleepy.
6228763	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that I was supposed to do that.
6228764	eng	How many days do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6228765	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to be at the party last week.
6228766	eng	I'm sure Tom will be scared.
6228767	eng	You didn't know we were supposed to do that today, did you?
6228768	eng	Don't waste your time trying to convince Tom to do that.
6228769	eng	I didn't have to pay Tom as much as I thought I would have to.
6228770	eng	I'm sure Tom will be afraid.
6228771	eng	You didn't know that I wasn't supposed to do that, did you?
6228772	eng	Didn't you know Tom has several very valuable paintings?
6228773	eng	You weren't really expecting Tom to do that for me, were you?
6228774	eng	I'm sure Tom will be absent.
6228775	eng	What's the main advantage of doing that the way you suggest?
6228776	eng	Ask Tom if he plans to be at the meeting this afternoon.
6228777	eng	You were the one who suggested that Tom do that, weren't you?
6228778	eng	I'm sure Tom has to do that.
6228779	eng	What part of the report do you think needs to be rewritten.
6228780	eng	You weren't the one who asked Tom to do that, were you?
6228781	eng	You tried to convince Tom not to do that anymore, didn't you?
6228782	eng	I'm on the same team Tom is.
6228783	eng	We won't be able to stay in Boston as long as we wanted to.
6228784	eng	You weren't able to teach Tom how to do that, were you?
6228785	eng	You told Tom I thought it would be OK to do that, didn't you?
6228786	eng	I'm not the same age as Tom.
6228787	eng	We want you to come to Boston and stay with us next summer.
6228788	eng	You weren't able to talk Tom into doing that, were you?
6228789	eng	You told Tom I couldn't do that without his help, didn't you?
6228790	eng	I'm not going to Tom's concert.
6228791	eng	This morning's meeting was longer than I expected it to be.
6228792	eng	You told Tom I thought he couldn't do that, didn't you?
6228793	eng	You still haven't told Tom why you want to do that, have you?
6228794	eng	I'm going over to Tom's now.
6228795	eng	This kind of rain isn't that unusual for this time of year.
6228796	eng	You told Tom I didn't feel like doing that, didn't you?
6228797	eng	You still haven't told Tom why he needs to do that, have you?
6228798	eng	I'm Tom's ex-wife's husband.
6228799	eng	Some of my friends think Boston isn't a safe place to live.
6228800	eng	You think Tom could've done that on his own, don't you?
6228801	eng	You should probably not tell Tom you don't intend to do that.
6228802	eng	I'd like to see Tom do that.
6228803	eng	Many people have asked me if I think Boston is a safe city.
6228804	eng	You shouldn't have tried doing that without Tom's help.
6228805	eng	You knew that Tom wasn't really going to do that, didn't you?
6228806	eng	I'd expected Tom to do that.
6228807	eng	It took me a little more time than usual to get here today.
6228808	eng	You should tell Tom that you don't know how to do that.
6228809	eng	You didn't seem to understand why Tom didn't want to do that.
6228810	eng	I wouldn't do that with Tom.
6228811	eng	It probably wouldn't have been wise to do that by yourself.
6228812	eng	You should probably tell Tom you won't do that anymore.
6228813	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom was supposed to do that.
6228814	eng	I wouldn't buy that for Tom.
6228815	eng	It probably wouldn't have been safe to do that by yourself.
6228816	eng	You should probably tell Tom you don't have to do that.
6228817	eng	You didn't seem surprised when I told you Tom had to do that.
6228818	eng	I wonder what Tom has to do.
6228819	eng	It probably wouldn't have been easy to do that by yourself.
6228820	eng	You should let Tom know that you don't want to do that.
6228821	eng	You didn't know that Tom wasn't supposed to do that, did you?
6228822	eng	I wonder what Tom had to do.
6228823	eng	It probably wouldn't be interesting to do that by yourself.
6228824	eng	You should let Tom know that you don't need to do that.
6228825	eng	We have to stay in Boston until Tom gets out of the hospital.
6228826	eng	I wonder if Tom is ticklish.
6228827	eng	It probably would've been dangerous to do that by yourself.
6228828	eng	You should let Tom know that you don't have to do that.
6228829	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he shouldn't do that?
6228830	eng	I wonder if Tom is relieved.
6228831	eng	I've heard that a baby deer can stand as soon as it's born.
6228832	eng	You know how important doing that is to Tom, don't you?
6228833	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he needed to do that?
6228834	eng	I wonder if Tom is reliable.
6228835	eng	I've been told that we're not allowed to swim here anymore.
6228836	eng	You knew that Tom wasn't likely to do that, didn't you?
6228837	eng	The most important thing for you to do now is to talk to Tom.
6228838	eng	I wonder if Tom is mistaken.
6228839	eng	I'm still driving the same car that my grandmother gave me.
6228840	eng	You knew Tom didn't really want to do that, didn't you?
6228841	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom shouldn't have done that.
6228842	eng	I wonder if Tom is innocent.
6228843	eng	I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're trying to do.
6228844	eng	You have to make sure that Tom doesn't do that anymore.
6228845	eng	Is it true that Tom won't be at the meeting tomorrow morning?
6228846	eng	I wonder if Tom is homesick.
6228847	eng	I'm feeling a little bit better today than I was yesterday.
6228848	eng	You have no idea why Tom wanted you to stop doing that.
6228849	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me I didn't have to do that.
6228850	eng	I wonder if Tom is finished.
6228851	eng	I wish I hadn't forgotten to study for today's French test.
6228852	eng	You had no idea when Tom was going to do that, did you?
6228853	eng	I was finished doing that by the time Tom offered to help me.
6228854	eng	I wonder if Tom is confused.
6228855	eng	I was able to do that better than I thought I'd be able to.
6228856	eng	You don't think Tom wants to do that right now, do you?
6228857	eng	I thought you said you wanted Tom to show you how to do that.
6228858	eng	I wonder if Tom is artistic.
6228859	eng	I thought you said you've only done that about three times.
6228860	eng	You don't really think that Tom should do that, do you?
6228861	eng	I thought Tom was going to be able to meet me at the airport.
6228862	eng	I wonder if Tom can do that.
6228863	eng	I think doing that will take longer than you think it will.
6228864	eng	You didn't think Tom would be doing that here, did you?
6228865	eng	I think Tom won't be interested in buying any of these books.
6228866	eng	I won't tell Tom what to do.
6228867	eng	I realized I didn't have enough money to buy what I wanted.
6228868	eng	You didn't think Tom would be able to do that, did you?
6228869	eng	I think Tom wants to do that, even though he says he doesn't.
6228870	eng	I won't tell Tom to do that.
6228871	eng	I realized I didn't have enough money to buy what I needed.
6228872	eng	You didn't think Tom was the one who did that, did you?
6228873	eng	I think Tom is probably better at chess than you think he is.
6228874	eng	I won't do that without Tom.
6228875	eng	I knew I didn't have enough time to do what had to be done.
6228876	eng	You didn't think Tom could do that by himself, did you?
6228877	eng	I should tell Tom that he should do that as soon as possible.
6228878	eng	I wish Tom wasn't mad at me.
6228879	eng	I hope we can figure out what to do about that pretty soon.
6228880	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom wanted to do that.
6228881	eng	I noticed that there was a picture of Tom on the mantelpiece.
6228882	eng	I wasn't ready, but Tom was.
6228883	eng	I hope I don't have to live in Boston for more than a year.
6228884	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom shouldn't do that.
6228885	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be motivated to do that.
6228886	eng	I wasn't able to rescue Tom.
6228887	eng	I don't care who does the job as long as the job gets done.
6228888	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom needed to do that.
6228889	eng	I don't think there's any need for Tom to attend the meeting.
6228890	eng	I warned Tom not to do that.
6228891	eng	I didn't realize how important it was to be at the meeting.
6228892	eng	You didn't realize that Tom wanted to do that, did you?
6228893	eng	I don't think Tom would be worried about something like that.
6228894	eng	I wanted to see Tom do that.
6228895	eng	I didn't read the instructions as carefully as I should've.
6228896	eng	You didn't know Tom had to do that by himself, did you?
6228897	eng	I don't think Tom will ever be able to afford to buy a house.
6228898	eng	I want to talk to Tom again.
6228899	eng	I didn't learn how to play the guitar until I was thirteen.
6228900	eng	You did that the way Tom told you to do it, didn't you?
6228901	eng	I don't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday morning.
6228902	eng	I want to break up with Tom.
6228903	eng	I didn't have time to answer all the questions on the test.
6228904	eng	Who told you Tom didn't want to go skin diving with us?
6228905	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom refused to help me do that.
6228906	eng	I want to be married to Tom.
6228907	eng	I didn't have enough time to finish my homework last night.
6228908	eng	When was the last time you told Tom that you loved him?
6228909	eng	I didn't know the reason why Tom couldn't go camping with us.
6228910	eng	I waited for Tom to do that.
6228911	eng	I didn't find the word I was looking for in the dictionary.
6228912	eng	We've been asked not to say anything to Tom about this.
6228913	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't supposed to do that by himself.
6228914	eng	I told Tom that I'd do that.
6228915	eng	I didn't eat all of the ice cream. There's still a little left.
6228916	eng	We don't have to tell Tom what to do. He already knows.
6228917	eng	I didn't hitchhike home, even though I told Tom that I would.
6228918	eng	I thought that Tom did that.
6228919	eng	How many minutes do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6228920	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom not to do that?
6228921	eng	How much more time do you estimate it'll take Tom to do that?
6228922	eng	I thought Tom would help us.
6228923	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that.
6228924	eng	There's no reason Tom has to know why I didn't do that.
6228925	eng	How many months do you think Tom has spent doing that so far?
6228926	eng	I thought Tom would do that.
6228927	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that.
6228928	eng	The police said they thought Tom had died Monday night.
6228929	eng	Don't forget that Tom is coming over for dinner this evening.
6228930	eng	I thought Tom would be late.
6228931	eng	Doing that was more interesting than I thought it would be.
6228932	eng	The only one here who doesn't regret doing that is Tom.
6228933	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to be in Boston this week?
6228934	eng	I thought Tom would be last.
6228935	eng	Didn't I tell you that you didn't need to worry about that?
6228936	eng	Please try to find out why Tom did that the way he did.
6228937	eng	Are you the one who helped Tom hang that picture on the wall?
6228938	eng	I thought Tom wasn't scared.
6228939	eng	Did you know there was a Chinese restaurant on Park Street?
6228940	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to do that sometime this week.
6228941	eng	You're the one who persuaded Tom not to do that, aren't you?
6228942	eng	I thought Tom wasn't afraid.
6228943	eng	You're the only person in the office who can speak French.
6228944	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why he's getting another chance.
6228945	eng	You warned Tom what would happen if he did that, didn't you?
6228946	eng	I thought Tom wasn't absent.
6228947	eng	You're the only person I've ever really been in love with.
6228948	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know who can sing well and who can't.
6228949	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you he wanted to do that.
6228950	eng	I thought Tom was terrified.
6228951	eng	You're the only one who doesn't seem to be having any fun.
6228952	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to park there.
6228953	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told you he needed to do that.
6228954	eng	I thought Tom was surprised.
6228955	eng	You'd have to be very desperate to do something like that.
6228956	eng	In addition to the saxophone, Tom plays the flute, too.
6228957	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told us why we should do that.
6228958	eng	I thought Tom was miserable.
6228959	eng	You wore glasses when you were in high school, didn't you?
6228960	eng	I've promised Tom that I wouldn't go to Boston anymore.
6228961	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom told us why we had to do that.
6228962	eng	I thought Tom was insincere.
6228963	eng	You weren't the first one to volunteer to help us do that.
6228964	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be alone on Christmas Eve.
6228965	eng	You never had any intention of letting Tom do that, did you?
6228966	eng	I thought Tom was impressed.
6228967	eng	You knew I wasn't going to be able to do that, didn't you?
6228968	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom has overstepped his authority.
6228969	eng	You need to be very talented to do that the way Tom does it.
6228970	eng	I thought Tom was desperate.
6228971	eng	You don't think I'll be able to do that by myself, do you?
6228972	eng	I wish I hadn't promised Tom I'd go to Boston with him.
6228973	eng	You know that Tom can't do that as well as I can, don't you?
6228974	eng	I thought Tom looked sleepy.
6228975	eng	You don't seem to understand why I'm reluctant to do that.
6228976	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me why we should do that.
6228977	eng	You knew that Tom wasn't going to do that today, didn't you?
6228978	eng	I thought Tom looked lonely.
6228979	eng	You didn't think I'd be the first one to do that, did you?
6228980	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me why we had to do that.
6228981	eng	You knew Tom wasn't going to be able to do that, didn't you?
6228982	eng	I thought Tom looked hungry.
6228983	eng	You didn't think I'd be interested in doing that, did you?
6228984	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me why he had to do that.
6228985	eng	You knew Tom couldn't do that without your help, didn't you?
6228986	eng	I thought Tom had done that.
6228987	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that I didn't need to do that.
6228988	eng	I want to make sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
6228989	eng	You knew Tom couldn't do that without some help, didn't you?
6228990	eng	I think Tom would be scared.
6228991	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that I didn't have to do that.
6228992	eng	I waited for Tom all afternoon, but he never showed up.
6228993	eng	You have to be very talented to do that the way Tom does it.
6228994	eng	I think Tom would be biased.
6228995	eng	You didn't know that we were supposed to do that, did you?
6228996	eng	I told Tom I wouldn't do that unless he did it with me.
6228997	eng	You forgot to ask Tom for permission to do that, didn't you?
6228998	eng	I think Tom won't be scared.
6228999	eng	What kind of things are we going to be doing at the party?
6229000	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to be helping Tom today.
6229001	eng	You don't seem to understand why Tom is supposed to do that.
6229002	eng	I think Tom won't be lonely.
6229003	eng	What are the advantages and disadvantages of owning a dog?
6229004	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that this morning.
6229005	eng	You don't seem to understand why Tom didn't want to do that.
6229006	eng	I think Tom won't be afraid.
6229007	eng	We put all our old furniture in the shed behind our house.
6229008	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask someone else to do that.
6229009	eng	You didn't think that Tom would be able to do that, did you?
6229010	eng	I think Tom won't be absent.
6229011	eng	We had to be in Boston for an important meeting last week.
6229012	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask everyone not to do that.
6229013	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom didn't want to do that.
6229014	eng	I think Tom will be worried.
6229015	eng	We didn't have enough time to do that yesterday afternoon.
6229016	eng	I thought Tom might be permitted to do that by himself.
6229017	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom didn't need to do that.
6229018	eng	I think Tom will be nervous.
6229019	eng	There's just no way that we can finish doing that by 2:30.
6229020	eng	I thought I'd never be able to convince Tom to do that.
6229021	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom didn't have to do that.
6229022	eng	I think Tom will be jealous.
6229023	eng	The man sitting on the park bench didn't seem to be awake.
6229024	eng	I think Tom would probably be happy to do that for you.
6229025	eng	You didn't really think Tom would enjoy doing that, did you?
6229026	eng	I think Tom will be furious.
6229027	eng	The man sitting next to me on the train looked very tired.
6229028	eng	I think Tom will likely give you permission to do that.
6229029	eng	You didn't realize that Tom didn't want to do that, did you?
6229030	eng	I think Tom will be careful.
6229031	eng	That movie wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.
6229032	eng	I think Tom probably isn't as young as you think he is.
6229033	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to tell Tom to do that?
6229034	eng	I think Tom was unimpressed.
6229035	eng	Someone talked to me about this, but I don't remember who.
6229036	eng	I think Tom lived in Boston when he was in high school.
6229037	eng	We didn't know whether Tom would want to eat with us or not.
6229038	eng	I think Tom never does that.
6229039	eng	Mary is the only woman I've ever really been in love with.
6229040	eng	I think Tom knows he's supposed to give a speech today.
6229041	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he ought to do that?
6229042	eng	I think Tom might get fired.
6229043	eng	It's up to you to decide whether or not we should do that.
6229044	eng	I think Tom doesn't really have the courage to do that.
6229045	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom he needs to do that?
6229046	eng	I think Tom lives in Boston.
6229047	eng	It probably wouldn't have been fun to do that by yourself.
6229048	eng	I should've told Tom that he needed to be more careful.
6229049	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom about what happened?
6229050	eng	I think Tom is disappointed.
6229051	eng	It probably wouldn't be impossible to do that by yourself.
6229052	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I don't want to do that.
6229053	eng	Was it you who told Tom he wouldn't be permitted to do that?
6229054	eng	I think Tom is ambidextrous.
6229055	eng	It looked like you were just about to jump into the water.
6229056	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I don't need to do that.
6229057	eng	There's a good chance that Tom will be fired for doing that.
6229058	eng	I think Tom doesn't do that.
6229059	eng	If you're going to do that tomorrow, let's do it together.
6229060	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I don't have to do that.
6229061	eng	There's a good chance that Tom will be fined for doing that.
6229062	eng	I still have to talk to Tom.
6229063	eng	If you have the time, could you come to my office at 2:30?
6229065	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom ought to have done that.
6229066	eng	I still have a crush on Tom.
6229067	eng	If you ever feel like doing that, just go ahead and do it.
6229068	eng	I might be permitted to do that if Tom does it with me.
6229069	eng	Monday is the only day of the week that Tom doesn't do that.
6229070	eng	I stayed in Boston with Tom.
6229071	eng	If you don't want to do that, you don't have to, you know.
6229072	eng	I looked at the painting on the wall behind Tom's desk.
6229073	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's supposed to give a speech today.
6229074	eng	I should've danced with Tom.
6229075	eng	I'm surprised that I don't have to do what you have to do.
6229076	eng	I lied to Tom when I said I didn't know how to do that.
6229077	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that anymore.
6229078	eng	I should tell Tom the truth.
6229079	eng	I'm not the only one here who doesn't know how to do that.
6229080	eng	I immediately recognized Tom. He looks like his father.
6229081	eng	It'll probably be impossible for Tom to do that by himself.
6229082	eng	I should tell Tom I'm tired.
6229083	eng	I'd rather use a crowbar than a hammer to open this crate.
6229084	eng	I helped Tom because I wanted to, not because I had to.
6229085	eng	It would be very efficient to do that the way Tom suggested.
6229086	eng	I should tell Tom I'm sorry.
6229087	eng	I'd never be able to afford to buy a house on Park Street.
6229088	eng	I heard yesterday that Tom was in some kind of trouble.
6229089	eng	It would be a lot more fun to do that the way Tom suggested.
6229090	eng	I should ask Tom to do that.
6229091	eng	I'd like to do that as much as possible while I still can.
6229092	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be home on Monday.
6229093	eng	If I'd been there, I wouldn't have permitted Tom to do that.
6229094	eng	I saw Tom do that yesterday.
6229095	eng	I wish I hadn't tried driving home after drinking so much.
6229096	eng	I doubt that Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
6229097	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be absent if he weren't terribly sick.
6229098	eng	I saw Tom do that last week.
6229099	eng	I was surprised when you told me I didn't have to do that.
6229100	eng	I doubt if Tom will be present at the meeting tomorrow.
6229101	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be present at tomorrow morning's meeting.
6229102	eng	I never saw Tom on that day.
6229103	eng	I was surprised to find out that I didn't need to do that.
6229104	eng	I don't yet know if Tom will go camping with us or not.
6229105	eng	I'm probably the only person here who knows where Tom lives.
6229106	eng	I need to know where Tom is.
6229107	eng	I was surprised to find out that I didn't have to do that.
6229108	eng	I don't think we should do that the way Tom told us to.
6229109	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is the only one who has to do that.
6229110	eng	I know why Tom is terrified.
6229111	eng	I thought you said you were looking forward to doing that.
6229112	eng	I don't think Tom could've done that without some help.
6229113	eng	I wonder why Tom is pretending he doesn't understand French.
6229114	eng	I know why Tom is surprised.
6229115	eng	I know I don't have enough time to do what has to be done.
6229116	eng	I don't think I'll be able to talk Tom into doing that.
6229117	eng	I wish I'd spent more money on the present I bought for Tom.
6229118	eng	I know why Tom is in Boston.
6229119	eng	I know I don't have enough money to buy everything I want.
6229120	eng	I don't like speaking in French and Tom doesn't either.
6229121	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't want to do that with you.
6229122	eng	I know why Tom got confused.
6229123	eng	I know I don't have enough money to buy everything I need.
6229124	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to go to Boston with him.
6229125	eng	I was through doing that by the time Tom offered to help me.
6229126	eng	I know who killed Tom's dog.
6229127	eng	I get the feeling that I'm the only one who can't do that.
6229128	eng	I don't know who Tom thought was going to win the race.
6229129	eng	Tom Jackson said in a TV interview Monday that he didn't think his team would win another game this season.
6229130	eng	I know where Tom is staying.
6229131	eng	I don't think we should do that the way you're suggesting.
6229132	eng	I don't know whether Tom is younger or older than I am.
6229133	eng	Tom Jackson said in a telephone interview that he was confident that his team would win the series.
6229134	eng	I know what Tom wants to do.
6229135	eng	I don't think I'll be able to finish doing this by myself.
6229136	eng	I don't know whether I should go to Tom's party or not.
6229137	eng	Tom didn't know his parents because they both died in a traffic accident when he was still a baby.
6229138	eng	I know what Tom needs to do.
6229139	eng	I don't see how I can do everything I've been asked to do.
6229140	eng	I didn't think Tom would be up so early in the morning.
6229141	eng	Tom said nothing would make him happier than to spend the summer in Boston with his grandparents.
6229142	eng	I know that Tom is unafraid.
6229143	eng	I don't need to go to school next week if I don't want to.
6229144	eng	I didn't think Tom would be through doing that by 2:30.
6229145	eng	Tom and I recognized each other immediately even though we hadn't seen each other in a long time.
6229146	eng	I know that Tom is ticklish.
6229147	eng	I don't like to wait till the last minute to do something.
6229148	eng	I didn't think Tom would be present at today's meeting.
6229149	eng	Tom said he left early because his wife had called and there was some kind of emergency at home.
6229150	eng	I know that Tom is thrilled.
6229151	eng	I don't like being the one who always has to milk the cow.
6229152	eng	I didn't think Tom would be afraid of such a small dog.
6229153	eng	Tom is married now, so he can't go drinking every weekend with his friends the way he used to.
6229154	eng	I know that Tom is talented.
6229155	eng	I don't have to go to school next week if I don't want to.
6229156	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to do that by himself.
6229157	eng	Tom saw his name written on the blackboard and wondered why the teacher had written it there.
6229158	eng	I know that Tom is stubborn.
6229159	eng	I didn't want to get married, but my parents forced me to.
6229160	eng	I didn't think Tom really needed to do that by himself.
6229161	eng	Tom is married now, so he can't go drinking every weekend with his friends like he used to.
6229162	eng	I know that Tom is stranded.
6229163	eng	I didn't want anyone to see my painting until it was done.
6229164	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to go swimming with.
6229165	eng	Tom said that my parents wouldn't likely allow me to do that until I'm eighteen years old.
6229166	eng	I know that Tom is relieved.
6229167	eng	I didn't think there was any reason why we had to do that.
6229168	eng	I didn't know where Tom wanted me to put his suitcases.
6229169	eng	Tom Jackson said in an interview in Boston that he was going to retire after this season.
6229170	eng	I know that Tom is reliable.
6229171	eng	I didn't think that it would take so long time to do that.
6229172	eng	I didn't know what Tom was going to make for breakfast.
6229173	eng	Tom Jackson said in a recent phone interview that he wouldn't be playing in today's game.
6229174	eng	I know that Tom is reckless.
6229175	eng	I didn't think I'd ever get used to sleeping on the floor.
6229176	eng	I didn't know that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
6229177	eng	Tom says that my parents won't likely allow me to do that until I'm eighteen years old.
6229178	eng	I know that Tom is prepared.
6229179	eng	I didn't know you weren't supposed to do that by yourself.
6229180	eng	I didn't know that Tom was planning to go to Australia.
6229181	eng	Tom said three of his chickens were dead when he went out to collect eggs this morning.
6229182	eng	I know that Tom is outraged.
6229183	eng	I didn't know we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
6229184	eng	I didn't know that Tom was a still high school student.
6229185	eng	Tom said that my parents won't likely allow me to do that until I'm eighteen years old.
6229186	eng	I know that Tom is obedient.
6229187	eng	I didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that.
6229188	eng	I didn't know Tom shouldn't be doing what he was doing.
6229189	eng	Tom could've been present at today's meeting, but he didn't want to be, so he wasn't.
6229190	eng	I know that Tom is mistaken.
6229191	eng	I didn't know that what we were doing was against the law.
6229192	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom twice what needed to be done.
6229193	eng	Tom could've become an excellent surgeon, but instead became a mediocre psychologist.
6229194	eng	I know that Tom is insecure.
6229195	eng	I didn't know how to do that, but I tried to do it anyway.
6229196	eng	I didn't have to say anything. Tom did all the talking.
6229197	eng	Tom thinks that if he had done that earlier, he could've avoided a lot of problems.
6229198	eng	I know that Tom is innocent.
6229199	eng	I didn't know I was supposed to do that before I got here.
6229200	eng	I didn't have Tom's phone number, so I didn't call him.
6229201	eng	Tom said he was going to do that the day before yesterday, but he didn't have time.
6229202	eng	I know that Tom is homesick.
6229203	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy everything I had to buy.
6229204	eng	I didn't change my plans, even though Tom wanted me to.
6229205	eng	Tom's teacher called to say that Tom has been bullying a couple of kids at school.
6229206	eng	I know that Tom is homeless.
6229207	eng	I didn't find out I had been adopted until I was thirteen.
6229208	eng	I can't remember what Tom told me I was supposed to do.
6229209	eng	Tom opened his eyes and didn't immediately realize that he was in a hospital room.
6229210	eng	I know that Tom is handsome.
6229211	eng	I could hear the sound of a car pulling into the driveway.
6229212	eng	How much time do you estimate Tom will need to do that?
6229213	eng	Tom isn't patient enough to do something like that that requires so much patience.
6229214	eng	I know that Tom is friendly.
6229215	eng	I could hear children playing in the apartment above mine.
6229216	eng	How many months do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6229217	eng	Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened, but I don't think he was.
6229218	eng	I know that Tom is famished.
6229219	eng	How much more time do you think it'll take you to do that?
6229220	eng	Even though I told Tom he needed to do that, he didn't.
6229221	eng	Tom and three other students are staying after school to help clean the classroom.
6229222	eng	I know that Tom is divorced.
6229223	eng	How much more time do you estimate you'll need to do that?
6229224	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested wouldn't take as long.
6229225	eng	Tom will likely be depressed when he sees how much paperwork remains to be done.
6229226	eng	I know that Tom is diabetic.
6229227	eng	How many more years will it take you to finish doing that?
6229228	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested wouldn't cost as much.
6229229	eng	Tom just called me to tell me he'd be late because he's caught in a traffic jam.
6229230	eng	I know that Tom is creative.
6229231	eng	How many months do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6229232	eng	Do you think Tom would still be able to do that for us?
6229233	eng	Tom won't be able to do that by himself, so we need to ask someone to help him.
6229234	eng	I know that Tom is confused.
6229235	eng	How did you know what time the meeting was going to start?
6229236	eng	Do you think Tom could do that without getting injured?
6229237	eng	Tom won't be able to do that by himself, so we have to ask someone to help him.
6229238	eng	I know that Tom is bluffing.
6229239	eng	Don't forget that you have clothes in the washing machine.
6229240	eng	Didn't you know that Tom is an extremely gifted artist?
6229241	eng	Tom looked around the room to make sure that everything was where it should be.
6229242	eng	I know that Tom is autistic.
6229243	eng	Doing that wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.
6229244	eng	Didn't you know Tom was going to go to Boston tomorrow?
6229245	eng	Tom isn't married to the same woman he was married to that last time I met him.
6229246	eng	I know that Tom is artistic.
6229247	eng	Do you think I'll get there in time if I go there by taxi?
6229248	eng	Didn't you know Tom doesn't like watching sports on TV?
6229249	eng	Tom has been told to do that more than three times and he still hasn't done it.
6229250	eng	I know that Tom is arrogant.
6229251	eng	Do you still do that as many times a month as you used to?
6229252	eng	You're the only one who seems to know why Tom is here.
6229253	eng	Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened, but we don't think so.
6229254	eng	I know that Tom is annoying.
6229255	eng	Didn't you know that you were supposed to help me do that?
6229256	eng	You're not suggesting Tom could've done that, are you?
6229257	eng	Tom and I usually talked to each other in French when we were college students.
6229258	eng	I know Tom wants to do that.
6229259	eng	"Have you already done that?" "Yes, I did that yesterday."
6229260	eng	You're doing that because Tom told you to, aren't you?
6229261	eng	Tom's teacher called to say that Tom has been bullying some of his classmates.
6229262	eng	I know Tom needs to do that.
6229263	eng	You're the only one who won't be at the meeting tomorrow.
6229264	eng	You'd do that again if Tom asked you to, wouldn't you?
6229265	eng	Tom said that he wouldn't be allowed to do that until he's eighteen years old.
6229266	eng	I know Tom has been injured.
6229267	eng	You're the only one who can tell us what we need to know.
6229268	eng	You weren't able to convince Tom to do that, were you?
6229269	eng	Tom said his house was only about three miles from the school where he worked.
6229270	eng	I knew Tom would be shocked.
6229271	eng	You wouldn't be very interested in doing that, would you?
6229272	eng	You told Tom I didn't know how to do that, didn't you?
6229273	eng	Tom is able to understand French fairly well, but he doesn't speak it so well.
6229274	eng	I knew Tom would be annoyed.
6229275	eng	You weren't the only one who wanted to do that, were you?
6229276	eng	You told Tom I couldn't do that by myself, didn't you?
6229277	eng	Tom could've been finished doing that by now if he hadn't wasted so much time.
6229278	eng	I hope that Tom can do that.
6229279	eng	You weren't the only one who needed to do that, were you?
6229280	eng	You think that Tom is the one who did that, don't you?
6229281	eng	Tom and I got to know each other in Boston when we were both college students.
6229282	eng	I hope Tom knows what to do.
6229283	eng	You weren't the first one to decide to do that, were you?
6229284	eng	You think I could teach Tom how to do that, don't you?
6229285	eng	Tom Jackson said in an interview yesterday that he thought his team would win.
6229286	eng	I hope Tom isn't suspicious.
6229287	eng	You weren't surprised that I wanted to do that, were you?
6229288	eng	You think I could talk Tom into doing that, don't you?
6229289	eng	Tom could've been finished doing that by 2:30 if he'd worked a little faster.
6229290	eng	I hope Tom isn't prejudiced.
6229291	eng	You weren't surprised that I needed to do that, were you?
6229292	eng	You think I could stop Tom from doing that, don't you?
6229293	eng	Tom says he and his friends stayed after school to help clean the classroom.
6229294	eng	I hope Tom isn't handcuffed.
6229295	eng	You weren't convinced that I needed to do that, were you?
6229296	eng	You still don't know why Tom wants to do that, do you?
6229297	eng	Tom might've been lonely, but even if he had been, he wouldn't have told us.
6229298	eng	I hope Tom isn't frightened.
6229299	eng	You thought I was going to do that yesterday, didn't you?
6229300	eng	You still don't know why Tom needs to do that, do you?
6229301	eng	Tom says that he won't be allowed to do that until he's eighteen years old.
6229302	eng	I hope Tom isn't downstairs.
6229303	eng	You knew I was supposed to do that yesterday, didn't you?
6229304	eng	You shouldn't have done that without Tom's permission.
6229305	eng	Tom said that he won't be allowed to do that until he's eighteen years old.
6229306	eng	I hope Tom isn't doing that.
6229307	eng	You hope that you won't have to do that again, don't you?
6229308	eng	You should've been able to do that without Tom's help.
6229309	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that where he parked is reserved for police cars.
6229310	eng	I hope Tom isn't displeased.
6229311	eng	You didn't think I'd be the last one to do that, did you?
6229312	eng	You should probably tell Tom that he needs to do that.
6229313	eng	Tom said he regrets not studying French harder when he was in high school.
6229314	eng	I hope Tom is in Boston now.
6229315	eng	You didn't know you weren't supposed to do that, did you?
6229316	eng	You know that Tom was the one who did that, don't you?
6229317	eng	Tom is primarily the bass guitarist, but he sometimes sings backup vocals.
6229318	eng	I helped Tom write an essay.
6229319	eng	You didn't know that I was the one who did that, did you?
6229320	eng	You know Tom isn't likely to do that today, don't you?
6229321	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him where the party was going to be.
6229322	eng	I helped Tom out of the car.
6229323	eng	You didn't know that I had to do that by myself, did you?
6229324	eng	You knew that Tom wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6229325	eng	Tom didn't live long enough to see his children graduate from high school.
6229326	eng	I helped Tom move the piano.
6229327	eng	You didn't know I was supposed to do that today, did you?
6229328	eng	You hope I'm faster at doing that than Tom, don't you?
6229329	eng	Tom would like to do that, but unfortunately he doesn't have enough time.
6229330	eng	I helped Tom move the couch.
6229331	eng	You didn't know I was still planning to do that, did you?
6229332	eng	You don't seem to understand why Tom needs to do that.
6229333	eng	Tom said he'd do that for free if it didn't take longer than three hours.
6229334	eng	I helped Tom get in the car.
6229335	eng	You could've done that in a lot less time if you'd tried.
6229336	eng	You didn't think Tom would forget to do that, did you?
6229337	eng	Tom said he thought it would be impossible to do that before next Monday.
6229338	eng	I helped Tom get a job here.
6229339	eng	While you're waiting, why don't you have a cup of coffee?
6229340	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom hadn't done that.
6229341	eng	Tom has come back to Boston every summer since he graduated from college.
6229342	eng	I figured Tom could do that.
6229343	eng	What's the difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle?
6229344	eng	You didn't realize that Tom couldn't do that, did you?
6229345	eng	Tom could've gotten home by Monday evening if he hadn't missed his plane.
6229346	eng	I felt the same way Tom did.
6229347	eng	What was the most interesting book that you've ever read?
6229348	eng	You didn't realize I had to help Tom do that, did you?
6229349	eng	Tom won't likely be awake until after everyone else has eaten breakfast.
6229350	eng	I expect Tom to participate.
6229351	eng	What should we do while we're waiting for that to happen?
6229352	eng	You didn't know Tom thought I should do that, did you?
6229353	eng	Tom wants to know when you'll go to Boston and how long you'll be there.
6229354	eng	I drove Tom to the hospital.
6229355	eng	What kinds of things do you like to do with your friends?
6229356	eng	You didn't ask Tom for permission to do that, did you?
6229357	eng	Tom says he thinks it'll be impossible to do that without a lot of help.
6229358	eng	I doubt if Tom will do that.
6229359	eng	What kinds of things do you like to do in your free time?
6229360	eng	Why did you tell Tom I didn't have to do that anymore?
6229361	eng	Tom said it was time to start thinking about how we're going to do that.
6229362	eng	I doubt if Tom will be last.
6229363	eng	We've spoken French together since the first time we met.
6229364	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't want to go swimming with us?
6229365	eng	Tom said he wouldn't have done that if he'd thought it wasn't necessary.
6229366	eng	I doubt if Tom will be here.
6229367	eng	We've already decided that we'll go to Boston in October.
6229368	eng	What makes you think that I don't want Tom to do that?
6229369	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to study for today's French test.
6229370	eng	I don't want Tom to kiss me.
6229371	eng	We might not stay in Boston as long as we had planned to.
6229372	eng	What do you think Tom would've done in that situation?
6229373	eng	Tom probably hasn't figured out yet that he'll never be able to do that.
6229374	eng	I don't think Tom is stupid.
6229375	eng	We invited 30 people to our party. However, only 13 came.
6229376	eng	Were you with Tom when he slipped and fell on the ice?
6229377	eng	Tom isn't likely to be finished doing that before Monday afternoon.
6229378	eng	I don't think Tom is strong.
6229379	eng	We don't usually get a lot of visitors this time of year.
6229380	eng	We have to make sure that Tom doesn't do that anymore.
6229381	eng	Tom glanced at his watch and was surprised that it was already midnight.
6229382	eng	I don't think Tom is strict.
6229383	eng	We could come to Boston next weekend if you'd like us to.
6229384	eng	There's no chance that Tom will ever get here on time.
6229385	eng	Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened, but I doubt it.
6229386	eng	I don't think Tom is stingy.
6229387	eng	Unfortunately, I was busy yesterday and couldn't do that.
6229388	eng	The only one here who doesn't enjoy doing that is Tom.
6229389	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that unless it hadn't been absolutely necessary.
6229390	eng	I don't think Tom is sleepy.
6229391	eng	This book wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.
6229392	eng	The doctor said that Tom could die from the infection.
6229393	eng	Tom wouldn't have asked you for help if he could've done it by himself.
6229394	eng	I don't think Tom is skinny.
6229395	eng	There are several good reasons why you shouldn't do that.
6229396	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom wanted to do that.
6229397	eng	Tom thought he wouldn't be able to do that if he didn't have some help.
6229398	eng	I don't think Tom is single.
6229399	eng	That wine wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.
6229400	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom needed to do that.
6229401	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he would be able to do that without our help.
6229402	eng	I don't think Tom is scared.
6229403	eng	Pick as many apples as you want and put them in this box.
6229404	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that won't happen anytime soon.
6229405	eng	Tom could've been lonely, but even if he was, he wouldn't have told us.
6229406	eng	I don't think Tom is lonely.
6229407	eng	My parents weren't the ones who taught me how to do that.
6229408	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not likely to be punished.
6229409	eng	Tom and I run into each other at the supermarket several times a month.
6229410	eng	I don't think Tom is honest.
6229411	eng	My parents were murdered when I was only three years old.
6229412	eng	It would be more fun to do that the way Tom suggested.
6229413	eng	Tom and I plan to get married as soon as we both graduate from college.
6229414	eng	I don't think Tom is guilty.
6229415	eng	My parents taught me to skate when I was three years old.
6229416	eng	It would be better if Tom stayed with his grandmother.
6229417	eng	Tom wouldn't have asked you to do that if he could've done it himself.
6229418	eng	I don't think Tom is asleep.
6229419	eng	It probably wouldn't be dangerous to do that by yourself.
6229420	eng	Isn't there a chance that Tom is doing that right now?
6229421	eng	Tom would like to do that, but unfortunately he doesn't have the time.
6229422	eng	I don't think Tom is afraid.
6229423	eng	If you did that yesterday, you don't need to do it today.
6229424	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be here if he didn't have to be.
6229425	eng	Tom will be grumpy all day, since he didn't get much sleep last night.
6229426	eng	I don't think Tom is absent.
6229427	eng	I've already spent three times as much money as you have.
6229428	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be cold. He's wearing a heavy coat.
6229429	eng	Tom turned off the living room light and went upstairs to his bedroom.
6229430	eng	I don't think Tom does that.
6229431	eng	I'll arrange to get that done before the end of the week.
6229432	eng	I'm sure Tom wants to do that just as badly as you do.
6229433	eng	Tom should be able to do something as simple as that without any help.
6229434	eng	I don't like Tom's attitude.
6229435	eng	I'd rather wear ugly clothes than wear no clothes at all.
6229436	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be in Boston next Monday.
6229437	eng	Tom sat on a stool surround by his grandchildren sitting on the floor.
6229438	eng	I don't like Tom doing that.
6229439	eng	I skipped lunch because I didn't have enough time to eat.
6229440	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be at tomorrow's meeting.
6229441	eng	Tom put all his money in the box and hid it in the back of his closet.
6229442	eng	I don't know why Tom is sad.
6229443	eng	I play soccer better than tennis, but I like tennis more.
6229444	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom is the only one who can't do that.
6229445	eng	Tom just called me to tell me he'd be late because he has a flat tire.
6229446	eng	I don't know what Tom needs.
6229447	eng	I often ask questions that I already know the answers to.
6229448	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if Tom wanted to go to Boston.
6229449	eng	Tom had his secretary buy his wife the birthday gift that he gave her.
6229450	eng	I don't know what Tom meant.
6229451	eng	I looked around for my glasses, but I couldn't find them.
6229452	eng	I wonder if there's any possibility of Tom doing that.
6229453	eng	Tom doesn't like being the one who always has to take out the garbage.
6229454	eng	I don't know what Tom likes.
6229455	eng	I liked studying French when I was a high school student.
6229456	eng	I wish you hadn't told Tom that I knew how to do that.
6229457	eng	Tom could've been interested, but he didn't seem to show any interest.
6229458	eng	I don't help Tom very often.
6229459	eng	I hope you can understand why I'm not willing to do that.
6229460	eng	I wish I'd spent more money on the gift I gave to Tom.
6229461	eng	Tom and I have been working on this project for the last three months.
6229462	eng	I don't care what Tom wears.
6229463	eng	I finished writing the article and sent it to the editor.
6229464	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to do that.
6229465	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him where the party was going to be.
6229466	eng	I didn't want to let Tom go.
6229467	eng	I expect all three of you to do the same thing I'm doing.
6229468	eng	I went on doing that even though Tom asked me to stop.
6229469	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't feel like doing that.
6229470	eng	I didn't want to bother Tom.
6229471	eng	I don't want to live in Boston for more than three years.
6229472	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me what had happened.
6229473	eng	Tom said that he wasn't able to read anything without his glasses on.
6229474	eng	I didn't want Tom to suffer.
6229475	eng	I don't think we should do that the way you've suggested.
6229476	eng	I waited for Tom all afternoon, but he didn't show up.
6229477	eng	Tom realized he wouldn't likely be able to do that without some help.
6229478	eng	I didn't think Tom was last.
6229479	eng	I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
6229480	eng	I used to work at the same bakery where Tom works now.
6229481	eng	Tom probably hasn't figured out yet that he won't be able to do that.
6229482	eng	I didn't think Tom was here.
6229483	eng	I don't think I can afford to buy the kind of car I want.
6229484	eng	I told Tom that I thought we might be able to do that.
6229485	eng	Tom probably doesn't have enough time to do that before he goes home.
6229486	eng	I didn't think Tom was busy.
6229487	eng	I don't like living in Boston and my wife doesn't either.
6229488	eng	I told Tom that I thought he might be able to do that.
6229489	eng	Tom has been accused of setting fire to one of the buildings he owns.
6229490	eng	I didn't think Tom did that.
6229491	eng	I don't have to get up as early tomorrow as I usually do.
6229492	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think I'd be able to do that.
6229493	eng	Tom and I study at the same university, but in different departments.
6229494	eng	I didn't tell Tom your name.
6229495	eng	I didn't want to admit that I didn't know how to do that.
6229496	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have anything pressing to do.
6229497	eng	Tom and I sat on a bench in the park and talked while we fed pigeons.
6229498	eng	I didn't tell Tom the truth.
6229499	eng	I didn't think you'd be awake when I got home last night.
6229500	eng	I told Tom I thought it would be dangerous to do that.
6229501	eng	Tom wouldn't have asked you to do that if he didn't think you could.
6229502	eng	I didn't tell Tom about you.
6229503	eng	I didn't think you'd be able to do that without any help.
6229504	eng	I thought you said you wanted Tom to do that with you.
6229505	eng	Tom was the only other guy who said he was interested in doing that.
6229506	eng	I didn't notice Tom leaving.
6229507	eng	I didn't see anyone else waiting in front of the station.
6229509	eng	Tom was one of the few people who escaped from the burning building.
6229510	eng	I didn't intend to hurt Tom.
6229511	eng	I didn't know we were supposed to do that this afternoon.
6229512	eng	I thought Tom said he didn't know how use a chain saw.
6229513	eng	Tom usually goes to school by bus, but sometimes he goes by bicycle.
6229514	eng	I didn't help Tom very much.
6229515	eng	I didn't do that because I didn't think it was necessary.
6229516	eng	I thought Tom might not be permitted to do that today.
6229517	eng	Tom thought he should say something, but he didn't know what to say.
6229518	eng	I didn't get into Tom's car.
6229519	eng	I didn't do that as well as I thought I would be able to.
6229520	eng	I think you should try to persuade Tom not to do that.
6229521	eng	Tom survived for three years on a small island in the Pacific Ocean.
6229522	eng	I didn't eat lunch with Tom.
6229523	eng	I couldn't go to the concert, because my mother was sick.
6229524	eng	I think that perhaps Tom has forgotten how to do that.
6229525	eng	Tom said the scenery was more beautiful than he thought it would be.
6229526	eng	I can't wait to talk to Tom.
6229527	eng	How much more time do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6229528	eng	I think Tom would like to be the first one to do that.
6229529	eng	Tom said it's important that we do what we can to help John do that.
6229530	eng	I can't tell Tom what to do.
6229531	eng	How many weeks do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6229532	eng	I think Tom would like nothing better than to do that.
6229533	eng	Tom said he's glad you were able to do that when you were in Boston.
6229534	eng	I can't swim as well as Tom.
6229535	eng	How many hours do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6229536	eng	I think Tom will be able to help us do that next week.
6229537	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why you didn't do what you said you'd do.
6229538	eng	I can't swim as fast as Tom.
6229539	eng	Have you made up your mind whether you'll do that or not?
6229540	eng	I think Tom probably isn't as rich as you think he is.
6229541	eng	Tom said he thought he would be able to do that if he had some help.
6229542	eng	I can't sing as well as Tom.
6229543	eng	Has anyone ever accused you of being a pathological liar?
6229544	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I'm not going to do that.
6229545	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6229546	eng	I can tell Tom if I want to.
6229547	eng	Didn't you know what time the meeting was going to start?
6229548	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I didn't want to do that.
6229549	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that before she can go home.
6229550	eng	I assumed Tom would do that.
6229551	eng	"Is it OK if I don't do that?" "No, you have to do that."
6229552	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I didn't need to do that.
6229553	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know who's living in the house next to his.
6229554	eng	I asked Tom why he did that.
6229555	eng	You're the only one who doesn't seem to want to be here.
6229556	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I didn't have to do that.
6229557	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's supposed to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6229558	eng	I asked Tom to speak French.
6229559	eng	You're the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.
6229560	eng	I should've told Tom why it was a bad idea to do that.
6229561	eng	Tom may understand French fairly well, but doesn't speak it so well.
6229562	eng	I already know what Tom did.
6229563	eng	You're the first person who has ever offered to help me.
6229564	eng	I should probably tell Tom that I want him to do that.
6229565	eng	Tom knows he's supposed to pay his rent on the first of every month.
6229566	eng	How will Tom come to Boston?
6229567	eng	You're probably the only person who can help us do that.
6229568	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I want to do that.
6229569	eng	Tom knew he needed to say something, but he didn't know what to say.
6229570	eng	How often does Tom get sick?
6229571	eng	You're probably the only person who can help me do that.
6229572	eng	I reminded Tom that he needed to have his oil changed.
6229573	eng	Tom doesn't know who he should ask to help him figure out his taxes.
6229574	eng	How is Tom coming to Boston?
6229575	eng	You'd be disappointed if I didn't do that, wouldn't you?
6229576	eng	I know I don't have to do anything Tom tells me to do.
6229577	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him he didn't need to do that.
6229578	eng	Has Tom ever visited Boston?
6229579	eng	You wouldn't have been able to do that without our help.
6229580	eng	I just can't believe Tom would do something like that.
6229581	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him he didn't have to do that.
6229582	eng	Has Tom ever studied French?
6229583	eng	You weren't the only one permitted to do that, were you?
6229584	eng	I finally found the courage to ask Tom not to do that.
6229585	eng	Tom didn't know how to do that, but he was willing to give it a try.
6229586	eng	Has Tom ever gone to Boston?
6229587	eng	You taught French for a few years in Boston, didn't you?
6229588	eng	I feel sorry for Tom because he always has to do that.
6229589	eng	Tom can understand French fairly well, but doesn't speak it so well.
6229590	eng	Don't permit Tom to do that.
6229591	eng	You suggested that we do that tomorrow instead of today.
6229592	eng	I doubt if Tom would do that if he were in your shoes.
6229593	eng	Tom and I've been discussing the situation for the past three hours.
6229594	eng	Don't expect Tom to do that.
6229595	eng	You should clean your room before your mother gets home.
6229596	eng	I don't think Tom's French pronunciation is very good.
6229597	eng	Tom would be here doing that now if he didn't have to be in Boston.
6229598	eng	Does Tom work in Boston, too?
6229599	eng	You never expected to be able to do that again, did you?
6229600	eng	I don't think Tom will have the time to do that today.
6229601	eng	Tom said it was time to start thinking about what we needed to buy.
6229602	eng	Does Tom still teach French?
6229603	eng	You look like you're too tired to do anything right now.
6229604	eng	I don't think Tom will be finished doing that by 2:30.
6229605	eng	Tom said his house was only about three miles from where he worked.
6229606	eng	Does Tom go to Boston often?
6229607	eng	You look just like your father did when he was your age.
6229608	eng	I don't think Tom will be difficult to get along with.
6229609	eng	Tom said he wants to be able to speak French like a native speaker.
6229610	eng	Do you think Tom is serious?
6229611	eng	You know I'm not supposed to do that anymore, don't you?
6229612	eng	I don't think Tom is the kind of person who'd do that.
6229613	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
6229614	eng	Do you know why Tom was mad?
6229615	eng	You know I'll never be able to do that again, don't you?
6229616	eng	I don't think Tom is glad that that's going to happen.
6229617	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who wanted to do that.
6229618	eng	Do you know why Tom is late?
6229619	eng	You haven't had many opportunities to do that, have you?
6229620	eng	I don't need to tell Tom what to do. He already knows.
6229621	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needed to do that.
6229622	eng	Did you know Tom was hungry?
6229623	eng	You don't think I'll be the last one to do that, do you?
6229624	eng	I don't know whether Tom will agree to do that or not.
6229625	eng	Tom probably just didn't know what time he was supposed to be here.
6229626	eng	Did you know Tom was asleep?
6229627	eng	You don't know whether I need to do that or not, do you?
6229628	eng	I don't know whether Tom is good at doing that or not.
6229629	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know he'll never be able to do that again.
6229630	eng	Did Tom come to Boston as well?
6229631	eng	You didn't think I'd be doing that for so long, did you?
6229632	eng	I don't believe that Tom would do something like that.
6229633	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to do that as well as most people do.
6229634	eng	Can Tom really teach French?
6229635	eng	You didn't think I was finished doing that yet, did you?
6229636	eng	I didn't want to say anything that might make Tom cry.
6229637	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him I didn't want to do that.
6229638	eng	Can I visit Boston with Tom?
6229639	eng	You didn't like to do that when you were a kid, did you?
6229640	eng	I didn't think Tom would be drunk so early in the day.
6229641	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him I didn't need to do that.
6229642	eng	Ask Tom what he wants to do.
6229643	eng	You didn't know that I needed to do that today, did you?
6229644	eng	I didn't tell Tom that what we were doing was illegal.
6229645	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him I didn't have to do that.
6229646	eng	Ask Tom if he needs my help.
6229647	eng	You didn't do that as much last month as you usually do.
6229648	eng	I didn't really feel like going out drinking with Tom.
6229649	eng	Tom could save himself a lot of trouble by just doing that himself.
6229650	eng	"Who was there?" "Only Tom."
6229651	eng	You broke your arm when you were a teenager, didn't you?
6229652	eng	I didn't realize Tom was going to have to leave early.
6229653	eng	Tom and I were very good friends when we were in elementary school.
6229654	eng	You look a little like Tom.
6229655	eng	You and I both know what'll happen if you don't do that.
6229656	eng	I didn't notice Tom sitting by himself at the counter.
6229657	eng	Tom will be going to the zoo with his children tomorrow afternoon.
6229658	eng	You don't need to tell Tom.
6229659	eng	Yesterday, I didn't wake up until late in the afternoon.
6229660	eng	I didn't need to tell Tom what to do. He already knew.
6229661	eng	Tom was afraid that people were going to say bad things about him.
6229662	eng	You could see Tom tomorrow.
6229663	eng	What kinds of TV programs do you watch with your family?
6229664	eng	I didn't know why Tom needed to borrow thirty dollars.
6229665	eng	Tom spent a lot of time reading books when he was in the hospital.
6229666	eng	Would you buy that for Tom?
6229667	eng	Were there any zebras in the zoo you went to last month?
6229668	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to go fishing with.
6229669	eng	Tom seemed to be very interested in everything that was happening.
6229670	eng	Why's Tom coming to Boston?
6229671	eng	We shouldn't let other people know that we've done that.
6229672	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to go camping with.
6229673	eng	Tom says he doesn't think that we should even consider doing that.
6229674	eng	Why won't Tom go to Boston?
6229675	eng	We may need to be in Boston for longer than we expected.
6229676	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was good at swimming or not.
6229677	eng	Tom says he doesn't remember people's names as well as he used to.
6229678	eng	Why did Tom stay in Boston?
6229679	eng	We could stay in Boston for a few more days if you like.
6229680	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was going to do that or not.
6229681	eng	Tom said this isn't the first time his license has been suspended.
6229682	eng	Why did Tom do that to you?
6229683	eng	Sometimes we speak French, but we usually speak English.
6229684	eng	I didn't know whether Tom wanted me to do that or not.
6229685	eng	Tom said that he wasn't able to read anything without his glasses.
6229686	eng	Who went shopping with Tom?
6229687	eng	Please don't come here by car. There's no place to park.
6229688	eng	I didn't know where Tom wanted me to put his suitcase.
6229689	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6229690	eng	Who else did that with Tom?
6229691	eng	My parents taught me to swim when I was three years old.
6229692	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom why because he already knew.
6229693	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who wants to do that.
6229694	eng	Where did Tom study French?
6229695	eng	Monday is the only day of the week that I don't do that.
6229696	eng	I didn't expect Tom to finish his homework so quickly.
6229697	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needs to do that.
6229698	eng	When does Tom walk his dog?
6229699	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be interesting to do that by yourself.
6229700	eng	I asked Tom whether he wanted to go to Boston with me.
6229701	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know how much time he'll have to do that.
6229702	eng	When did Tom break his leg?
6229703	eng	Mary and her husband are coming over for dinner tonight.
6229704	eng	I already know that Tom doesn't plan to be here today.
6229705	eng	Tom knows he isn't likely to finish painting his house in one day.
6229706	eng	What you said made Tom mad.
6229707	eng	Many people think that fast food is bad for your health.
6229708	eng	I admitted to Tom that I didn't know what I was doing.
6229709	eng	Tom isn't likely to be present at the meeting this afternoon.
6229710	eng	What you said made Tom cry.
6229711	eng	It would probably be interesting to do that by yourself.
6229712	eng	How many years will it take Tom to finish high school?
6229713	eng	Tom doesn't seem to have decided yet whether he'll do that or not.
6229714	eng	What does Tom intend to do?
6229715	eng	It took me a little more time than usual to fall asleep.
6229716	eng	How many weeks do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6229717	eng	Tom didn't know that you were the one who was supposed to do that.
6229718	eng	What did you learn from Tom?
6229719	eng	It took me a little longer than usual to get here today.
6229720	eng	How many times do you think Tom will do that tomorrow?
6229721	eng	Tom and I wanted to be together all the time when we were younger.
6229722	eng	What color is Tom's jacket?
6229723	eng	It probably wouldn't be possible to do that by yourself.
6229724	eng	How many months do you think Tom has spent doing that?
6229725	eng	Tom and I sat on the beach and talked to each other all afternoon.
6229726	eng	We want Tom to sing for us.
6229727	eng	It probably would've been unsafe to do that by yourself.
6229728	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6229729	eng	Tom's three favorite things are chocolate, computers and guitars.
6229730	eng	We didn't do that with Tom.
6229731	eng	It looked like you were just about to jump off the dock.
6229732	eng	How long do you think Tom has spent doing that so far?
6229733	eng	Tom seems to be unconvinced that doing that would be a good idea.
6229734	eng	Those are Tom's sunglasses.
6229735	eng	It doesn't matter when you do that as long as you do it.
6229736	eng	How did you know what time to meet Tom at the airport?
6229737	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe you're really considering doing that.
6229738	eng	They say that Tom did that.
6229739	eng	If you're feeling bad, maybe you should go see a doctor.
6229740	eng	Do you think Tom would be reluctant to do that for us?
6229741	eng	Tom said there were still a lot of things that needed to be done.
6229742	eng	These things belong to Tom.
6229743	eng	If it hadn't been raining yesterday, I'd have done that.
6229744	eng	Do you think Tom might be just a little too impatient?
6229745	eng	Tom said the picnic wasn't as much fun as he thought it would be.
6229746	eng	These glasses aren't Tom's.
6229747	eng	I've found a pretty good new restaurant near the office.
6229748	eng	Do you think Tom could do that without getting killed?
6229749	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't enjoy doing that.
6229750	eng	These are Tom's sunglasses.
6229751	eng	I'm the only one who can tell you what you need to know.
6229752	eng	Do you think Tom can do that in less than three hours?
6229753	eng	Tom said it was time to start thinking about what we need to buy.
6229754	eng	That car is probably Tom's.
6229755	eng	I'm not the only one who doesn't really want to be here.
6229756	eng	Do you know anything about the movie Tom wants to see?
6229757	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to do that until October.
6229758	eng	Tell Tom to stay in Boston.
6229759	eng	I'd understand it if you didn't want to do that with me.
6229760	eng	Didn't you know that Tom and I often do that together?
6229761	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6229762	eng	Tell Tom to get here early.
6229763	eng	I'd be very disappointed if you didn't come to my party.
6229764	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still living with his parents?
6229765	eng	Tom probably doesn't have enough time to finish doing that today.
6229766	eng	Tell Tom to come to Boston.
6229767	eng	I wouldn't wear that ugly coat even if I were very cold.
6229768	eng	Didn't you know Tom often wears a hat just like yours?
6229769	eng	Tom knew he should say something, but he didn't know what to say.
6229770	eng	Tell Tom he should do that.
6229771	eng	I won't be able to move this bookcase without some help.
6229772	eng	Did you tell Tom I didn't want him to do that anymore?
6229773	eng	Tom is the only person I know who's likely to be able to do that.
6229774	eng	Tell Tom he has to do that.
6229775	eng	I wish you would stay in Boston for another week or two.
6229776	eng	Did you know that Tom said he wasn't going to do that?
6229777	eng	Tom is the only person I know who doesn't like watching football.
6229778	eng	Tell Tom I need to do that.
6229779	fra	Elle fait tourner les têtes.
6229780	fra	Il a une moustache à la Brassens.
6229781	vie	Tôm không có súng.
6229782	vie	Tom lấy cuốn sách ở trên giá
6229783	eng	I wanted to go to Boston, but my father wouldn't let me.
6229784	eng	Did you know that Tom lived in Boston for three years?
6229785	vie	Việc đó nằm ngoài kế hoạch
6229786	eng	Tom has been accused of setting fire to one of his own buildings.
6229787	eng	Shouldn't Tom go to Boston?
6229788	eng	I wanted to go outside and play with the other children.
6229789	eng	Are you going to let Tom leave without saying goodbye?
6229790	eng	Tom either wears a gray suit or dark blue suit to work every day.
6229791	eng	Possibly Tom won't do that.
6229792	eng	I wanted to do that last week, but didn't have the time.
6229793	eng	All three of Tom's brothers have spent time in prison.
6229794	eng	Tom doesn't like being the one who always has to wash the dishes.
6229795	eng	Please tell Tom to do that.
6229796	eng	I want to know who you gave your old washing machine to.
6229797	eng	You'll try to persuade Tom not to do that, won't you?
6229798	eng	Tom didn't start playing the violin until he was thirty year old.
6229799	eng	Perhaps Tom won't buy that.
6229800	eng	I want to be able to speak French like a native speaker.
6229801	eng	You'll try to convince Tom not to do that, won't you?
6229802	eng	Tom didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
6229803	eng	My office is next to Tom's.
6229804	eng	I thought I was going to make a lot of money doing that.
6229805	eng	You'll help Tom do that if he asks you to, won't you?
6229806	eng	Tom and I lived in the same apartment building for several years.
6229807	eng	Maybe Tom wants to do that.
6229808	eng	I thought I was going to earn a lot of money doing that.
6229809	eng	You'd never do that the way Tom suggested, would you?
6229810	eng	Tom and I go fishing together almost every weekend in the summer.
6229811	eng	Maybe Tom can teach French.
6229812	eng	I think it would be safe for you to do that by yourself.
6229813	eng	You weren't the one who helped Tom do that, were you?
6229814	eng	Tom will be very disappointed if doesn't pass his driver's test.
6229815	eng	Maybe Tom can speak French.
6229816	eng	I still have to go to Boston three more times this year.
6229817	eng	You were the one who helped Tom do that, weren't you?
6229818	eng	Tom used to do that quite often, but he doesn't do that anymore.
6229819	eng	Let Tom read what he wants.
6229820	eng	I get the feeling that I'm the only one who can do that.
6229821	eng	You tried to convince Tom not to do that, didn't you?
6229822	eng	Tom told me that he was proud of his children's accomplishments.
6229823	eng	Let Tom have what he wants.
6229825	eng	You think Tom wouldn't be able to do that, don't you?
6229826	eng	Tom told me that he thought I might be interested in doing that.
6229827	eng	It looks like Tom is tired.
6229828	eng	I don't think that doing that would be such a good idea.
6229829	eng	You should probably tell Tom you're going to do that.
6229830	eng	Tom told me that I should be finished doing that by next Monday.
6229831	eng	Is Tom afraid of something?
6229832	eng	I don't think that doing that would be a very good idea.
6229833	eng	You should probably tell Tom you won't do that again.
6229834	eng	Tom shouldn't have hired a babysitter who couldn't speak French.
6229835	eng	I've warned Tom about that.
6229836	eng	I don't think I can do everything I've been asked to do.
6229837	eng	You seemed surprised that Tom wasn't able to do that.
6229838	eng	Tom says he isn't sure if he can do that, but he says he'll try.
6229839	eng	I've helped Tom many times.
6229840	eng	I don't like it when a woman wearing lipstick kisses me.
6229841	eng	You seem to be trying to get Tom to help you do that.
6229842	eng	Tom says he doesn't have the time or the inclination to do that.
6229843	eng	I'm sure that Tom did that.
6229844	eng	I don't know any girls who are more beautiful than Mary.
6229845	eng	You never expected Tom to refuse to do that, did you?
6229846	eng	Tom said that he's been wanting to visit Boston for a long time.
6229847	eng	I'm sure Tom would do that.
6229848	eng	I don't get the chance to do that as often as I used to.
6229849	eng	You know that Tom shouldn't be doing that, don't you?
6229850	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't want to do that.
6229852	eng	I don't feel like taking my dog for a walk this morning.
6229853	eng	You know that Tom is the one who did that, don't you?
6229854	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't need to do that.
6229855	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be home.
6229856	eng	I didn't want to get married until I was in my thirties.
6229857	eng	You know I wouldn't permit Tom to do that, don't you?
6229858	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't like doing that.
6229859	eng	I'm sure Tom will be upset.
6229860	eng	I didn't want to come to Boston, but my parents made me.
6229861	eng	You knew that Tom didn't want to do that, didn't you?
6229862	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who didn't have to do that.
6229863	eng	I'm sure Tom will be tired.
6229864	eng	I didn't notice I wasn't wearing my hat till I got home.
6229865	eng	You knew that Tom didn't need to do that, didn't you?
6229866	eng	Tom said that he doesn't think he could ever do that by himself.
6229867	eng	I'm sure Tom will be ready.
6229868	eng	I didn't know there was a prison so close to your house.
6229869	eng	You knew that Tom didn't like doing that, didn't you?
6229870	eng	Tom said he would've done that if he'd thought it was necessary.
6229871	eng	I'm sure Tom will be early.
6229872	eng	I didn't know it was possible to borrow that much money.
6229873	eng	You knew that Tom didn't have to do that, didn't you?
6229874	eng	Tom said he would've done that if he'd known he was supposed to.
6229875	eng	I'm sure Tom will be bored.
6229876	eng	I didn't get paid as much as they told me they'd pay me.
6229877	eng	You knew Tom couldn't do that by himself, didn't you?
6229878	eng	Tom said he wasn't in good enough shape to go mountain climbing.
6229879	eng	I'm sure Tom will be awake.
6229880	eng	I didn't figure out how to do that until just yesterday.
6229881	eng	You hope that Tom will be able to do that, don't you?
6229882	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that if he had some help.
6229883	eng	I'm sure Tom will be alone.
6229884	eng	I didn't expect to sell my old guitar for so much money.
6229885	eng	You haven't told Tom why I want to do that, have you?
6229886	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to do that anytime soon.
6229887	eng	I'm not sure what Tom said.
6229888	eng	I didn't do that yesterday because I had a bad headache.
6229889	eng	You haven't told Tom why I need to do that, have you?
6229890	eng	Tom said he thought he was the only one who knew how to do that.
6229891	eng	I'm glad that Tom did that.
6229892	eng	I didn't begin to play the saxophone until I was thirty.
6229893	eng	You haven't told Tom why I have to do that, have you?
6229894	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be required to do that anymore.
6229895	eng	I'll visit Boston with Tom.
6229896	eng	I could be in Boston next week if it's really necessary.
6229897	eng	You have to make sure that Tom doesn't do that again.
6229898	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who has to do that.
6229899	eng	I'll never stop loving Tom.
6229900	eng	How much time do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6229901	eng	You didn't tell Tom why I wanted to do that, did you?
6229902	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who had to do that.
6229903	eng	I'd never buy that for Tom.
6229904	eng	How much more time do you estimate is needed to do that?
6229905	eng	You didn't tell Tom why I needed to do that, did you?
6229906	eng	Tom said he thought he might be permitted to do that by himself.
6229907	eng	I wouldn't do that for Tom.
6229908	eng	How many times have I told you I'm not going to do that?
6229909	eng	You didn't know Tom wasn't going to do that, did you?
6229910	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be required to do that by himself.
6229911	eng	I wonder if Tom will be OK.
6229912	eng	How many more years do you think you'll want to do that?
6229913	eng	You didn't know Tom was supposed to do that, did you?
6229914	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be permitted to do that at school.
6229915	eng	I wonder if Tom is thirsty.
6229916	eng	How many more years do you think you'll need to do that?
6229917	eng	You didn't have Tom's permission to do that, did you?
6229918	eng	Tom said he didn't think he'd have enough time to do that today.
6229919	eng	I wonder if Tom is sincere.
6229920	eng	How many more years do you think you'll have to do that?
6229921	eng	You could go to Boston and spend the summer with Tom.
6229922	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who's living in the house next to his.
6229923	eng	I wonder if Tom is serious.
6229924	eng	How many minutes do you think it'll take you to do that?
6229925	eng	You asked Tom to show you how to do that, didn't you?
6229926	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who he should ask to help him do that.
6229927	eng	I wonder if Tom is puzzled.
6229928	eng	How many days do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6229929	eng	Why did you tell Tom that I didn't intend to do that?
6229930	eng	Tom plans to go to the post office while I'm in the supermarket.
6229931	eng	I wonder if Tom is pleased.
6229932	eng	Doing that the way you're suggesting would be dangerous.
6229933	eng	When I first met Tom, I didn't know that he was rich.
6229934	eng	Tom opened his eyes and realized that he was in a hospital room.
6229935	eng	I wonder if Tom is outside.
6229936	eng	Do you have a good relationship with your mother-in-law?
6229937	eng	We have to cross a toll bridge to get to Tom's house.
6229938	eng	Tom is still driving the same car he had when he was in college.
6229939	eng	I wonder if Tom is nervous.
6229940	eng	Did you know that we were supposed to do that yesterday?
6229941	eng	This afternoon, I'll be at the hospital visiting Tom.
6229942	eng	Tom invited me to stay a couple of weeks at his place in Boston.
6229943	eng	I wonder if Tom is married.
6229944	eng	Your gate was locked, so I thought you weren't at home.
6229945	eng	The police said they wouldn't stop searching for Tom.
6229946	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he isn't supposed to do that.
6229947	eng	I wonder if Tom is jealous.
6229948	eng	You're the only person I know who can probably do that.
6229949	eng	The only one here who doesn't want to do that is Tom.
6229950	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he wasn't supposed to do that.
6229951	eng	I wonder if Tom is healthy.
6229952	eng	You're the only one who volunteered to help us do that.
6229953	eng	The only one here who doesn't need to do that is Tom.
6229954	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him why we should do that.
6229955	eng	I wonder if Tom is excited.
6229956	eng	You're likely the only person who knows how to do that.
6229957	eng	The only one here who doesn't like doing that is Tom.
6229958	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him why we had to do that.
6229959	eng	I wonder if Tom is curious.
6229960	eng	You were a waiter when you were a student, weren't you?
6229961	eng	The only one here who doesn't have to do that is Tom.
6229962	eng	Tom didn't know that he was the one who was supposed to do that.
6229963	eng	I wonder if Tom is correct.
6229964	eng	You never thought you'd need to do that again, did you?
6229965	eng	The last time Tom went to Boston was three years ago.
6229966	eng	Tom didn't know how much money he would need for a down payment.
6229967	eng	I wonder if Tom is bipolar.
6229968	eng	You never thought you'd have to do that again, did you?
6229969	eng	The first time Tom did that was when he was thirteen.
6229970	eng	Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
6229971	eng	I wonder if Tom is annoyed.
6229972	eng	You know that I'm still planning to do that, don't you?
6229973	eng	Please tell Tom not to do that when we're not around.
6229974	eng	Tom and his driving instructor were both killed in the accident.
6229975	eng	I wonder if Tom is adopted.
6229976	eng	You didn't think you would be able to do that, did you?
6229977	eng	Please tell Tom he has to do that sometime this week.
6229978	eng	Tom and I sat on the doorstep talking to each other all morning.
6229980	eng	You didn't really think I'd refuse to do that, did you?
6229981	eng	Please tell Tom I need to do that sometime this week.
6229982	eng	Tom and I haven't seen each other since we were in grade school.
6229983	eng	I won't ask Tom to do that.
6229984	eng	You didn't know that I wasn't able to do that, did you?
6229985	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know who can do that and who can't.
6229986	eng	Tom used to do that frequently, but he doesn't do that anymore.
6229987	eng	I was going to talk to Tom.
6229988	eng	You didn't know that I didn't want to do that, did you?
6229989	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly what needs to be done.
6229990	eng	Tom spent the last years of his life writing his autobiography.
6229991	eng	I want to help Tom do that.
6229992	eng	You didn't know that I didn't need to do that, did you?
6229993	eng	It would be cheaper to do that the way Tom suggested.
6229994	eng	Tom should've been exhausted after chopping that much firewood.
6229995	eng	I want to do that with Tom.
6229996	eng	You didn't know that I didn't have to do that, did you?
6229997	eng	It looks like Tom will do what we've asked him to do.
6229998	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him he didn't need to do that.
6229999	eng	I want Tom to study French.
6230000	eng	You didn't know I no longer needed to do that, did you?
6230001	eng	It doesn't matter to me whether Tom does that or not.
6230002	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him he didn't have to do that.
6230003	eng	I told Tom to visit Boston.
6230004	eng	You didn't have to come here. You could've just called.
6230005	eng	Is it true that you and Tom stayed in the same hotel?
6230006	eng	Tom says that he doesn't feel like doing that because it's hot.
6230007	eng	I thought Tom would be shy.
6230008	eng	You didn't have the time to do that yesterday, did you?
6230009	eng	If Tom isn't careful, he's going to run out of money.
6230010	eng	Tom says he still doesn't understand why you'd want to do that.
6230011	eng	I thought Tom wasn't tired.
6230012	eng	What you're planning to do is likely to get you killed.
6230013	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be able to do that as fast as you.
6230014	eng	Tom said that he's wanted to learn how to swim for a long time.
6230015	eng	I thought Tom wasn't happy.
6230016	eng	We've decided to stay in Boston for another three days.
6230017	eng	I'm sure Tom will be ready by the time you get there.
6230018	eng	Tom said that he thought it would probably snow this afternoon.
6230019	eng	I thought Tom wasn't bored.
6230020	eng	We've come up with a pretty good system for doing that.
6230021	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom wasn't the one who did that.
6230022	eng	Tom said it was time to start thinking about what we should do.
6230023	eng	I thought Tom wasn't awake.
6230024	eng	We tried to figure out how to do that, but we couldn't.
6230025	eng	I'm not going to be the one who tells Tom what to do.
6230026	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be permitted to do that today.
6230027	eng	I thought Tom wasn't alone.
6230028	eng	This is the first time I've ever had to wait this long.
6230029	eng	I'm not going to be the one who tells Tom to do that.
6230030	eng	Tom said he thought he might be required to do that by himself.
6230031	eng	I thought Tom was too slow.
6230032	eng	There was something written on both sides of the paper.
6230033	eng	I'll try to find out why Tom doesn't want to do that.
6230034	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6230035	eng	I thought Tom was mistaken.
6230036	eng	The number of tourists we get every year has increased.
6230037	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom that I was going to do that.
6230038	eng	Tom put the magazine he had just finished reading on the table.
6230039	eng	I thought Tom was innocent.
6230040	eng	The movie was better than I thought it was going to be.
6230041	eng	I want to know how much time Tom has spent in prison.
6230042	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know who's going to be at the meeting.
6230043	eng	I thought Tom was handsome.
6230044	eng	Perhaps it would've been better if we hadn't done that.
6230045	eng	I want to know how much time Tom has spent in Boston.
6230046	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's not supposed to do that anymore.
6230047	eng	I thought Tom was confused.
6230048	eng	Maybe I'll come to Boston again next year at this time.
6230049	eng	I tried to talk to Tom, but he wouldn't listen to me.
6230050	eng	Tom offered me a beer, but I told him that I didn't drink beer.
6230051	eng	I thought Tom was careless.
6230052	eng	It's important that you learn how to do that correctly.
6230053	eng	I took the pen Tom handed me and signed the document.
6230054	eng	Tom looked around the room to make sure that everything was OK.
6230055	eng	I thought Tom looked happy.
6230056	eng	It would probably be ridiculous to do that by yourself.
6230057	eng	I told Tom that I thought he should lose some weight.
6230058	eng	Tom knew where his keys should've been, but they weren't there.
6230059	eng	I thought Tom looked bored.
6230060	eng	It would probably be impossible to do that by yourself.
6230061	eng	I told Tom that I thought I might be able to do that.
6230062	eng	Tom is feeling a little bit better today than he was yesterday.
6230063	eng	I think Tom won't be ready.
6230064	eng	It would probably be depressing to do that by yourself.
6230065	eng	I thought you said you'd never permit Tom to do that.
6230066	eng	Tom hasn't been back to Boston since he graduated from college.
6230067	eng	I think Tom won't be early.
6230068	eng	It won't be easy to figure out what caused the problem.
6230069	eng	I thought you said you wanted Tom to stop doing that.
6230070	eng	Tom has only been pretending that he doesn't understand French.
6230071	eng	I think Tom won't be alone.
6230072	eng	If you buy that now, you won't have to buy it tomorrow.
6230073	eng	I thought you said you wanted Tom to do that for you.
6230074	eng	Tom doesn't know whether he can do that, but he says he'll try.
6230075	eng	I think Tom will eat later.
6230076	eng	If I'm feeling better tomorrow, let's do that together.
6230077	eng	I thought we'd be able to do what Tom asked us to do.
6230078	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he wasn't supposed to do that.
6230079	eng	I think Tom will be scared.
6230080	eng	I've loved you since the first time I laid eyes on you.
6230081	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that by himself.
6230082	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him he needed to do that.
6230083	eng	I think Tom will be lonely.
6230084	eng	I'm the only student in our class who can speak French.
6230085	eng	I thought Tom would be gone by the time we got there.
6230086	eng	Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted us to do that.
6230087	eng	I think Tom will be afraid.
6230088	eng	I'm the only person in the office who can speak French.
6230089	eng	I thought Tom would be able to get that done by 2:30.
6230090	eng	Tom didn't know that I was the one who was supposed to do that.
6230091	eng	I think Tom will be absent.
6230092	eng	I'm rich, but not rich enough to buy a house like that.
6230093	eng	I thought Tom wasn't interested in mountain climbing.
6230094	eng	Tom didn't know how to do that, so he asked me to show him how.
6230095	eng	I think Tom was astonished.
6230096	eng	I wish my neighbors would get rid of their wind chimes.
6230097	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be discouraged by these results.
6230098	eng	Tom didn't know how to answer any of the questions on the test.
6230099	eng	I think Tom might be lying.
6230100	eng	I thought you said you're tried doing that three times.
6230101	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be bored by something like that.
6230102	eng	Tom called his wife to tell her he wouldn't be home for dinner.
6230103	eng	I think Tom is intoxicated.
6230104	eng	I think you don't need a driver's license to buy a car.
6230105	eng	I think Tom would like to be the next one to do that.
6230106	eng	Tom bought this truck the same day he got his driver's license.
6230107	eng	I think Tom is interesting.
6230108	eng	I think it would've been better if we hadn't done that.
6230109	eng	I think Tom would like to be the last one to do that.
6230110	eng	Tom and I'll be studying together in the library all afternoon.
6230111	eng	I think Tom is hyperactive.
6230112	eng	I spoke French today for the first time in a long time.
6230113	eng	I think Tom would like to be ready when that happens.
6230114	eng	Tom won't be able to tell you anything you don't already know.
6230115	eng	I think Tom is heartbroken.
6230116	eng	I realize I don't have enough money to buy what I want.
6230117	eng	I think Tom would get here early if you asked him to.
6230118	eng	Tom will probably be able to do that if you give him a chance.
6230119	eng	I think Tom is from Boston.
6230120	eng	I realize I don't have enough money to buy what I need.
6230121	eng	I think Tom would be doing that, too, if he knew how.
6230122	eng	Tom used to go to Boston five or six times a year on business.
6230123	eng	I think Tom is embarrassed.
6230124	eng	I pretended that I didn't know about what had happened.
6230125	eng	I think Tom will be glad that that's going to happen.
6230126	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him I didn't want to do that.
6230127	eng	I think Tom is discouraged.
6230128	eng	I looked at the menu and decided to order ham and eggs.
6230129	eng	I think Tom wanted to do that even more than you did.
6230130	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him I didn't need to do that.
6230131	eng	I think Tom has to do that.
6230132	eng	I knew I didn't have enough money to buy what I wanted.
6230133	eng	I think Tom probably isn't as old as you think he is.
6230134	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him I didn't have to do that.
6230135	eng	I think Tom had to do that.
6230136	eng	I knew I didn't have enough money to buy what I needed.
6230137	eng	I think Tom might get injured if he tries to do that.
6230138	eng	Tom says he's been waiting for that to happen for a long time.
6230139	eng	I think Tom didn't do that.
6230140	eng	I hope you can understand why I'm reluctant to do that.
6230141	eng	I think Tom is the only one who knows how to do that.
6230142	eng	Tom said there were still a lot things that needed to be done.
6230143	eng	I think I need to help Tom.
6230144	eng	I hope you can understand why I'm not going to do that.
6230145	eng	I think Tom is probably younger than you think he is.
6230146	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who felt like doing that.
6230147	eng	I still haven't kissed Tom.
6230148	eng	I heard that you're now working as a stand-up comedian.
6230149	eng	I think Tom could get injured if he tries to do that.
6230150	eng	Tom said he'd be going back to Boston right after the concert.
6230151	eng	I still haven't called Tom.
6230152	eng	I don't want my parents to know I got drunk last night.
6230153	eng	I think Tom could get injured if he tried to do that.
6230154	eng	Tom said he wouldn't want to try doing that without some help.
6230155	eng	I should've waited for Tom.
6230156	eng	I don't think that doing that would be such a bad idea.
6230157	eng	I think I heard Tom say that he was going to do that.
6230158	eng	Tom said he wished you wouldn't go out after dark by yourself.
6230159	eng	I should tell Tom I'm busy.
6230160	eng	I don't think I'd be able to do that without your help.
6230161	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I don't want to do that.
6230162	eng	Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
6230163	eng	I promised Tom I'd do that.
6230164	eng	I don't really feel like eating Ethiopian food tonight.
6230165	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I don't need to do that.
6230166	eng	Tom said he thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
6230167	eng	I pretended to believe Tom.
6230168	eng	I don't need to worry about that kind of thing anymore.
6230169	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I don't have to do that.
6230170	eng	Tom said he thought he might be allowed to do that by himself.
6230171	eng	I persuaded Tom to do that.
6230172	eng	I don't need to be told more than once to do something.
6230173	eng	I sometimes go to Boston to visit Tom and his family.
6230174	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be allowed to do that at school.
6230175	eng	I permitted Tom to do that.
6230176	eng	I don't like being the first one to show up at a party.
6230177	eng	I should probably tell Tom I don't intend to do that.
6230178	eng	Tom said he hopes to keep working here for several more years.
6230179	eng	I never saw Tom doing that.
6230180	eng	I don't intend to stay in Boston for more than three days.
6230181	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I don't like him.
6230182	eng	Tom realized he wouldn't likely be able to do that by himself.
6230183	eng	I need to help Tom do that.
6230184	vie	Cậu nên gọi cho họ
6230185	vie	Tom đang có một cơ hội lớn
6230186	vie	Con sông này chảy từ đâu?
6230187	eng	I don't have to worry about that kind of thing anymore.
6230188	eng	I saw Tom doing that in the park yesterday afternoon.
6230189	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much time he'll need to do that.
6230190	eng	I love Tom and he loves me.
6230191	eng	I don't come here every day, but I do come quite often.
6230192	eng	I might be allowed to do that if Tom does it with me.
6230193	eng	Tom is likely to be very unfriendly after what you did to him.
6230194	eng	I looked at Tom's sketches.
6230195	eng	I don't allow my children to watch TV on school nights.
6230196	eng	I lied to Tom when I said I didn't understand French.
6230197	eng	Tom invited me to stay a couple of weeks with him next summer.
6230198	eng	I lived in Boston with Tom.
6230199	eng	I didn't want to do that, but I didn't have any choice.
6230200	eng	I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
6230201	eng	Tom didn't tell me he planned to wait until Monday to do that.
6230202	eng	I know why Tom got nervous.
6230203	eng	I didn't recognize the person across the table from me.
6230204	eng	I helped Tom move his desk to other side of the room.
6230205	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him I wanted to do that.
6230206	eng	I know why Tom got annoyed.
6230207	eng	I didn't really feel like going to school this morning.
6230208	eng	I helped Tom get up from the bench he was sitting on.
6230209	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him I needed to do that.
6230210	eng	I know who stole Tom's car.
6230211	eng	I didn't realize I shouldn't be doing what I was doing.
6230212	eng	I forgot to remind Tom about his dentist appointment.
6230213	eng	Tom didn't know that we were supposed to do that by ourselves.
6230214	eng	I know that Tom is unlucky.
6230215	eng	I didn't read the contract as carefully as I should've.
6230216	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will want to do that.
6230217	eng	Tom didn't know he was supposed to do that before he got here.
6230218	eng	I know that Tom is thirsty.
6230219	eng	I didn't marry the woman my parents wanted me to marry.
6230220	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will stop doing that.
6230221	eng	Tom could be overwhelmed by all this, but I don't think he is.
6230222	eng	I know that Tom is strange.
6230223	eng	I didn't know you were supposed to do that by yourself.
6230224	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will quit doing that.
6230225	eng	Tom and his three sons go camping every weekend in the summer.
6230226	eng	I know that Tom is starved.
6230227	eng	I didn't know what time the meeting was going to start.
6230228	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will need to do that.
6230229	eng	Tom and I were very hungry by the time we got to the campsite.
6230230	eng	I know that Tom is sincere.
6230231	eng	I didn't know we were supposed to do that by ourselves.
6230232	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will have to do that.
6230233	eng	Tom and I were engaged for three months before we got married.
6230234	eng	I know that Tom is serious.
6230235	eng	I didn't know that what I'd done was against the rules.
6230236	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be absent today.
6230237	eng	Tom and I met while we were both walking our dogs in the park.
6230238	eng	I know that Tom is retired.
6230239	eng	I didn't know that I was supposed to do that by myself.
6230240	eng	I doubt if Tom will still be awake when we get there.
6230241	eng	Tom wouldn't ask you to do that if he didn't think you could.
6230242	eng	I know that Tom is puzzled.
6230243	eng	I didn't know how long it was going to take to do that.
6230244	eng	I doubt if Tom will be very hungry when he gets home.
6230245	eng	Tom would've been forgiven for doing that if he'd apologized.
6230246	eng	I know that Tom is pleased.
6230247	eng	I didn't have enough time to do what needed to be done.
6230248	eng	I don't want to say anything that might make Tom cry.
6230249	eng	Tom would stay in Boston longer if his parents would let him.
6230250	eng	I know that Tom is patient.
6230251	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what I wanted to buy.
6230252	eng	I don't want to know why Tom doesn't want to do that.
6230253	eng	Tom works from very early in the morning until late at night.
6230254	eng	I know that Tom is outside.
6230255	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what I needed to buy.
6230256	eng	I don't understand why Tom isn't supposed to do that.
6230257	eng	Tom won't know whether he can do that or not unless he tries.
6230258	eng	I know that Tom is nervous.
6230259	eng	I didn't feel like telling everybody why I was leaving.
6230260	eng	I don't think we can trust Tom as much as we used to.
6230261	eng	Tom will probably tell his friends that he's going to Boston.
6230262	eng	I know that Tom is married.
6230263	eng	I didn't decide to become a teacher until I was thirty.
6230264	eng	I don't think Tom would be surprised if you did that.
6230265	eng	Tom wanted to be here, but he had to be somewhere else today.
6230266	eng	I know that Tom is jittery.
6230267	eng	I did that yesterday for the first time in a long time.
6230268	eng	I don't think Tom would be foolish enough to do that.
6230269	eng	Tom told me that he'll be finished doing that by dinner time.
6230270	eng	I know that Tom is jealous.
6230271	eng	How much more time do you think you'll need to do that?
6230272	eng	I don't think Tom would be absent if he weren't sick.
6230273	eng	Tom told me that he never thought he'd be able to walk again.
6230274	eng	I know that Tom is healthy.
6230275	eng	How much more time do you think you'll have to do that?
6230276	eng	I don't think Tom will be present at today's meeting.
6230277	eng	Tom soon found out why none of his friends wanted to do that.
6230278	eng	I know that Tom is furious.
6230279	eng	How many more months will it take to finish doing that?
6230280	eng	I don't think Tom will be as careful as he should be.
6230281	eng	Tom shouldn't have been mountain climbing on a day like that.
6230282	eng	I know that Tom is finicky.
6230283	eng	How many months do you think it'll take you to do that?
6230284	eng	I don't think Tom will be able to do that by himself.
6230285	eng	Tom says he doesn't think it would be a good idea to do that.
6230286	eng	I know that Tom is excited.
6230287	eng	How many minutes do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6230288	eng	I don't think Tom really wants to do that by himself.
6230289	eng	Tom says Australia is his favorite place to visit in October.
6230290	eng	I know that Tom is engaged.
6230291	eng	Even someone as strong as you won't be able to do that.
6230292	eng	I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
6230293	eng	Tom said we needed at least $300 to buy everything we needed.
6230294	eng	I know that Tom is curious.
6230295	eng	Even if I wanted to do that, I don't have enough money.
6230296	eng	I don't think Tom is sure that's what he needs to do.
6230297	eng	Tom said it's what he wasn't doing that made the coach angry.
6230298	eng	I know that Tom is correct.
6230299	eng	Do you really think it would be interesting to do that?
6230300	eng	I don't think Tom can afford to buy the car he wants.
6230301	eng	Tom said it probably wouldn't take very much time to do that.
6230302	eng	I know that Tom is careful.
6230303	eng	Do you often think about what you want to do in the future?
6230304	eng	I don't think I could afford to buy a car like Tom's.
6230305	eng	Tom said he's been trying to fix the air conditioner all day.
6230306	eng	I know that Tom is at home.
6230307	eng	Did you know there are three other Toms at this school?
6230308	eng	I don't really feel like playing backgammon with Tom.
6230309	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be willing to do that without some help.
6230310	eng	I know that Tom is annoyed.
6230311	eng	Did you know it was possible to borrow that much money?
6230312	eng	I don't know whether Tom is telling the truth or not.
6230313	eng	Tom said he was hoping to get home before it started raining.
6230314	eng	I know that Tom is adopted.
6230315	eng	As I told you before, I don't want to do that with you.
6230316	eng	I don't know where Tom wants me to put his suitcases.
6230317	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be allowed to do that today.
6230318	eng	I knew where Tom was going.
6230319	eng	About how many minutes does it usually take to do that?
6230320	eng	I don't know where Tom wants me to plant the lettuce.
6230321	eng	Tom said he might come to Boston next week or the week after.
6230322	eng	I just told Tom what I did.
6230323	eng	Your lights weren't on, so I thought you weren't home.
6230324	eng	I don't know where Tom is going to be this afternoon.
6230325	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be required to do that anymore.
6230326	eng	I invited Tom to our party.
6230327	eng	You're the only one working here who can speak French.
6230328	eng	I didn't want to sing any of the songs Tom requested.
6230329	eng	Tom said he knew he might be permitted to do that by himself.
6230330	eng	I hoped Tom would be there.
6230331	eng	You'd stop doing that if I asked you to, wouldn't you?
6230332	eng	I didn't want to make the same mistakes that Tom did.
6230333	eng	Tom said he doesn't understand why you don't want to do that.
6230334	eng	I hope you'll speak to Tom.
6230335	eng	You'd like to know why I didn't do that, wouldn't you?
6230336	eng	I didn't understand exactly what Tom wanted me to do.
6230337	eng	Tom said I should've stayed in Boston for another week or so.
6230338	eng	I hope Tom isn't terrified.
6230339	eng	You weren't the only one who had to do that, were you?
6230340	eng	I didn't think that Tom would be in Boston this week.
6230341	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know he'll never be able to do that.
6230342	eng	I hope Tom isn't desperate.
6230343	eng	You weren't the only one allowed to do that, were you?
6230344	eng	I didn't think it was a good idea to let Tom do that.
6230345	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether he needs to do that or not.
6230346	eng	I hope Tom isn't depressed.
6230347	eng	You weren't the first one to try to do that, were you?
6230348	eng	I didn't think Tom would be the first one to do that.
6230349	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that now isn't the time to do that.
6230350	eng	I hope Tom does that today.
6230351	eng	You weren't surprised that I had to do that, were you?
6230352	eng	I didn't think Tom would be here, but I'm glad he is.
6230353	eng	Tom practiced the piano every day when he was in high school.
6230354	eng	I hope Tom comes to Boston.
6230355	eng	You were told not to do that by yourself, weren't you?
6230356	eng	I didn't think Tom wanted to be on the baseball team.
6230357	eng	Tom is doing that because it's what he thinks he needs to do.
6230358	eng	I helped Tom with his work.
6230359	eng	You were supposed to do that by yourself, weren't you?
6230360	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I was planning to go to Boston.
6230361	eng	Tom has just finished doing what he should've done last week.
6230362	eng	I helped Tom up the stairs.
6230363	eng	You were hoping we could do that for you, weren't you?
6230364	eng	I didn't tell Tom that the meeting had been canceled.
6230365	eng	Tom escaped from prison through a tunnel that he dug himself.
6230366	eng	I helped Tom set the table.
6230367	eng	You want to be finished doing that by 2:30, don't you?
6230368	eng	I didn't realize that Tom didn't know how to do that.
6230369	eng	Tom didn't tell me he didn't know what he was supposed to do.
6230370	eng	I helped Tom into the taxi.
6230371	eng	You probably thought I didn't have a driver's license.
6230372	eng	I didn't know you had spent so much time helping Tom.
6230373	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he was supposed to do that.
6230374	eng	I helped Tom into the boat.
6230375	eng	You need to be more careful the next time you do that.
6230376	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to go hiking with.
6230377	eng	Tom didn't seem to be doing what he was supposed to be doing.
6230378	eng	I heard that Tom does that.
6230379	eng	You look thinner than you did the last time I saw you.
6230380	eng	I didn't know who Tom was going to go to Boston with.
6230381	eng	Tom didn't seem to be able to do that, so I did that for him.
6230382	eng	I haven't seen Tom do that.
6230383	eng	You knew there was no way I could do that, didn't you?
6230384	eng	I didn't know who Tom wanted to go to the dance with.
6230385	eng	Tom didn't know how to do that, but he tried to do it anyway.
6230386	eng	I expected Tom to be there.
6230387	eng	You knew it wasn't a good idea to do that, didn't you?
6230388	eng	I didn't know whether Tom intended to do that or not.
6230389	eng	Tom didn't know how to do that until he was thirty years old.
6230390	eng	I doubt if Tom will be shy.
6230391	eng	You knew I didn't have to do that anymore, didn't you?
6230392	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom refused to help me.
6230393	eng	Tom could be cooperative. I guess we'll find out soon enough.
6230394	eng	I don't want to let Tom go.
6230395	eng	You hope to be finished doing that by 2:30, don't you?
6230396	eng	I didn't know what Tom's reasons for doing that were.
6230397	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't show up until the meeting was over.
6230398	eng	I don't want Tom to suffer.
6230399	eng	You have to be more careful the next time you do that.
6230400	eng	I didn't know that you were going to Boston with Tom.
6230401	eng	Tom and his girlfriend spent all afternoon at the art museum.
6230402	eng	I don't think that's Tom's.
6230403	eng	You didn't want anyone to see you doing that, did you?
6230404	eng	I didn't know that Tom was planning to do that today.
6230405	eng	Tom and I have been really good friends for a very long time.
6230406	eng	I don't think Tom is wrong.
6230407	eng	You didn't think we would be able to do that, did you?
6230408	eng	I didn't know if Tom would be able to do that or not.
6230409	eng	Tom's wife died in 2013. Tom himself died three years later.
6230410	eng	I don't think Tom is upset.
6230411	eng	You didn't think I would be doing that today, did you?
6230412	eng	I didn't know Tom wasn't going to be able to do that.
6230413	eng	Tom's comments were unrelated to what we were talking about.
6230414	eng	I don't think Tom is tired.
6230415	eng	You didn't seem to understand why I shouldn't do that.
6230416	eng	I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
6230417	eng	Tom won't likely be present at tomorrow afternoon's meeting.
6230418	eng	I don't think Tom is right.
6230419	eng	You didn't seem to understand why I needed to do that.
6230420	eng	I didn't know Tom and you were married to each other.
6230421	eng	Tom won't be able to do that alone. You'll need to help him.
6230422	eng	I don't think Tom is pushy.
6230423	eng	You didn't know you were supposed to do that, did you?
6230424	eng	I did everything I could to keep Tom from doing that.
6230425	eng	Tom won't be able to do that alone. You'll have to help him.
6230426	eng	I don't think Tom is happy.
6230427	eng	You didn't know it was impossible to do that, did you?
6230428	eng	How much time do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6230429	eng	Tom will probably be cold if he doesn't wear a heavier coat.
6230430	eng	I don't think Tom is funny.
6230431	eng	You didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that, did you?
6230432	eng	How many years do you think Tom has spent doing that?
6230433	eng	Tom was in the garden pulling weeds all yesterday afternoon.
6230434	eng	I don't think Tom is drunk.
6230435	eng	You could come to Boston and spend the summer with me.
6230436	eng	How many weeks do you think Tom has spent doing that?
6230437	eng	Tom wanted to say something, but he didn't know what to say.
6230438	eng	I don't think Tom is broke.
6230439	eng	You and I both know what'll happen if I don't do that.
6230440	eng	How many hours do you think Tom has spent doing that?
6230441	eng	Tom told me that he'd be finished doing that by dinner time.
6230442	eng	I don't think Tom is brave.
6230443	eng	You and I are the only ones who know about this place.
6230444	eng	How many days do you think it'll take Tom to do that?
6230445	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
6230446	eng	I don't think Tom is bored.
6230447	eng	Why weren't you here yesterday like you said you'd be?
6230448	eng	Do you think Tom can do that without getting injured?
6230449	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
6230450	eng	I don't think Tom is blind.
6230451	eng	We both need to stay in Boston for another three days.
6230452	eng	Do you have any idea how many weeks Tom will do that?
6230453	eng	Tom told me he didn't want to wait until October to do that.
6230454	eng	I don't think Tom is awake.
6230455	eng	There are several good reasons why you should do that.
6230456	eng	Do you have any idea how many hours Tom will do that?
6230457	eng	Tom thought he would be able to do that if he had some help.
6230458	eng	I don't think Tom is angry.
6230459	eng	The police spokesman said no suspects were in custody.
6230460	eng	Didn't you know there was another Tom at this school?
6230461	eng	Tom thought he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6230462	eng	I don't think Tom is alone.
6230463	eng	The lady who dropped her wineglass seemed embarrassed.
6230464	eng	Didn't you know that Tom passed away three years ago?
6230465	eng	Tom started working here as a janitor and now he's the boss.
6230466	eng	I don't think I scared Tom.
6230467	eng	Let me take a picture of you in front of the fountain.
6230468	eng	Didn't you know Tom is also a pretty good bassoonist?
6230469	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he could do that without our help.
6230470	eng	I don't like Tom's friends.
6230471	eng	It'll take you at least three days to finish this job.
6230472	eng	Didn't you know Tom and I were married to each other?
6230473	eng	Tom says he doesn't know whether he'll have time to do that.
6230474	eng	I don't like Tom's cooking.
6230475	eng	It would probably be dangerous to do that by yourself.
6230476	eng	Did you know that it took Tom three hours to do that?
6230477	eng	Tom says he and his friends like to go to the park together.
6230478	eng	I don't know Tom's brother.
6230479	eng	It would be ridiculous to try doing that by ourselves.
6230480	eng	Did you know that Tom almost never does that anymore?
6230481	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who enjoyed doing that.
6230482	eng	I don't know Tom's address.
6230483	eng	It won't be easy to determine what caused the problem.
6230484	eng	Did you know Tom has several very valuable paintings?
6230485	eng	Tom said that he didn't think doing that would be dangerous.
6230486	eng	I don't care what Tom eats.
6230487	eng	It started to rain as soon as we got the tent pitched.
6230488	vie	Tớ đã bảo cậu để đó cho tớ.
6230489	eng	All three of us thought Tom was the one who did that.
6230490	eng	Tom said it's important that we do what we can to help John.
6230491	eng	I don't believe Tom at all.
6230492	eng	It probably would be dangerous to do that by yourself.
6230493	eng	All three of Tom's brothers are on the baseball team.
6230494	eng	Tom said his life has changed a lot in the last three years.
6230495	eng	I didn't think Tom was shy.
6230496	eng	If you're finished reading the paper, could I have it?
6230497	eng	You'll ask Tom for permission to do that, won't you?
6230498	eng	Tom said he'd be able to help us do that tomorrow afternoon.
6230499	eng	I didn't see Tom yesterday.
6230500	eng	If you do that every day, you'll get good at doing it.
6230501	eng	You were impressed by how Tom did that, weren't you?
6230502	eng	Tom said he'd appreciate it if you wouldn't do that anymore.
6230503	eng	I didn't notice Tom go out.
6230504	eng	If we had children, we would've bought a bigger house.
6230505	eng	You tried to talk Tom out of doing that, didn't you?
6230506	eng	Tom said he wished you wouldn't do that by yourself anymore.
6230507	eng	I didn't like what Tom did.
6230508	eng	If it had rained yesterday, I wouldn't have done that.
6230509	eng	You think Tom will be tempted to do that, don't you?
6230510	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't parked his car under that tree.
6230511	eng	I didn't lay a hand on Tom.
6230512	eng	I'd be very disappointed if I didn't get into college.
6230513	eng	You still haven't told Tom how to do that, have you?
6230514	eng	Tom said he was stranded on a desert island for three years.
6230515	eng	I didn't go to Tom's party.
6230516	eng	I wonder if I can learn how to do that in three hours.
6230517	eng	You still don't know why Tom has to do that, do you?
6230518	eng	Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired.
6230519	eng	I didn't care what Tom did.
6230520	eng	I won't do that right away, but I'll do it eventually.
6230521	eng	You should tell Tom that he doesn't need to do that.
6230522	eng	Tom said he thought you said you didn't know how to do that.
6230523	eng	I couldn't get Tom to do that.
6230524	eng	I want to know why you haven't written the report yet.
6230525	eng	You should tell Tom that he doesn't have to do that.
6230526	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy doing that by himself.
6230527	eng	I convinced Tom to do that.
6230528	eng	I want to know whether or not you'll be ready by 2:30.
6230529	eng	You should probably tell Tom why you had to do that.
6230531	eng	I can go to Boston for Tom.
6230532	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to do that by yourself.
6230533	eng	You should probably tell Tom that you can't do that.
6230534	eng	Tom said he thought he might not need to do that by himself.
6230535	eng	I bought this car from Tom.
6230536	eng	I thought you were supposed to be in Boston this week.
6230537	eng	You should probably tell Tom that he has to do that.
6230538	eng	Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
6230539	eng	I asked Tom not to do that.
6230540	eng	I thought you said you wanted to learn how to do that.
6230541	eng	You should probably not tell Tom to do that for you.
6230542	eng	Tom said he knew he might be required to do that by himself.
6230543	eng	I asked Tom how to do that.
6230544	eng	I thought you said you wanted to do that this morning.
6230545	eng	You know why Tom doesn't want to do that, don't you?
6230546	eng	Tom said he didn't want to try doing that without some help.
6230547	eng	I arrived earlier than Tom.
6230548	eng	I think I'm the only person here who can speak French.
6230549	eng	You knew that Tom was trying to do that, didn't you?
6230550	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that because it was dangerous.
6230551	eng	How will Tom get to Boston?
6230552	eng	I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
6230553	eng	You knew Tom wasn't supposed to do that, didn't you?
6230554	eng	Tom said he didn't think it would be a good idea to do that.
6230555	eng	How long was Tom in prison?
6230556	eng	I saw a couple sitting on a park bench, holding hands.
6230557	eng	You don't really think Tom wants to do that, do you?
6230558	eng	Tom replied that he thought it would be possible to do that.
6230559	eng	How is Tom going to Boston?
6230560	eng	I remember many of the stories my grandmother told me.
6230561	eng	You don't really think Tom needs to do that, do you?
6230562	eng	Tom refused to tell me how much his new motorcycle cost him.
6230563	eng	Has Tom done that recently?
6230564	eng	I made more money on that deal than I thought I would.
6230565	eng	You don't really enjoy hanging out with Tom, do you?
6230567	eng	Everyone did that, but Tom.
6230568	eng	I hope you can understand why I'm hesitant to do that.
6230569	eng	You don't know when Tom is going to do that, do you?
6230570	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to know what needs to be done.
6230571	eng	Doesn't Tom live in Boston?
6230572	eng	I hope you can understand why I don't want to do that.
6230573	eng	You don't care whether Tom does that or not, do you?
6230574	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be enjoying himself.
6230575	eng	Does Tom speak French well?
6230576	eng	I don't want to be the one responsible for doing that.
6230577	eng	You didn't think Tom would want to do that, did you?
6230578	eng	Tom is still doing the same thing he was doing this morning.
6230579	eng	Do you think Tom is afraid?
6230580	eng	I don't really feel like going to school this morning.
6230581	eng	You didn't think Tom would need to do that, did you?
6230582	eng	Tom is fortunate that his house wasn't damaged by the storm.
6230583	eng	Do you know why Tom is mad?
6230584	eng	I don't know whether I'll have time to do that or not.
6230585	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that Tom was doing that.
6230586	eng	Tom found it hard to pretend to be interested in doing that.
6230587	eng	Did you know Tom was tired?
6230588	vie	Bọn họ khóa môi say đắm
6230589	vie	Tiếng Pháp rất khó phải không?
6230590	fra	Le vent a soulevé sa jupe.
6230591	eng	I don't know how to do that as well as most people do.
6230592	eng	You didn't know Tom didn't want to do that, did you?
6230593	eng	Tom expects all three of us to do the same thing he's doing.
6230594	eng	Did you find Tom's address?
6230595	eng	I don't intend to come back to Boston until next October.
6230596	eng	You didn't know Tom didn't need to do that, did you?
6230597	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that would be such a good idea.
6230598	eng	Could you buy that for Tom?
6230599	fra	Le vent a soulevé sa jupe et son jupon.
6230600	eng	I didn't wake up as early as I should've this morning.
6230601	eng	You didn't know Tom didn't have to do that, did you?
6230602	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that would be a very good idea.
6230603	eng	Ask Tom when he'll do that.
6230604	eng	I didn't think there was any reason we had to do that.
6230605	eng	You didn't expect Tom to refuse to do that, did you?
6230606	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he's supposed to do that.
6230607	eng	"Where's Tom?" "In Boston."
6230608	eng	I didn't think I would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6230609	eng	You didn't apologize to Tom for doing that, did you?
6230610	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very interested in what was happening.
6230611	eng	Your answer surprised Tom.
6230612	eng	I didn't take the warning seriously until it was late.
6230613	eng	You and I both know what'll happen if Tom does that.
6230614	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he was supposed to do that.
6230615	eng	You'd better not hurt Tom.
6230616	eng	I didn't realize I wasn't going to be able to do that.
6230617	eng	You and I are the only people Tom wants to help him.
6230618	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him what had happened.
6230619	eng	I'm fairly certain Tom can't do that.
6230620	eng	I didn't learn how to swim until I was in my thirties.
6230621	eng	You and I are the only people Tom says he can trust.
6230622	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him he had to do that.
6230623	eng	You look nothing like Tom.
6230624	eng	I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
6230625	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you want to do that?
6230626	eng	Tom didn't live long enough to see his daughter get married.
6230627	eng	You don't help Tom enough.
6230628	eng	I didn't know what to do with all the money I'd found.
6230629	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you need to do that?
6230630	eng	Tom didn't know you weren't supposed to do that by yourself.
6230631	eng	You could do that for Tom.
6230632	eng	I didn't know that I was supposed to help you do that.
6230633	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you have to do that?
6230634	eng	Tom didn't know we weren't supposed to do that this morning.
6230635	eng	Will Tom do that tomorrow?
6230636	eng	I didn't know that I was adopted until I was thirteen.
6230637	eng	When I first met Tom, I didn't know how rich he was.
6230638	eng	Tom didn't know we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
6230639	eng	Why's Tom studying French?
6230640	eng	I didn't know anything at all about what had happened.
6230641	eng	We have to make sure that Tom doesn't do that again.
6230642	eng	Tom didn't know that you were the one who wanted to do that.
6230643	eng	Why's Tom speaking French?
6230644	eng	I didn't have time to read the newspaper this morning.
6230645	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever been on a plane.
6230646	eng	Tom didn't know how to play the guitar until just last year.
6230647	eng	Why's Tom going to Boston?
6230648	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy everything I wanted.
6230649	eng	The only one here who's reluctant to do that is Tom.
6230650	eng	Tom asked me several questions that I didn't want to answer.
6230651	eng	Why does Tom do that here?
6230652	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy everything I needed.
6230653	eng	The neighbor's dog kept Tom awake most of the night.
6230654	eng	Tom's mother told him he could do anything he wanted to do.
6230655	eng	Why did Tom hide his face?
6230656	eng	I didn't get up this morning as early as I usually do.
6230657	eng	Please make sure Tom knows what he's supposed to do.
6230658	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that unless it was really necessary.
6230659	eng	Who told you Tom did that?
6230660	eng	I didn't come all the way from Boston just to do this.
6230661	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that.
6230662	eng	Tom would've come to Boston with me if he hadn't been busy.
6230663	eng	Who does Tom do that with?
6230664	eng	I could come to Boston next week if you need me there.
6230665	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that anymore.
6230666	eng	Tom won't likely be as exhausted today as he was yesterday.
6230667	vie	Mình nhìn thấy bọn họ trước đây
6230668	eng	Where was Tom last summer?
6230669	eng	I can't do that now because I'm not feeling very well.
6230670	eng	It would be faster to do that the way Tom suggested.
6230671	eng	Tom will be heartbroken when he finds out his dog has died.
6230672	eng	When did Tom get arrested?
6230673	eng	I can explain this in more detail if you'd like me to.
6230674	eng	It would be easier to do that the way Tom suggested.
6230675	eng	Tom wasn't able to get everything done that had to be done.
6230676	eng	What you did made Tom cry.
6230677	eng	I bought this pair of shoes for three hundred dollars.
6230678	eng	It was very generous of Tom to donate so much money.
6230679	eng	Tom told the police that he had been attacked by three men.
6230680	eng	What did Tom do yesterday?
6230681	eng	How much more time do you think it'll take to do that?
6230682	eng	Is Tom the only one who doesn't know how to do that?
6230683	eng	Tom told me that I needed to be present at today's meeting.
6230684	eng	Those don't belong to Tom.
6230685	eng	How much longer do you think I need to stay in Boston?
6230686	eng	I've given up trying to persuade Tom not to do that.
6230687	eng	Tom told me he didn't want to wait until Monday to do that.
6230688	eng	These don't belong to Tom.
6230689	eng	How many weeks do you think it'll take you to do that?
6230690	eng	I've given up trying to convince Tom not to do that.
6230691	eng	Tom thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
6230692	eng	These aren't Tom's gloves.
6230693	eng	How many times a month do you visit your grandparents?
6230694	eng	I've finally managed to persuade Tom not to do that.
6230695	eng	Tom suggested that we stay at his house instead of a hotel.
6230696	eng	Tell Tom to lock the door.
6230697	eng	How many more years will it take to finish doing that?
6230698	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be impressed by this painting.
6230699	eng	Tom spent a lot of time at the beach over the summer break.
6230700	eng	Tell Tom to do that later.
6230701	eng	How many more weeks will it take to finish doing that?
6230702	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be very hungry when he gets home.
6230703	eng	Tom should've been alone, but he was with three other guys.
6230704	eng	Tell Tom to buy some eggs.
6230705	eng	How many more hours will it take to finish doing that?
6230706	eng	I'm sure Tom will be irritated by the traffic noise.
6230707	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him why we should do that.
6230708	eng	Tell Tom to bring a salad.
6230709	eng	How many months do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6230710	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom is the only one who can do that.
6230711	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him why we had to do that.
6230712	eng	Please tell Tom the truth.
6230713	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take you to do that?
6230714	eng	I'd never seen Tom do anything that impolite before.
6230715	eng	Tom says he thinks it might not be so expensive to do that.
6230716	eng	Please ask Tom to do that.
6230717	eng	How many grams of meat do you usually cook per person?
6230718	eng	I wonder what I should do if Tom doesn't do that.
6230719	eng	Tom says he overheard both sides of the phone conversation.
6230720	eng	Perhaps Tom won't do that.
6230721	eng	Even if I wanted to do that, I don't have enough time.
6230722	eng	I wish you hadn't told Tom I had trouble doing that.
6230723	eng	Tom says he doesn't remember his parents ever spanking him.
6230724	eng	Perhaps Tom is having fun.
6230725	eng	Do you think you can do that in less than three hours?
6230726	eng	I wish I could play the ukulele as well as Tom does.
6230727	eng	Tom says he can do that with one hand tied behind his back.
6230728	eng	My parents don't like Tom.
6230729	eng	Do you really think it would be ridiculous to do that?
6230730	eng	I wanted to do that today, but Tom begged me not to.
6230731	eng	Tom said that he's been wanting to do that for a long time.
6230732	eng	My house is next to Tom's.
6230733	eng	Do you really think it would be impossible to do that?
6230734	eng	I want to know how much time it took Tom to do that.
6230735	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who wanted to do that.
6230736	eng	Let's tell Tom to do that.
6230737	eng	Do you really think it would be depressing to do that?
6230738	eng	I told Tom to stop doing that, but he did it anyway.
6230739	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who needed to do that.
6230740	eng	Let Tom eat what he wants.
6230741	eng	Didn't you know that very few people actually do that?
6230742	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have permission to do that.
6230743	eng	Tom said that he doesn't think you can do that by yourself.
6230744	eng	Let Tom buy what he wants.
6230745	eng	Didn't you know it was possible to get there by train?
6230746	eng	I thought you said you'd never allow Tom to do that.
6230747	eng	Tom said that he didn't think doing that would be possible.
6230748	eng	It's snowing where Tom is.
6230749	eng	Didn't I tell you that you didn't need to worry about me?
6230750	eng	I thought you said you were glad Tom didn't do that.
6230751	eng	Tom said his family was more important to him than his job.
6230752	eng	It's raining where Tom is.
6230753	eng	As I told you before, you need to do that by yourself.
6230754	eng	I thought Tom didn't know how to play the saxophone.
6230755	eng	Tom said he'd be going back to Boston right after the game.
6230756	eng	It looks like Tom is cold.
6230757	eng	As I told you before, you have to do that by yourself.
6230758	eng	I thought I'd be able to do what Tom asked me to do.
6230759	eng	Tom said he thought he would be able to do that by himself.
6230760	eng	It looks like Tom is busy.
6230761	eng	Are you still thinking of going to Boston next summer?
6230762	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be nervous at a time like this.
6230763	eng	Tom said he thought he was the only one who had to do that.
6230764	eng	Is Tom obliged to do that?
6230765	eng	Always doing the same thing every day must get boring.
6230766	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to do that.
6230767	eng	Tom said he thought he might be permitted to do that again.
6230768	eng	I've never seen Tom's dog.
6230769	eng	All the children seem to be having trouble doing that.
6230770	eng	I think Tom might get killed if he tries to do that.
6230771	eng	Tom said he knew he might be allowed to do that by himself.
6230772	eng	I'm sure Tom will be slow.
6230773	eng	"Will you play tennis tomorrow?" "No, we'll play golf."
6230774	eng	I think Tom is going to have a hard time doing that.
6230775	eng	Tom said he doesn't enjoy doing that as much as he used to.
6230776	eng	I'm sure Tom will be home.
6230777	eng	"Do I have to do that again?" "No, you don't need to."
6230778	eng	I think Tom is getting a little tired of doing that.
6230779	eng	Tom said he didn't have enough money to buy what he wanted.
6230780	eng	I'm sure Tom will be fair.
6230781	eng	"Are you going to go see that movie?" "Yes, I plan to."
6230782	eng	I think Tom did that, even though he said he didn't.
6230783	eng	Tom said he didn't have enough money to buy what he needed.
6230784	eng	I'm positive Tom did that.
6230785	eng	You're the only person in the office who can do that.
6230786	eng	I think Tom could've solved that problem by himself.
6230787	eng	Tom said he can speak French, but he can't really speak it.
6230788	eng	I'm not going Tom's party.
6230789	eng	You're the only person I know who can't speak French.
6230790	eng	I think Tom could be ready by the time you get here.
6230791	eng	Tom said doing that was easier than he thought it would be.
6230792	eng	I'm glad Tom spoke French.
6230793	eng	You're the only one who wants to go home early today.
6230794	eng	I should've been able to do that without Tom's help.
6230795	eng	Tom probably thought he was going to need to do that today.
6230796	eng	I'll go to Boston for Tom.
6230797	eng	You're the only one who seems to know how to do that.
6230798	eng	I should probably tell Tom that he needs to do that.
6230799	eng	Tom probably thought he was going to have to do that today.
6230800	eng	I'd never let Tom do that.
6230801	eng	You're the first person to ever ask me that question.
6230802	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I won't do that.
6230803	eng	Tom probably knows more about the accident than he told us.
6230804	eng	I wouldn't do that to Tom.
6230805	eng	You're likely the only person who is able to do that.
6230806	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I can't do that.
6230807	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether he has to do that or not.
6230808	eng	I wonder if Tom is stoned.
6230809	eng	You're getting better because you practice every day.
6230810	eng	I should probably not tell Tom I'm going to do that.
6230811	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether I need to do that or not.
6230812	eng	I wonder if Tom is sleepy.
6230813	eng	You'll be able to do that if you put your mind to it.
6230814	eng	I never thought Tom would come back to Boston again.
6230815	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether I have to do that or not.
6230816	eng	I wonder if Tom is scared.
6230817	eng	You won't be able to do that without some assistance.
6230818	eng	I know this isn't the first time Tom has lied to us.
6230819	eng	Tom never gave up and eventually was able to get that done.
6230820	eng	I wonder if Tom is lonely.
6230821	eng	You were able to do that without any problems, right?
6230822	eng	I knew Tom was going to be arrested sooner or later.
6230823	eng	Tom is the only person I know who can play the French horn.
6230824	eng	I wonder if Tom is hungry.
6230825	eng	You tried to do that yesterday afternoon, didn't you?
6230826	eng	I got Tom to go to the supermarket to buy some eggs.
6230827	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who didn't need to do that.
6230828	eng	I wonder if Tom is honest.
6230829	eng	You think I'm getting tired of doing that, don't you?
6230830	eng	I doubt very seriously that that will embarrass Tom.
6230831	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who didn't have to do that.
6230832	eng	I wonder if Tom is guilty.
6230833	eng	You should sell your shares now before it's too late.
6230834	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be sympathetic.
6230835	eng	Tom is doing that because it's what he thinks he should do.
6230836	eng	I wonder if Tom is biased.
6230837	eng	You should make sure that Mary doesn't do that today.
6230838	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be disobedient.
6230839	eng	Tom is doing that because it's what he thinks he has to do.
6230840	eng	I wonder if Tom is asleep.
6230841	eng	You never thought I'd want to do that again, did you?
6230842	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be discouraged.
6230843	eng	Tom has been in the living room reading a book all morning.
6230844	eng	I wonder if Tom is afraid.
6230845	eng	You look more like your grandfather than your father.
6230846	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be cooperative.
6230847	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that would be such a bad idea.
6230848	eng	I wasn't at Tom's funeral.
6230849	eng	You look like you were half expecting this to happen.
6230850	eng	I don't want to sing any of the songs Tom requested.
6230851	eng	Tom doesn't like being the first one to show up at a party.
6230852	eng	I wasn't able to save Tom.
6230853	eng	You know why I wasn't supposed to do that, don't you?
6230854	eng	I don't want to say anything that'll make Tom angry.
6230855	eng	Tom doesn't know he's supposed to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6230856	eng	I wasn't able to meet Tom.
6230857	eng	You know they won't permit you to do that, don't you?
6230858	eng	I don't want to make the same mistakes that Tom did.
6230859	eng	Tom didn't take the medicine that the doctor had given him.
6230860	eng	I wasn't able to help Tom.
6230861	eng	You know I'm supposed to do that tomorrow, don't you?
6230862	eng	I don't think you could persuade Tom not to do that.
6230863	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he didn't need to do that.
6230864	eng	I wasn't able to find Tom.
6230865	eng	You knew I was supposed to do that today, didn't you?
6230866	eng	I don't think Tom would've permitted you to do that.
6230867	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he didn't have to do that.
6230868	eng	I wanted a picture of Tom.
6230869	eng	You don't think I'm interested in doing that, do you?
6230870	eng	I don't think Tom would still be willing to do that.
6230871	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him I had to do that.
6230872	eng	I want to see you and Tom.
6230873	eng	You don't think I'm going to do that anymore, do you?
6230874	eng	I don't think Tom would be stupid enough to do that.
6230875	eng	Tom didn't know that he was supposed to do that by himself.
6230876	eng	I want to see Tom do that.
6230877	eng	You don't really want to go swimming with us, do you?
6230878	eng	I don't think Tom will be amused by what's going on.
6230879	eng	Tom asked me to teach him how to say "thank you" in French.
6230880	eng	I visited Boston with Tom.
6230881	eng	You don't have to eat anything you don't want to eat.
6230882	eng	I don't think Tom will be able to do that very well.
6230883	eng	Tom and I've decided to go to Boston together next weekend.
6230884	eng	I told Tom the same thing.
6230885	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that I needed to do that.
6230886	eng	I don't think Tom really plans to do that this week.
6230887	eng	Tom and I worked together on that project for three months.
6230888	eng	I thought Tom wasn't here.
6230889	eng	You didn't seem convinced that you needed to do that.
6230890	eng	I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much.
6230891	eng	Tom and I talked about what we'd do if that happened to us.
6230892	eng	I thought Tom wasn't cold.
6230893	eng	You didn't really come here just to do that, did you?
6230894	eng	I don't think Tom can afford to buy a car like that.
6230895	eng	Tom and I sat next to each other in French class last year.
6230896	eng	I thought Tom was worried.
6230897	eng	You didn't know that I was going to do that, did you?
6230898	eng	I don't think I understand what Tom is trying to do.
6230899	eng	Tom and I aren't the only ones here who can't speak French.
6230900	eng	I thought Tom was outside.
6230901	eng	You didn't know that I had to do that today, did you?
6230902	eng	I don't see anything wrong with letting Tom do that.
6230903	eng	Tom advised me not to tell anyone that I'd won the lottery.
6230904	eng	I thought Tom was nervous.
6230905	eng	You believe doing that would be a mistake, don't you?
6230906	eng	I don't like Tom and I don't like his sister either.
6230907	eng	Tom admitted he was the one who ate the last piece of cake.
6230908	eng	I thought Tom was jealous.
6230909	eng	Would you like to try some raspberry jam that I made?
6230910	eng	I don't know why Tom was in a bad mood this morning.
6230911	eng	Tom would be healthier if he didn't eat so much junk food.
6230912	eng	I thought Tom was at home.
6230913	eng	Who told you I wouldn't be able to do that by myself?
6230914	eng	I don't know why Tom needs to borrow thirty dollars.
6230915	eng	Tom worked as a teacher in Boston until his death in 2013.
6230916	eng	I think that car is Tom's.
6230917	eng	Who needs to be at the meeting in Boston next Monday?
6230918	eng	I don't know whether Tom is good at swimming or not.
6230919	eng	Tom won't likely be interested in going to the art museum.
6230920	eng	I think that Tom did that.
6230921	eng	We'll keep doing that unless someone tells us not to.
6230922	eng	I don't know whether Tom is going to do that or not.
6230923	eng	Tom won't be able to do everything you've asked him to do.
6230924	eng	I think Tom would be fair.
6230925	eng	We should probably change the locks on all the doors.
6230926	eng	I don't know whether Tom intended to do that or not.
6230927	eng	Tom was the first one to give me advice on how to do that.
6230928	eng	I think Tom won't be late.
6230929	eng	We can stay in Boston a few more days if you want to.
6230930	eng	I don't know how much time Tom will need to do that.
6230931	eng	Tom was carrying two suitcases and had a pack on his back.
6230932	eng	I think Tom won't be last.
6230933	eng	The movie was much better than I thought it would be.
6230934	eng	I don't know how much time Tom will have to do that.
6230935	eng	Tom usually goes to school by bus, but sometimes he walks.
6230936	eng	I think Tom won't be cold.
6230937	eng	The cat jumped off the couch and hid under the table.
6230938	eng	I don't always arrive on time, but Tom usually does.
6230939	eng	Tom used to carry his ukulele with him everywhere he went.
6230940	eng	I think Tom will be upset.
6230941	eng	Taste it and see if you think I should add more salt.
6230942	eng	I didn't want to interrupt Tom while he was talking.
6230943	eng	Tom told me he'd wait for us in front of the Hilton Hotel.
6230944	eng	I think Tom will be first.
6230945	eng	One of my sons is a doctor and the other is a lawyer.
6230946	eng	I didn't think that Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6230947	eng	Tom thought he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6230948	eng	I think Tom will be early.
6230949	eng	Neither of us wants to do that, but one of us has to.
6230950	eng	I didn't think Tom would want to do that by himself.
6230951	eng	Tom still has the car his father gave him three years ago.
6230952	eng	I think Tom will be bored.
6230953	eng	My parents would never let me go to Boston by myself.
6230954	eng	I didn't think Tom would get bored, but I was wrong.
6230955	eng	Tom sleeps with his window open, no matter how cold it is.
6230956	eng	I think Tom will be alone.
6230957	eng	My parents are the ones who taught me how to do that.
6230958	eng	I didn't think Tom would be the last one to do that.
6230959	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him he needed to do that.
6230960	eng	I think Tom is unemployed.
6230961	eng	My father told me that I shouldn't read books in bed.
6230962	eng	I didn't think Tom would be glad that that happened.
6230963	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can find the time to do that.
6230964	eng	I think Tom is suspicious.
6230965	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be possible to do that by yourself.
6230966	eng	I didn't think Tom would be doing that this morning.
6230967	eng	Tom says he doesn't know if he has enough time to do that.
6230968	eng	I think Tom is overworked.
6230969	eng	Maybe I should stay in Boston for another week or so.
6230970	eng	I didn't think Tom would be cooperative, but he was.
6230971	eng	Tom said three of those boys are the ones who beat him up.
6230972	eng	I think Tom is interested.
6230973	eng	It's been a long time since we've done that together.
6230974	eng	I didn't think Tom really had to do that by himself.
6230975	eng	Tom said there were muddy footprints on the kitchen floor.
6230976	eng	I think Tom is frustrated.
6230977	eng	It's absolutely necessary for me to do that tomorrow.
6230978	eng	I didn't tell Tom what time he should come tomorrow.
6230979	eng	Tom said the committee was going to vote on that tomorrow.
6230980	eng	I think Tom is frightened.
6230981	eng	It would probably be possible to do that by yourself.
6230982	eng	I didn't tell Tom that the picnic had been canceled.
6230983	eng	Tom said that probably wouldn't happen in the near future.
6230984	eng	I think Tom is downstairs.
6230985	eng	It would be almost impossible to do that by yourself.
6230986	eng	I didn't tell Tom that he needed to be more careful.
6230987	eng	Tom said that probably wouldn't happen again anytime soon.
6230988	eng	I think Tom is doing that.
6230989	eng	It took me a little longer than usual to fall asleep.
6230990	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I didn't know how to do that.
6230991	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who liked doing that.
6230992	eng	I think Tom is displeased.
6230993	vie	Thật tuyệt vời
6230994	eng	It should be possible for you to do that by yourself.
6230995	eng	I didn't tell Tom his parents were getting divorced.
6230996	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who hated doing that.
6230997	eng	I think Tom is disgusting.
6230998	eng	It probably wouldn't be smart to do that by yourself.
6230999	eng	I didn't really think Tom did that without any help.
6231000	eng	Tom said that he thought doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
6231001	eng	I think Tom is delusional.
6231002	eng	It doesn't look like you're interested in doing that.
6231003	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wasn't having a good time.
6231004	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to do his homework.
6231005	eng	I think Tom is colorblind.
6231006	eng	If you don't want that book anymore, could I have it?
6231007	eng	I didn't notice that Tom was wearing a wedding ring.
6231008	eng	Tom said he thought that pair of shoes were too expensive.
6231009	eng	I think Tom has done that.
6231010	eng	If it had rained, I probably wouldn't have done that.
6231011	eng	I didn't know why Tom wouldn't accept my invitation.
6231012	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to get that done by 2:30.
6231013	eng	I think Tom can't do that.
6231014	eng	I've just made a pot of coffee. Would you like a cup?
6231015	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to see in Boston.
6231016	eng	Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
6231017	eng	I spoke to Tom about that.
6231018	eng	I've heard that this is the oldest city in the world.
6231019	eng	I didn't know whether what Tom said was true or not.
6231020	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't have enough time to do that.
6231021	eng	I should've talked to Tom.
6231022	eng	I've gained a lot of weight in the last three months.
6231023	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was good at skiing or not.
6231024	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he can find the time to do that.
6231025	eng	I should've smiled at Tom.
6231027	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was good at French or not.
6231028	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do anything until it got light.
6231029	eng	I should've protected Tom.
6231030	eng	I wouldn't work in Boston even if you paid me double.
6231031	eng	I didn't know whether Tom could speak French or not.
6231032	eng	Tom said he didn't think he'd have enough time to do that.
6231033	eng	I should help Tom do that.
6231034	eng	I wish I had more time to do things with my children.
6231035	eng	I didn't know when Tom was planning to go to Boston.
6231036	eng	Tom said I should've stayed in Boston for a few more days.
6231037	eng	I should apologize to Tom.
6231038	eng	I went swimming with some of my friends last weekend.
6231039	eng	I didn't know that Tom was planning to quit his job.
6231040	eng	Tom remarried his first wife after he divorced his third.
6231041	eng	I saw that movie with Tom.
6231042	eng	I was annoyed by the constant dripping of the faucet.
6231043	eng	I didn't know Tom was still living with his parents.
6231044	eng	Tom probably won't have to stay in the hospital overnight.
6231045	eng	I might not see Tom today.
6231046	eng	I warned you what would happen if you didn't do that.
6231047	eng	I didn't get a chance to thank Tom for all his help.
6231048	eng	Tom probably doesn't really know how to play the trombone.
6231049	eng	I made Tom do that for me.
6231050	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to be doing that here.
6231051	eng	I already told Tom that I don't know how to do that.
6231052	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why he's getting another chance.
6231053	eng	I looked at Tom's picture.
6231054	eng	I thought you said you've only tried doing that once.
6231055	eng	How much time do you think Tom will need to do that?
6231056	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who can sing well and who can't.
6231057	eng	I looked at Tom's drawing.
6231058	eng	I thought you said you were the first one to do that.
6231059	eng	How much time do you think Tom will have to do that?
6231060	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's not supposed to park there.
6231061	eng	I know where Tom did that.
6231062	eng	I thought you said you were interested in doing that.
6231063	eng	How many sandwiches did Tom take to school with him?
6231064	eng	Tom probably didn't even have known about today's meeting.
6231065	eng	I know what Tom has to do.
6231066	eng	I thought you said you wanted me to buy that for you.
6231067	eng	How many days do you think Tom has spent doing that?
6231068	eng	Tom pretended not to notice what was written on the board.
6231069	eng	I know that Tom is strong.
6231070	eng	I thought that maybe we could do that together later.
6231071	eng	How did you know Tom only ate fruits and vegetables?
6231072	eng	Tom plays the banjo with one of the local bluegrass bands.
6231073	eng	I know that Tom is strict.
6231074	eng	I think it's finally time for us to start doing that.
6231075	eng	Even though I told Tom he shouldn't do that, he did.
6231076	eng	Tom often tries to do that, but still hasn't been able to.
6231077	eng	I know that Tom is stoned.
6231078	eng	I hope to stay in Boston for a few weeks next spring.
6231079	eng	Even though I told Tom he should do that, he didn't.
6231080	eng	Tom may want to stay in Boston until the end of the month.
6231081	eng	I know that Tom is stingy.
6231082	eng	I don't want to get married until I'm in my thirties.
6231083	eng	Even though I told Tom he had to do that, he didn't.
6231084	eng	Tom isn't willing to do that unless you do the same thing.
6231085	eng	I know that Tom is sleepy.
6231086	eng	I don't think I could've done that without your help.
6231087	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would cost us more.
6231088	eng	Tom isn't likely to be very hungry when he gets home.
6231089	eng	I know that Tom is single.
6231090	eng	I don't think I can afford to buy a new computer now.
6231091	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be efficient.
6231092	eng	Tom isn't likely to be gone by the time we get there.
6231093	eng	I know that Tom is scared.
6231094	eng	I don't really enjoy playing games on my phone.
6231095	eng	Does Tom want to stay in Boston with us next summer?
6231096	eng	Tom isn't doing that because he doesn't think he ought to.
6231097	eng	I know that Tom is lonely.
6231098	eng	You don't need to apologize. You've done nothing wrong.
6231099	eng	Do you think Tom would still be hesitant to do that?
6231100	eng	Tom isn't doing that because he doesn't think he needs to.
6231101	eng	I know that Tom is insane.
6231102	eng	I don't like being the one who always has to do that.
6231103	eng	Do you think Tom could do that without getting hurt?
6231104	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be having any fun.
6231105	eng	I know that Tom is hungry.
6231106	eng	I don't have enough time to do what needs to be done.
6231107	eng	Do you think Tom can do that without getting killed?
6231108	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were asked to do that.
6231109	eng	I know that Tom is guilty.
6231110	eng	I don't have enough money to buy the computer I want.
6231111	eng	Do you really think Tom would permit you to do that?
6231112	eng	Tom is likely to be the one responsible for what happened.
6231113	eng	I know that Tom is grumpy.
6231114	eng	I don't care who does that as long as it gets done.
6231115	eng	Do you have any idea how many days Tom will do that?
6231116	eng	Tom is able to do that with one hand tied behind his back.
6231117	eng	I know that Tom is greedy.
6231118	eng	I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in prison.
6231119	eng	Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
6231120	eng	Tom has said he intends to pay back all the money he owes.
6231121	eng	I know that Tom is famous.
6231122	eng	I didn't want to do that, but I felt I had no choice.
6231123	eng	Didn't you know that Tom wasn't paid for doing that?
6231124	eng	Tom has probably known how to do that since he was a baby.
6231125	eng	I know that Tom is biased.
6231126	eng	I didn't think you'd be drinking so early in the day.
6231127	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to be here today?
6231128	eng	Tom has been good, so he could stay longer if he wants to.
6231129	eng	I know that Tom is asleep.
6231130	eng	I didn't think you would be the first one to do that.
6231131	eng	Didn't you know that Tom had a house on Park Street?
6231132	eng	Tom got a book down from the shelf and started reading it.
6231133	eng	I know that Tom is afraid.
6231134	eng	I didn't think I'd ever get used to living in Boston.
6231135	eng	Didn't you know Tom was very good at playing soccer?
6231136	eng	Tom doesn't want to discourage you from trying to do that.
6231137	eng	I know that Tom is absent.
6231138	eng	I didn't take the medicine my doctor told me to take.
6231139	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still a high school student?
6231140	eng	Tom doesn't want to be the one responsible for doing that.
6231141	eng	I know that Tom does that.
6231142	eng	I didn't read everything as carefully as I should've.
6231143	eng	Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston for a long time?
6231144	eng	Tom doesn't really enjoy doing that as much as he used to.
6231145	eng	I know Tom's phone number.
6231146	eng	I didn't know you used to be a professional musician.
6231147	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't know how to speak French?
6231148	eng	Tom doesn't know how to do that as well as most people do.
6231149	eng	I know Tom went to Boston.
6231150	eng	I didn't know what time the party was going to start.
6231151	eng	Did you know that Tom was in a coma for three years?
6231152	eng	Tom didn't want to do that, but he didn't have any choice.
6231153	eng	I know Tom visited Boston.
6231154	eng	I didn't know what the wood was going to be used for.
6231155	eng	Did you know that Tom saw you in the park yesterday?
6231156	eng	Tom didn't tell me that he was the one who had to do that.
6231157	eng	I know Tom is over thirty.
6231158	eng	I didn't know that you wanted to do that by yourself.
6231159	eng	Did you know that Tom is an extremely gifted artist?
6231160	eng	Tom didn't know what was in the box that was on the table.
6231161	eng	I know Tom has to do that.
6231162	eng	I didn't know that what I'd done was against the law.
6231163	eng	Did you know Tom was going to go to Boston tomorrow?
6231164	eng	Tom didn't know that what he'd done was against the rules.
6231165	eng	I know I can count on Tom.
6231166	eng	I didn't know how to play tennis when I was thirteen.
6231167	eng	Did you know Tom used to be a professional musician?
6231168	eng	Tom didn't know that he was supposed to do that yesterday.
6231169	eng	I knew what Tom had to do.
6231170	eng	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that by myself.
6231171	eng	Did you know Tom is very good at playing basketball?
6231172	eng	Tom didn't figure out how to do that until just yesterday.
6231173	eng	I invited Tom to my party.
6231174	eng	I didn't have enough space to do what I wanted to do.
6231175	eng	Ask Tom if he has enough money to buy what he needs.
6231176	eng	Tom could've been punished for what he did, but he wasn't.
6231177	eng	I hoped Tom would do that.
6231178	eng	I didn't find out I was adopted until I was thirteen.
6231179	eng	All three of Tom's brothers are planning to do that.
6231180	eng	Tom and I studied French at the same university in Boston.
6231181	eng	I hoped Tom could do that.
6231182	eng	I didn't eat the salad because there was bacon in it.
6231183	eng	About how many times do you think Tom has done that?
6231184	eng	Tom and I stayed at the same hotel when we were in Boston.
6231185	eng	I hope that Tom does that.
6231186	eng	I didn't do that as much last week as I usually does.
6231187	eng	You'll try to find out why Tom did that, won't you?
6231188	eng	Tom admitted he was the one who left the windows unlocked.
6231189	eng	I hope Tom isn't punished.
6231190	eng	I didn't come to school yesterday because I got sick.
6231191	eng	You'll never be able to talk Tom out of doing that.
6231192	eng	Tom wouldn't have been able to do that without your help.
6231193	eng	I hope Tom isn't offended.
6231194	eng	I didn't care how it got done as long as it got done.
6231195	eng	You weren't able to convince Tom do that, were you?
6231196	eng	Tom would've done that himself if he'd had more the time.
6231197	eng	I hope Tom isn't mistaken.
6231198	eng	How much time do you think it'll take you to do that?
6231199	eng	You were worried Tom wouldn't do that, weren't you?
6231200	eng	Tom won't likely get cold since he's dressed very warmly.
6231201	eng	I hope Tom isn't confused.
6231202	eng	How much time do you estimate you'll need to do that?
6231203	eng	You told Tom I could do that by myself, didn't you?
6231204	eng	Tom won't likely be interested in going to an art museum.
6231205	eng	I hope Tom isn't careless.
6231206	eng	How much more time do you think is needed to do that?
6231207	eng	You still hope Tom will do that for you, don't you?
6231208	eng	Tom wasn't the first one to volunteer to help us do that.
6231209	eng	I hope Tom isn't arrested.
6231210	eng	How many years do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6231211	eng	You should've waited until Tom got here to do that.
6231212	eng	Tom wasn't able to find the documents he was looking for.
6231213	eng	I hope Tom is sympathetic.
6231214	eng	How many weeks do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6231215	eng	You should probably tell Tom you intend to do that.
6231216	eng	Tom was the only other person who didn't want to do that.
6231217	eng	I hope Tom is still alive.
6231218	eng	How many textbooks did you have to buy this semester?
6231219	eng	You should probably tell Tom why he should do that.
6231220	eng	Tom was the first person who has ever offered to help me.
6231221	eng	I hope Tom is cooperative.
6231222	eng	How many more days will it take to finish doing that?
6231223	eng	You should help Tom carry the boxes out to his car.
6231224	eng	Tom was the first one who said he didn't want to do that.
6231225	eng	I hope Tom goes to Boston.
6231226	eng	How many hours do you think you watched TV last week?
6231227	eng	You know Tom wasn't supposed to do that, don't you?
6231228	eng	Tom was sleeping on the sofa when I walked into the room.
6231229	eng	I hope Tom gets back soon.
6231230	eng	How many hours do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6231231	eng	You knew Tom didn't plan on doing that, didn't you?
6231232	eng	Tom was in his room listening to music all day yesterday.
6231233	eng	I helped Tom out of a jam.
6231234	eng	How many days do you think it'll take you to do that?
6231235	eng	You knew Tom didn't do that on purpose, didn't you?
6231236	eng	Tom told me that I need to be present at today's meeting.
6231237	eng	I helped Tom open the box.
6231238	eng	Don't forget that you need to pay your rent tomorrow.
6231239	eng	You knew Tom didn't do that by himself, didn't you?
6231240	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't do that unless I did it with him.
6231241	eng	I helped Tom dye his hair.
6231242	eng	Do you think you can do that without getting injured?
6231243	eng	You hope that Tom won't do that anymore, don't you?
6231244	eng	Tom started going bald when he was in his early thirties.
6231245	eng	I helped Tom buy this car.
6231246	eng	Do you really think it would be unethical to do that?
6231247	eng	You hope Tom doesn't tell us to do that, don't you?
6231248	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him I wanted to do that.
6231249	eng	I helped Tom a little bit.
6231250	eng	Do you really think it would be expensive to do that?
6231251	eng	You haven't yet convinced Tom to do that, have you?
6231252	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him I needed to do that.
6231253	eng	I heard that Tom did that.
6231254	eng	Do you really think it would be enjoyable to do that?
6231255	eng	You haven't done that as much as Tom has, have you?
6231256	eng	Tom says he's going to do all his homework before dinner.
6231257	eng	I had to help Tom do that.
6231258	eng	Do you really think it would be dangerous to do that?
6231259	eng	You had a hunch that Tom would do that, didn't you?
6231260	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he could do that kind of thing.
6231261	eng	I got very angry with Tom.
6231262	eng	Do you really believe that black cats cause bad luck?
6231263	eng	You don't seem convinced that Tom needs to do that.
6231264	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how to do that very well.
6231265	eng	I expected Tom to help me.
6231266	eng	Didn't you know you weren't supposed to do that here?
6231267	eng	You don't know why Tom asked me to do that, do you?
6231268	eng	Tom said the solution to the problem wasn't very obvious.
6231269	eng	I expected Tom to do that.
6231270	eng	Didn't you know you weren't going to pass this class?
6231271	eng	You didn't think Tom would really do that, did you?
6231272	eng	Tom said the scenery was more beautiful than he expected.
6231273	eng	I expected Tom to be here.
6231274	eng	Didn't you know there's more than one way to do this?
6231275	eng	You didn't tell Tom I intended to do that, did you?
6231276	eng	Tom said that he thought the judge's decision was unfair.
6231277	eng	I doubt Tom would do that.
6231278	eng	Didn't you know that your taillights weren't working?
6231279	eng	You didn't know why Tom wanted to do that, did you?
6231280	eng	Tom said that he thought it would be possible to do that.
6231281	eng	I don't think Tom is ugly.
6231282	eng	About how many hours does it usually take to do that?
6231283	eng	You didn't know why Tom needed to do that, did you?
6231284	eng	Tom said that he didn't think doing that would be enough.
6231285	eng	I don't think Tom is sure.
6231286	eng	You're the only person I know who drinks white wine.
6231287	eng	You didn't know Tom would do that so well, did you?
6231288	eng	Tom said that I don't need to do that if I don't want to.
6231289	eng	I don't think Tom is slow.
6231290	eng	You're the only one who doesn't know how to do this.
6231291	eng	You didn't know Tom had already done that, did you?
6231292	eng	Tom said that I don't have to do that if I don't want to.
6231293	eng	I don't think Tom is sick.
6231294	eng	You're the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
6231295	eng	You didn't know I had to help Tom do that, did you?
6231296	eng	Tom said it isn't uncommon to see that kind of bird here.
6231297	eng	I don't think Tom is rich.
6231298	eng	You're the only Canadian I've ever gone skiing with.
6231299	eng	You didn't believe Tom would ever do that, did you?
6231300	eng	Tom said he'd appreciate it if you could do that for him.
6231301	eng	I don't think Tom is nosy.
6231302	eng	You're the one who told me that I shouldn't do that.
6231303	eng	You and I are the only people Tom wants to talk to.
6231304	eng	Tom said he thought there was a good chance that it would snow.
6231305	eng	I don't think Tom is nice.
6231306	eng	You're not going to be happy when you hear the news.
6231307	eng	Why haven't you helped Tom like you said you would?
6231308	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy camping by himself.
6231309	eng	I don't think Tom is lazy.
6231310	eng	You're not actually going to do that today, are you?
6231311	eng	Why do you think Tom might be reluctant to do that?
6231312	eng	Tom said he thought he might not need to do that anymore.
6231313	eng	I don't think Tom is here.
6231314	eng	You'd have to be deranged to do something like that.
6231315	eng	Why did you tell Tom I thought he couldn't do that?
6231316	eng	Tom said he thought he might not have to do that anymore.
6231317	eng	I don't think Tom is done.
6231318	eng	You'd be stupid if you tried to do that by yourself.
6231319	eng	Why did you tell Tom I didn't have time to do that?
6231320	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be permitted to do that.
6231321	eng	I don't think Tom is cute.
6231322	eng	You weren't very interested in doing that, were you?
6231323	eng	Who told you Tom would want to go swimming with us?
6231324	eng	Tom said he thought he might be allowed to do that again.
6231325	eng	I don't think Tom is cold.
6231326	eng	You weren't the one who actually did that, were you?
6231327	eng	When I got home, Tom was asleep on the front porch.
6231328	eng	Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
6231329	eng	I don't know how Tom died.
6231330	eng	You weren't actually the one who did that, were you?
6231331	eng	What do you want to do while we're waiting for Tom?
6231332	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't be in the office on Monday.
6231333	eng	I didn't want to kiss Tom.
6231334	eng	You were very the first one to do that, weren't you?
6231335	eng	Was it you who was supposed to tell Tom to do that?
6231336	eng	Tom said he knew he might not need to do that by himself.
6231337	eng	I didn't want Tom to sing.
6231338	eng	You were the one who wanted to do that, weren't you?
6231339	eng	Was it you who told Tom he doesn't have to do that?
6231340	eng	Tom said he knew he might not have to do that by himself.
6231341	eng	I didn't pay Tom anything.
6231342	eng	You were the first person who did that, weren't you?
6231343	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever been in Boston.
6231344	eng	Tom said he has something he wanted to do this afternoon.
6231345	eng	I didn't notice Tom leave.
6231346	eng	You were actually the one who did that, weren't you?
6231347	eng	There's no reason Tom needs to know why I did that.
6231348	eng	Tom said he has something he needed to do this afternoon.
6231349	eng	I didn't help Tom do that.
6231350	eng	You think that doing that is a good idea, don't you?
6231351	eng	The way Tom does that seems a little strange to me.
6231352	eng	Tom said he didn't know how to do that until last summer.
6231353	eng	I didn't hear Tom come in.
6231354	eng	You think doing that would be worthwhile, don't you?
6231355	eng	That wasn't the only reason why Tom had to do that.
6231356	eng	Tom promised me he'd pay back the money he owes me today.
6231357	eng	I didn't have to help Tom.
6231358	eng	You still don't know who's going to do that, do you?
6231359	eng	So far, Tom is the only one who's said he's coming.
6231360	eng	Tom probably just didn't know what he was supposed to do.
6231361	eng	I didn't ask Tom anything.
6231362	eng	You shouldn't have done that without our permission.
6231363	eng	Please tell Tom to buy a couple of loaves of bread.
6231364	eng	Tom probably just didn't know he was supposed to do that.
6231365	eng	I didn't apologize to Tom.
6231366	eng	You should've been able to do that without our help.
6231367	eng	Please make sure Tom does what he's supposed to do.
6231368	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that won't happen anytime soon.
6231369	eng	I didn't actually hit Tom.
6231370	eng	You should've been able to do that without any help.
6231371	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not likely to be fired.
6231372	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to explain how he did that.
6231373	eng	I did that instead of Tom.
6231374	eng	You often speak French with your friends, don't you?
6231375	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly what he ought to do.
6231376	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's not likely to be punished.
6231377	eng	I can swim, but Tom can't.
6231378	eng	You know why I'm not supposed to do that, don't you?
6231379	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly what he needs to do.
6231380	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he'll never be able to do that.
6231381	eng	I came to Boston with Tom.
6231382	eng	You know I was supposed to do that today, don't you?
6231383	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly what has to be done.
6231384	eng	Tom pretended not to notice what was written on the sign.
6231385	eng	How did Tom break his leg?
6231386	eng	You knew we weren't supposed to do that, didn't you?
6231387	eng	It was very considerate of you to buy that for Tom.
6231388	eng	Tom let go of the rope and the bucket fell into the well.
6231389	eng	How badly was Tom injured?
6231390	eng	You haven't had the chance to do that yet, have you?
6231391	eng	If I'd been there, I wouldn't have let Tom do that.
6231392	eng	Tom knew there were plenty of people who agreed with him.
6231393	eng	Have you ever lied to Tom?
6231394	fra	C'était une journée d'été.
6231395	eng	You haven't done that in a very long time, have you?
6231396	vie	Bọn họ sợ tới nỗi không làm gì được.
6231397	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be amused by what's going on.
6231398	eng	Tom knew he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6231399	eng	Even Tom can speak French.
6231400	eng	You have our full support no matter what you decide.
6231401	eng	I'm sure Tom will be very hungry when he gets home.
6231402	eng	Tom isn't able to do that alone. You'll have to help him.
6231403	eng	Did Tom like it in Boston?
6231404	eng	You don't think I want to do that right now, do you?
6231406	eng	Tom is the only one who won't be at the meeting tomorrow.
6231407	eng	Ask Tom to come to Boston.
6231408	eng	You don't know when I'm supposed to do that, do you?
6231409	eng	I'm staying at the same hotel where Tom is staying.
6231410	eng	Tom is planning to buy a small island just off the coast.
6231411	eng	Ask Tom if we can do that.
6231412	eng	You don't have to go to Boston if you don't want to.
6231414	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who weren't able to do that.
6231415	eng	Ask Tom if he wants to go.
6231416	eng	You didn't think I'd be tempted to do that, did you?
6231417	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if Tom didn't go to Boston.
6231418	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were told to do that.
6231419	eng	Ask Tom if he can do that.
6231420	eng	You didn't seem to be having any trouble doing that.
6231421	eng	I wouldn't allow Tom to go to Boston if I were you.
6231422	eng	Tom hasn't told me where he wants me to put his suitcase.
6231423	eng	Are you sure Tom is ready?
6231424	eng	You didn't seem to be aware that you had to do that.
6231425	eng	I wonder if Tom will be able to do that by himself.
6231426	eng	Tom has three sons who are professional baseball players.
6231427	eng	"Who did that?" "Tom did."
6231428	eng	You didn't look like you were in a hurry to do that.
6231429	eng	I wonder if Tom is really as rich as he says he is.
6231430	eng	Tom has finished painting the picture he's been painting.
6231431	eng	Your reply surprised Tom.
6231432	eng	You didn't know that I was able to do that, did you?
6231433	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he shouldn't do that.
6231434	eng	Tom has been working hard all day, even though he's sick.
6231435	eng	You trust Tom, don't you?
6231436	eng	You didn't know I no longer had to do that, did you?
6231437	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he needed to do that.
6231438	eng	Tom has been walking with a cane ever since his accident.
6231439	eng	You really impressed Tom.
6231440	eng	You didn't have enough strength to do that, did you?
6231441	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me what he'd done.
6231442	eng	Tom has been playing the trombone for almost three years.
6231443	eng	You don't pay Tom enough.
6231444	eng	Would you mind taking care of my dog while I'm away?
6231445	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom wasn't able to do that.
6231446	eng	Tom has been playing the drums for less than three years.
6231447	eng	Will Tom do that with us?
6231448	eng	Who was the person you were talking to a moment ago?
6231449	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't want to do that.
6231450	eng	Tom has advised me to do that before I go back to Boston.
6231451	eng	Will Tom buy that for us?
6231452	eng	What's wrong with the way we're planning to do that?
6231453	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't need to do that.
6231454	eng	Tom had trouble sleeping because of the pain in his legs.
6231455	eng	Why is Tom so mad at you?
6231456	eng	We should've expected something like this to happen.
6231457	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom didn't have to do that.
6231458	eng	Tom doesn't like being the one who always has to do that.
6231459	eng	Why did Tom get so angry?
6231460	eng	We always get a lot of mosquitoes this time of year.
6231461	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me what had happened.
6231462	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that if he doesn't really want to.
6231463	eng	Why did Tom do that here?
6231464	eng	We always get a lot of complaints this time of year.
6231465	eng	I waited for Tom all afternoon, but he didn't come.
6231466	eng	Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that by yourself.
6231467	eng	Who's in Boston with Tom?
6231468	eng	Those are the children you'll be teaching French to.
6231469	eng	I used to work at the same place that Tom does now.
6231470	eng	Tom didn't know we were supposed to do that this morning.
6231471	eng	When did Tom buy his car?
6231472	eng	There's nothing I'll be able to do about that today.
6231473	eng	I told Tom that I don't have permission to do that.
6231474	eng	Tom didn't know we were supposed to do that by ourselves.
6231475	eng	What's Tom good at doing?
6231476	eng	There are several reasons why you shouldn't do that.
6231477	eng	I told Tom that I didn't need to be there tomorrow.
6231478	eng	Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that by myself.
6231479	eng	What Tom said isn't true.
6231480	eng	The question is how to say no without sounding rude.
6231481	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have to be there tomorrow.
6231482	eng	Tom didn't know he wasn't supposed to do that by himself.
6231483	eng	We expect Tom to do that.
6231484	eng	The old man standing under the tree seemed confused.
6231485	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to teach me how to do that.
6231486	eng	Tom didn't begin playing the guitar until just last year.
6231487	eng	Those aren't Tom's shoes.
6231488	eng	The last thing I remember were the lights going out.
6231489	eng	I told Tom I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
6231490	eng	Tom and I take turns reading bedtime stories to the kids.
6231491	eng	This isn't Tom's bicycle.
6231492	eng	The house I grew up in didn't have an indoor toilet.
6231493	eng	I told Tom I didn't know what I was supposed to do.
6231494	eng	Tom and I stayed at a fancy hotel when we were in Boston.
6231495	eng	This bicycle isn't Tom's.
6231496	eng	Strawberries aren't only delicious, they're healthy.
6231497	eng	I thought you were going to ask Tom not to do that.
6231498	eng	Tom and I often go out for a couple of drinks after work.
6231499	eng	They know what Tom wants.
6231500	eng	Please make sure that you do that at 2:30 every day.
6231501	eng	I thought you said you wanted Tom to do that today.
6231502	eng	Tom and I hung out together a lot when we were teenagers.
6231503	eng	These books aren't Tom's.
6231504	eng	Please check and see if we'll be allowed to do that.
6231505	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that by himself.
6231506	eng	Tom and I have gone out for lunch together several times.
6231507	eng	Perhaps Tom will do that.
6231508	eng	Most people don't like to do that when it's raining.
6231509	eng	I thought Tom would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6231510	eng	Tom and I aren't the only ones here who can speak French.
6231511	eng	Only Tom spoke in French.
6231512	eng	It's going to be tough to do that without your help.
6231513	eng	I thought Tom would be amused by what was going on.
6231514	eng	Tom and I are the ones who are supposed to be doing that.
6231515	eng	My room is next to Tom's.
6231516	eng	It would probably be foolish to do that by yourself.
6231517	eng	I thought Tom would be able to get that done today.
6231518	eng	Tom and I are planning to get married on Valentine's Day.
6231519	eng	My desk is next to Tom's.
6231520	eng	It won't take as long to do that as you might think.
6231521	eng	I think Tom would be doing that now if he knew how.
6231522	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that if he hadn't wanted to.
6231523	eng	My closest friend is Tom.
6231524	eng	It took me more time than usual to get here today.
6231525	eng	I think Tom won't be gone by the time we get there.
6231526	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that if he hadn't needed to.
6231527	eng	My brother's name is Tom.
6231528	eng	It probably wouldn't be wise to do that by yourself.
6231529	eng	I think Tom will be drunk by the time we get there.
6231530	eng	Tom wouldn't have been able to do that without our help.
6231531	eng	Maybe Tom didn't do that.
6231532	eng	It probably wouldn't be safe to do that by yourself.
6231533	eng	I think Tom is probably older than you think he is.
6231534	eng	Tom wouldn't be allowed to do that even if he wanted to.
6231535	eng	Let's get Tom to do that.
6231536	eng	It probably wouldn't be easy to do that by yourself.
6231537	eng	I think Tom could do that if he put his mind to it.
6231538	eng	Tom would've done that himself if he'd known how to.
6231539	eng	Let's ask Tom to help us.
6231540	eng	If would've been good to do that, so why didn't you?
6231541	eng	I suggest that you go to Boston with Tom next week.
6231542	eng	Tom would be very disappointed if he saw you doing that.
6231543	eng	Let's ask Tom to do that.
6231544	eng	If we don't do that soon, we won't be able to do it.
6231545	eng	I should've done that the way Tom told me to do it.
6231546	eng	Tom won't likely be present at this afternoon's meeting.
6231547	eng	Let Tom buy that for you.
6231548	eng	If it weren't raining, I'd be able to do that today.
6231549	eng	I should tell Tom that I don't know how to do that.
6231550	eng	Tom won't likely be as grumpy today as he was yesterday.
6231551	eng	Is Tom unable to do that?
6231552	eng	I've been living in Boston for the past three years.
6231553	eng	I should probably tell Tom I won't do that anymore.
6231554	eng	Tom won't be able to do anything you've asked him to do.
6231555	eng	Is Tom still a bartender?
6231556	eng	I've been asked not to tell you anything about that.
6231557	eng	I should probably tell Tom I don't want to do that.
6231558	eng	Tom will probably be interested in seeing your pictures.
6231559	eng	Is Tom really doing that?
6231560	eng	I'm probably the only person here who has done that.
6231561	eng	I should probably tell Tom I don't need to do that.
6231562	eng	Tom will likely go to Boston during his summer vacation.
6231563	eng	Is Tom afraid to do that?
6231564	eng	I'll be very disappointed if the picnic is canceled.
6231565	eng	I should probably tell Tom I don't have to do that.
6231566	eng	Tom will likely be very grateful if you do that for him.
6231567	eng	I've seen Tom doing that.
6231569	eng	I never told Tom I wanted to go to Boston with him.
6231570	eng	Tom will be going back to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6231571	eng	I've never seen Tom swim.
6231572	eng	I wish there were something else I could do to help.
6231573	eng	I never told Tom I didn't know how to speak French.
6231574	eng	Tom wasn't able to remember where he had parked his car.
6231575	eng	I'm sure Tom will be shy.
6231576	eng	I was going to do that, but it was late so I didn't.
6231577	eng	I might've been in Boston at the same time Tom was.
6231578	eng	Tom was in the kitchen making a salad when we got there.
6231579	eng	I'm sure Tom can do that.
6231580	eng	I was able to do that better than I thought I would.
6231581	eng	I know this isn't the first time Tom has done that.
6231582	eng	Tom told me that he thought he might be able to do that.
6231583	eng	I wonder if Tom is upset.
6231584	eng	I wanted to go to college, but I couldn't afford to.
6231585	eng	I hope that Tom likes the present I bought for him.
6231586	eng	Tom told me that I'm the strongest person he's ever met.
6231587	eng	I wonder if Tom is tired.
6231588	eng	I want to know how much time you've spent in Boston.
6231589	eng	I forgot to tell Tom to take his umbrella with him.
6231590	eng	Tom told me he thought it would be dangerous to do that.
6231591	eng	I wonder if Tom is right.
6231592	eng	I want to know how much time it took you to do that.
6231593	eng	I doubt very seriously that that will frighten Tom.
6231594	eng	Tom thought he wouldn't be able to do that this morning.
6231595	eng	I wonder if Tom is drunk.
6231596	eng	I want to get a tattoo of a mermaid on my right arm.
6231597	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be suspicious.
6231598	eng	Tom thought he might be permitted to do that by himself.
6231599	eng	I wonder if Tom is crazy.
6231600	eng	I want to buy that. However, I don't have any money.
6231601	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be reasonable.
6231602	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he doesn't want to do that.
6231603	eng	I wonder if Tom is broke.
6231604	eng	I thought you were supposed to doing that right now.
6231605	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be interested.
6231606	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he doesn't need to do that.
6231607	eng	I wonder if Tom is bored.
6231608	eng	I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
6231609	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be handcuffed.
6231610	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he doesn't have to do that.
6231611	eng	I wonder if Tom is awake.
6231612	eng	I thought you said you were excused from doing that.
6231613	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be doing that.
6231614	eng	Tom spent a lot of time playing games when he was a kid.
6231615	eng	I wonder if Tom is angry.
6231616	eng	I thought you said you wanted to do that right away.
6231617	eng	I doubt that Tom really intended to do that.
6231618	eng	Tom should've been able to do that with his eyes closed.
6231619	eng	I wonder if Tom is alone.
6231620	eng	I thought you said you had forgotten how to do that.
6231621	eng	I doubt if Tom will be finished doing that by 2:30.
6231622	eng	Tom should be able to do that if he puts his mind to it.
6231623	eng	I wonder if Tom is alive.
6231624	eng	I thought I'd be able to do what you asked me to do.
6231625	eng	I doubt if Tom will be difficult to get along with.
6231626	eng	Tom seemed to be worried about what was going to happen.
6231627	eng	I won't make Tom do that.
6231628	eng	I think that I'll go to Boston the month after next.
6231629	eng	I don't think that Tom did his homework by himself.
6231630	eng	Tom seemed like he was a lot happier than he used to be.
6231631	eng	I won't help Tom anymore.
6231632	eng	I think it'll be necessary for you to do that again.
6231633	eng	I don't think Tom will be up at this time of night.
6231634	eng	Tom says he thinks it'll be impossible to do that today.
6231635	eng	I won't do that with Tom.
6231636	eng	I think it would be a good idea if someone did that.
6231637	eng	I don't think Tom will be the first one to do that.
6231638	eng	Tom says he has something he wants to do this afternoon.
6231639	eng	I wish Tom had done that.
6231640	eng	I think I'm the only person who can do that for you.
6231641	eng	I don't think Tom will be interested in doing that.
6231642	eng	Tom says he has something he needs to do this afternoon.
6231643	eng	I went to Boston for Tom.
6231644	eng	I think I should stay in Boston a little bit longer.
6231645	eng	I don't think Tom is sure that's what he has to do.
6231646	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he'll ever be able to do that.
6231647	eng	I want to make Tom smile.
6231648	eng	I really should've stayed in Boston a little longer.
6231649	eng	I don't think Tom has studied French for very long.
6231650	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he has enough time to do that.
6231651	eng	I thought Tom was sleepy.
6231652	eng	I often listen to the radio while doing my homework.
6231653	eng	I don't like the same kind of movies that Tom does.
6231654	eng	Tom says he doesn't know when he's supposed to be there.
6231655	eng	I thought Tom was scared.
6231656	eng	I may be able to stay in Boston for three more days.
6231657	eng	I don't know who Tom wants to go to the dance with.
6231658	eng	Tom says he can't remember things as well as he used to.
6231659	eng	I thought Tom was lonely.
6231660	eng	I know that I won't have enough strength to do that.
6231661	eng	I don't know who Tom is going to go to Boston with.
6231662	eng	Tom says he can't believe he finally managed to do that.
6231663	eng	I thought Tom was hungry.
6231664	eng	I know I don't have enough money to buy what I want.
6231665	eng	I don't know whether Tom intends to do that or not.
6231666	eng	Tom says he and his friends often play beach volleyball.
6231667	eng	I thought Tom was afraid.
6231668	eng	I know I don't have enough money to buy what I need.
6231669	eng	I don't know how to do what Tom has asked me to do.
6231670	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the only one who had to do that.
6231671	eng	I thought Tom was absent.
6231672	eng	I hope you can understand why I'm afraid to do that.
6231673	eng	I don't allow my children to play with Tom anymore.
6231674	eng	Tom said it was time to start thinking about doing that.
6231675	eng	I think Tom will be last.
6231676	eng	I hope you asked for permission before you did that.
6231677	eng	I didn't want to say anything that might upset Tom.
6231678	eng	Tom said it probably wouldn't take much time to do that.
6231679	eng	I think Tom will be cold.
6231680	eng	I hope to be back in Boston by the end of the month.
6231681	eng	I didn't want Tom to do that, but he did it anyway.
6231682	eng	Tom said he's really glad he was asked to give a speech.
6231683	eng	I think Tom is unmarried.
6231684	eng	I doubt I'll ever be able to do that as well as you.
6231685	eng	I didn't think it would be safe for Tom to do that.
6231686	eng	Tom said he'll be in the hospital for about three weeks.
6231687	eng	I think Tom is terrified.
6231688	eng	I don't yet have enough money to buy the car I want.
6231689	eng	I didn't think Tom would be in Boston last weekend.
6231690	eng	Tom said he'd help me figure out what needed to be done.
6231691	eng	I think Tom is skeptical.
6231692	eng	I don't want to spend the rest of my life in prison.
6231693	eng	I didn't think Tom would be doing that for so long.
6231694	eng	Tom said he'd be able to do that, but he wasn't able to.
6231695	eng	I think Tom is irritated.
6231696	eng	I don't want to spend any more time discussing this.
6231697	eng	I didn't think Tom was glad that that had happened.
6231698	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to lock the door.
6231699	eng	I think Tom is incorrect.
6231700	eng	I don't think we should delay doing that any longer.
6231701	eng	I didn't think Tom was difficult to get along with.
6231702	eng	Tom said he thought the statue weighed about 300 pounds.
6231703	eng	I think Tom is impressed.
6231704	eng	I don't think I'd be doing that if I didn't want to.
6231705	eng	I didn't tell Tom I'd never been to Boston before.
6231706	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to get that done today.
6231707	eng	I think Tom is impatient.
6231708	eng	I don't think I have enough energy to do that today.
6231709	eng	I didn't tell Tom anything about what had happened.
6231710	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that before 2:30.
6231711	eng	I think Tom is exhausted.
6231712	eng	I don't need to go back to Boston until next Monday.
6231713	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wasn't telling the truth.
6231714	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be required to do that.
6231715	eng	I think Tom is easygoing.
6231716	eng	I don't know who's living in the house next to mine.
6231717	eng	I didn't know who Tom was planning to do that with.
6231718	eng	Tom said he thought he might need to do that by himself.
6231719	eng	I think Tom is desperate.
6231720	eng	I don't have very many friends who can speak French.
6231721	eng	I didn't know whether Tom would agree to go or not.
6231722	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that by himself.
6231723	eng	I think Tom is depressed.
6231724	eng	I don't have to go back to Boston until next Monday.
6231725	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was good at chess or not.
6231726	eng	Tom said he knew he might be permitted to do that today.
6231727	eng	I think Tom is confident.
6231728	eng	I don't have any time right now, so I can't do that.
6231729	eng	I didn't know whether Tom wanted to do that or not.
6231730	eng	Tom said he hoped he got home before it started raining.
6231731	eng	I think Tom is concerned.
6231732	eng	I don't have any problem that I can't handle myself.
6231733	eng	I didn't know what time to meet Tom at the airport.
6231734	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he'll ever be able to do that.
6231735	eng	I should've let Tom sing.
6231736	eng	I don't have a dog now, but I used to have a poodle.
6231737	eng	I didn't know that you'd be here until Tom told me.
6231738	eng	Tom said he didn't want to pay that much for a used car.
6231739	eng	I should let Tom help me.
6231740	eng	I didn't want to tell anybody about what I had done.
6231741	eng	I didn't know that Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6231742	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help us clean the garage out.
6231743	eng	I should let Tom do that.
6231744	eng	I didn't think you'd be finished doing that by 2:30.
6231745	eng	I didn't know that Tom used to live on Park Street.
6231746	eng	Tom said he didn't think that's what we should be doing.
6231747	eng	I owe Tom a lot of money.
6231748	eng	I didn't think you would be the last one to do that.
6231749	eng	I didn't know that Tom had decided to quit his job.
6231750	eng	Tom said he couldn't remember where he'd parked the car.
6231751	eng	I often help Tom do that.
6231752	eng	I didn't think you were going to be able to do that.
6231753	eng	I didn't know Tom would have to do that on his own.
6231754	eng	Tom said he couldn't remember his French teacher's name.
6231755	eng	I might see Tom tomorrow.
6231756	eng	I didn't tell my friends that I was going to Boston.
6231757	eng	I didn't know Tom would have to do that by himself.
6231758	eng	Tom said I didn't sound as excited as he thought I'd be.
6231759	eng	I know why Tom is afraid.
6231760	eng	I didn't tell anyone what I was getting ready to do.
6231761	eng	I didn't know Tom wasn't supposed to do that today.
6231762	eng	Tom refused to tell me how much his new motorcycle cost.
6231763	eng	I know that Tom is young.
6231764	eng	I didn't tell anyone that I'd dropped out of school.
6231766	eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that without your help.
6231767	eng	I know that Tom is wrong.
6231768	eng	I didn't start to play the flute until I was thirty.
6231769	eng	I didn't have any money, so I couldn't go with Tom.
6231770	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know he's got to do that today.
6231771	eng	I know that Tom is weird.
6231772	eng	I didn't start playing the recorder until last year.
6231773	eng	I bet Tom would be able to show you how to do that.
6231774	eng	Tom probably doesn't want to do that again anytime soon.
6231775	eng	I know that Tom is upset.
6231776	eng	I didn't start playing the banjo until I was thirty.
6231777	eng	How many more months do you think Tom will do that?
6231778	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who he should ask to help him.
6231779	eng	I know that Tom is tired.
6231780	eng	I didn't need to come here today, but I came anyway.
6231781	eng	Even though it's a holiday, Tom went to his office.
6231782	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who can do that and who can't.
6231783	eng	I know that Tom is sorry.
6231785	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would take longer.
6231786	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what needs to be done.
6231787	eng	I know that Tom is smart.
6231789	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be more fun.
6231790	eng	Tom only needed to tell me once what he wanted me to do.
6231791	eng	I know that Tom is short.
6231792	eng	I didn't know you were so good at playing the drums.
6231793	eng	Do you think you could persuade Tom not to do that?
6231794	eng	Tom needs to make sure that he's ready to leave by 2:30.
6231795	eng	I know that Tom is right.
6231796	vie	Bạn có nghĩ là bạn làm việc với chúng tôi được không?
6231797	eng	I didn't know who my French teacher was going to be.
6231798	eng	Do you think Tom would still be willing to do that?
6231799	eng	Tom needs to be more careful the next time he does that.
6231800	eng	I know that Tom is ready.
6231801	eng	I didn't know whether I'd be able to do that or not.
6231802	eng	Do you think Tom might be interested in doing that?
6231803	eng	Tom learned how to do that when he was living in Boston.
6231804	eng	I know that Tom is picky.
6231805	eng	I didn't know what to say, so I didn't say anything.
6231806	eng	Didn't you know that Tom wasn't having a good time?
6231807	eng	Tom knows there are plenty of people who agree with him.
6231808	eng	I know that Tom is lucky.
6231809	eng	I didn't know that you were going to Boston with us.
6231810	eng	Didn't you know that Tom isn't planning to do that?
6231811	eng	Tom knew he might not be required to do that by himself.
6231812	eng	I know that Tom is heavy.
6231813	eng	I didn't know it was possible to get there by train.
6231814	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to teach French in Boston?
6231815	eng	Tom isn't doing that because he doesn't think he should.
6231816	eng	I know that Tom is funny.
6231817	eng	I didn't know I shouldn't be doing what I was doing.
6231818	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't have a driver's license?
6231819	eng	Tom isn't doing that because he doesn't think he has to.
6231820	eng	I know that Tom is drunk.
6231821	eng	I didn't have time to finish my homework last night.
6231822	eng	Did you tell Tom I didn't actually want to do that?
6231823	eng	Tom is unconvinced that doing that would be a good idea.
6231824	eng	I know that Tom is crazy.
6231825	eng	I didn't have enough time to do what had to be done.
6231826	eng	Did you know Tom was still living with his parents?
6231827	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to want to be here.
6231828	eng	I know that Tom is broke.
6231829	eng	I didn't have enough time to do what I wanted to do.
6231830	eng	Did you know Tom is actually not very conservative?
6231831	eng	Tom is the only one in our class who can play the banjo.
6231832	eng	I know that Tom is brave.
6231833	eng	I didn't have enough time to do what I needed to do.
6231834	eng	You're the only one who ever really talked to Tom.
6231835	eng	Tom is the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.
6231836	eng	I know that Tom is bossy.
6231837	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what I had to buy.
6231838	eng	You'll never forgive Tom for doing that, will you?
6231839	eng	Tom is probably the only person who can help us do that.
6231840	eng	I know that Tom is bored.
6231841	eng	I didn't have any money, so I couldn't buy any food.
6231842	eng	You'd never forgive Tom if he did that, would you?
6231843	eng	Tom is probably the only person who can help me do that.
6231844	eng	I know that Tom is blind.
6231845	eng	I didn't get up early enough to catch the first bus.
6231846	eng	You'd be willing to do that for Tom, wouldn't you?
6231847	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were asked to leave.
6231848	eng	I know that Tom is awake.
6231849	eng	I didn't get my driver's license until I was thirty.
6231850	eng	You weren't surprised that Tom did that, were you?
6231851	eng	Tom is a better pitcher this year than he was last year.
6231852	eng	I know that Tom is alone.
6231853	eng	I didn't do that because I didn't think I needed to.
6231854	eng	You were surprised when Tom did that, weren't you?
6231855	eng	Tom hasn't changed a bit since that last time I saw him.
6231856	eng	I know that Tom is alive.
6231857	eng	I didn't care who helped me, as long as someone did.
6231858	eng	You warned Tom not to do that anymore, didn't you?
6231859	eng	Tom has two daughters who are married and one who isn't.
6231860	eng	I know that Tom did that.
6231861	eng	I bought that house on Park Street I told you about.
6231862	eng	You tried to talk Tom into doing that, didn't you?
6231863	eng	Tom has been waiting for that to happen for a long time.
6231864	eng	I know Tom would do that.
6231865	eng	How much time do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6231866	eng	You tried to stop Tom from doing that, didn't you?
6231867	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what needs to be done.
6231868	eng	I know Tom won't do that.
6231869	eng	How much more time do you think you need to do that?
6231870	eng	You told Tom I had trouble doing that, didn't you?
6231871	eng	Tom has been playing the harmonica for most of his life.
6231872	eng	I know Tom was surprised.
6231873	eng	How much money do you have in your wallet right now?
6231874	eng	You told Tom I didn't like doing that, didn't you?
6231875	eng	Tom has been living by himself for the past three years.
6231876	eng	I know Tom has been hurt.
6231877	eng	How many times have you been absent from this class?
6231878	eng	You told Tom I didn't have to do that, didn't you?
6231879	eng	Tom has been living by himself for the last three years.
6231880	eng	I know Tom could do that.
6231881	eng	How many times did you go to the hospital last year?
6231882	eng	You thought Tom would want to do that, didn't you?
6231883	eng	Tom has always been one of the best players on our team.
6231884	eng	I know Tom can't do that.
6231885	eng	How many sandwiches do you think you ate last month?
6231886	eng	You thought Tom would need to do that, didn't you?
6231887	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he shouldn't do that.
6231888	eng	I knew Tom could do that.
6231889	eng	How many minutes do you think it'll take to do that?
6231890	eng	You thought Tom would like to do that, didn't you?
6231891	eng	Tom doesn't like fish very much and very seldom eats it.
6231892	eng	I hope Tom won't do that.
6231893	eng	How many days do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6231894	eng	You thought Tom would have to do that, didn't you?
6231895	eng	Tom doesn't like fish very much and seldom ever eats it.
6231896	eng	I hope Tom wins the race.
6231897	eng	How did you know that I already knew how to do that?
6231898	eng	You thought Tom had done that already, didn't you?
6231899	eng	Tom doesn't know why his boss wants him to go to Boston.
6231900	eng	I hope Tom likes it here.
6231901	eng	Even though it'll take a lot of money, I'll do that.
6231902	eng	You think Tom won't be able to do that, don't you?
6231903	eng	Tom does drink at least one cup of coffee every morning.
6231904	eng	I hope Tom isn't nervous.
6231905	eng	Don't you come to Boston three or four times a year?
6231906	eng	You should've asked Tom for permission to do that.
6231907	eng	Tom didn't tell his friends that he was going to Boston.
6231908	eng	I hope Tom isn't jealous.
6231909	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
6231910	eng	You know how much Tom hates doing that, don't you?
6231911	eng	Tom didn't start playing the violin until he was thirty.
6231912	eng	I hope Tom isn't annoyed.
6231913	eng	Do you think it would be possible for us to do that?
6231914	eng	You know Tom isn't supposed to do that, don't you?
6231915	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him what I'd done.
6231916	eng	I hope Tom is supportive.
6231917	eng	Do you still eat hamburgers as often as you used to?
6231918	eng	You knew Tom wouldn't stop doing that, didn't you?
6231919	eng	Tom didn't know that what he'd done was against the law.
6231920	eng	I hope Tom is reasonable.
6231922	eng	You knew Tom wasn't likely to do that, didn't you?
6231923	eng	Tom didn't know that I was supposed to help him do that.
6231924	eng	I hope Tom is optimistic.
6231925	eng	Do you really think it would be romantic to do that?
6231926	eng	You knew Tom said he wouldn't do that, didn't you?
6231927	eng	Tom didn't know anything at all about what had happened.
6231928	eng	I hope Tom is interested.
6231929	eng	Do you really think it would be possible to do that?
6231930	eng	You knew Tom said he going to do that, didn't you?
6231931	eng	Tom didn't get his driver's license until he was thirty.
6231932	eng	I hope Tom is handcuffed.
6231933	eng	Do you believe that we aren't alone in the universe?
6231934	eng	You knew Tom didn't intend to do that, didn't you?
6231935	eng	Tom didn't do that as much last week as he usually does.
6231936	eng	I hope Tom is doing that.
6231937	eng	Could you check to see if the garage door is closed?
6231938	eng	You hope that Tom will do that for you, don't you?
6231939	eng	Tom didn't begin to study French until late in his life.
6231940	eng	I hope Tom gets arrested.
6231941	eng	As I told you before, I'm going to do that tomorrow.
6231942	eng	You hope Tom will want to do that, too, don't you?
6231943	eng	Tom decided to go back to doing that the way he used to.
6231944	eng	I helped Tom to his feet.
6231945	eng	Are there many good restaurants near where you live?
6231946	eng	You hope Tom doesn't ask us to do that, don't you?
6231947	eng	Tom could've been the one responsible for what happened.
6231948	eng	I helped Tom tie his tie.
6231949	eng	About how many days does it usually take to do that?
6231950	eng	You didn't tell Tom why I had to do that, did you?
6231951	eng	Tom could've been in Boston by now if he'd wanted to be.
6231952	eng	I helped Tom make dinner.
6231953	eng	"Who helped you?" "No one. I did everything myself."
6231954	eng	You didn't realize Tom needed to do that, did you?
6231955	eng	Tom can't stay in Boston. He has to get back to Chicago.
6231956	eng	I helped Tom fix his car.
6231957	eng	"Have you ever done that?" "Yes, but only one time."
6231958	eng	You didn't learn how to do that from Tom, did you?
6231959	eng	Tom called his wife to tell her he'd be late for dinner.
6231960	eng	I hate shopping with Tom.
6231961	eng	You're the only person I'd consider giving this to.
6231962	eng	You didn't know that Tom used to do that, did you?
6231963	eng	Tom bought three bicycles, one for each of his children.
6231964	eng	I don't want to kiss Tom.
6231965	eng	You're the only one who'll be permitted to do that.
6231966	eng	You didn't expect Tom to want to do that, did you?
6231967	eng	Tom asked me to go to the supermarket to buy some bread.
6231968	eng	I don't want Tom to sing.
6231969	eng	You're the only one who seems to be having any fun.
6231970	eng	You asked Tom why he hadn't done that, didn't you?
6231971	eng	Tom and I were the first people to volunteer to do that.
6231972	eng	I don't think Tom is shy.
6231973	eng	You're likely the only person who wants to do that.
6231974	eng	You asked Tom if he'd like to do that, didn't you?
6231975	eng	Tom and I went fishing together a few times last spring.
6231976	eng	I don't think Tom is sad.
6231977	eng	You're likely the only person who needs to do that.
6231978	eng	You asked Tom if he wanted to do that, didn't you?
6231979	eng	Tom and I played ping pong together yesterday afternoon.
6231980	eng	I don't think Tom is old.
6231981	eng	You'll likely lose some weight if follow this diet.
6231982	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you won't do that?
6231983	eng	Tom and I played in the backyard together all afternoon.
6231984	eng	I don't think Tom is mad.
6231985	eng	You wouldn't be able to do that tonight, would you?
6231986	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you can't do that?
6231987	eng	Tom and I have always gotten along well with each other.
6231988	eng	I don't think Tom is fat.
6231989	eng	You won't be permitted to do that without a permit.
6231990	eng	Why don't you get Tom to teach you how to do that?
6231991	eng	Tom and I didn't like each other when we were teenagers.
6231992	eng	I didn't want Tom's help.
6231993	eng	You won't be able to do that without a lot of help.
6231994	eng	Why did you tell Tom I didn't remember doing that?
6231995	eng	Tom and I are both married to women younger than we are.
6231996	eng	I didn't try to kiss Tom.
6231997	eng	You won't be able to do that without a little help.
6231998	eng	Why did you tell Tom I didn't know how to do that?
6231999	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if we made him do that, would he?
6232000	eng	I didn't think about Tom.
6232001	eng	You were very the last one to do that, weren't you?
6232002	eng	When did you find out Tom wasn't going to do that?
6232003	eng	Tom wondered why none of his friends wanted to do that.
6232004	eng	I didn't like Tom's idea.
6232005	eng	You were only allowed to do that once, weren't you?
6232006	eng	Was it you who told Tom he didn't need to do that?
6232007	eng	Tom will probably get injured if he does that that way.
6232008	eng	I didn't let Tom kiss me.
6232009	eng	You were doing that just this morning, weren't you?
6232010	eng	Was it you who told Tom he didn't have to do that?
6232011	eng	Tom will probably be able to do that faster on his own.
6232012	eng	I didn't let Tom give up.
6232013	eng	You want to be the first one to do that, don't you?
6232014	eng	This is the first time I've ever seen Tom do that.
6232015	eng	Tom will probably be able to do that faster by himself.
6232016	eng	I didn't let Tom do that.
6232017	eng	You think that doing that is a bad idea, don't you?
6232018	eng	There's no way Tom would do something that stupid.
6232019	eng	Tom will likely be awake before the rest of the family.
6232020	eng	I didn't help Tom at all.
6232021	eng	You think doing that would be a mistake, don't you?
6232022	eng	The reason Tom went to Boston was to do just that.
6232023	eng	Tom will be finished doing that by the end of the week.
6232024	eng	I didn't do that for Tom.
6232025	eng	You think I do that at least once a day, don't you?
6232026	eng	The police said the search for Tom would continue.
6232027	eng	Tom was the first one in our family to visit Australia.
6232028	eng	I didn't ask Tom to help.
6232029	eng	You still haven't learned how to do that, have you?
6232030	eng	The only one here who's willing to do that is Tom.
6232031	eng	Tom told me that he's glad that that's going to happen.
6232032	eng	I could help Tom do that.
6232033	eng	You still don't know why I need to do that, do you?
6232034	eng	The only one here who can probably do that is Tom.
6232035	eng	Tom told me that he thought you could probably do that.
6232036	eng	I can't make Tom do that.
6232037	eng	You still don't know why I have to do that, do you?
6232038	eng	The last time I saw Tom he was wearing a blue cap.
6232039	eng	Tom told me he's been living in Boston for three years.
6232040	eng	I believed what Tom said.
6232041	eng	You should try doing that while you're still young.
6232042	eng	That was the first time Tom had ever been injured.
6232043	eng	Tom told me he wanted to wait until October to do that.
6232044	eng	I appreciated Tom's help.
6232045	eng	You only did that because you had no choice, right?
6232046	eng	That was the first time I'd ever seen Tom do that.
6232047	eng	Tom told me he planned to wait until Monday to do that.
6232048	eng	How long was Tom married?
6232049	eng	You know we weren't supposed to do that, don't you?
6232050	eng	That was the first time I ever saw Tom doing that.
6232051	eng	Tom thought he might be required to do that by himself.
6232052	eng	How did Tom go to Boston?
6232053	eng	You know that I'm not likely to do that, don't you?
6232054	eng	Since Tom isn't feeling well, he won't do that with us.
6232055	eng	Tom suggested that I do that tomorrow instead of today.
6232056	eng	Hasn't Tom done that yet?
6232057	eng	You know that I'm not afraid to do that, don't you?
6232058	eng	Please tell Tom that he isn't required to do that.
6232059	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he didn't want to do that.
6232060	eng	Has Tom broken any rules?
6232061	eng	You know that I'm determined to do that, don't you?
6232062	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to get that done by 2:30.
6232063	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he didn't need to do that.
6232064	eng	Doing that made Tom sick.
6232065	eng	You knew doing that would be difficult, didn't you?
6232066	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to get here early.
6232067	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he didn't have to do that.
6232068	eng	Doesn't Tom teach French?
6232069	eng	You knew I'd wouldn't agree to do that, didn't you?
6232070	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to bring anything.
6232071	eng	Tom started crying the minute his mother left the room.
6232072	eng	Doesn't Tom study French?
6232073	eng	You knew I'd have to do that by myself, didn't you?
6232074	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that I hardly ever do that.
6232075	eng	Tom spends more time thinking about work than doing it.
6232076	eng	Doesn't Tom speak French?
6232077	eng	You knew I wouldn't be able to do that, didn't you?
6232078	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that I don't often do that.
6232079	eng	Tom should've been glad that he didn't have to do that.
6232080	eng	Does Tom need to do that?
6232081	eng	You hope to be the first one to do that, don't you?
6232082	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that again.
6232083	eng	Tom should've been able to finish doing that yesterday.
6232084	eng	Do you like Tom's design?
6232085	eng	You hope that you won't have to do that, don't you?
6232086	eng	It was very considerate of you to do that for Tom.
6232087	eng	Tom should do that, because it's the right thing to do.
6232088	eng	Did Tom buy that for you?
6232089	eng	You have to go to Boston next Monday for a meeting.
6232090	eng	If Tom says that he wants to do that, ask him why.
6232091	eng	Tom seemed to be very interested in what was happening.
6232092	eng	Can you buy that for Tom?
6232093	eng	You don't think I'm going to do that again, do you?
6232094	eng	I've promised Tom I wouldn't go to Boston anymore.
6232095	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him what had happened.
6232096	eng	Ask Tom if he'll do that.
6232097	eng	You don't think I'll be allowed to do that, do you?
6232098	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to do that.
6232099	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him he had to do that.
6232100	eng	Ask Tom if he needs help.
6232101	eng	You don't seem to understand why I need to do that.
6232102	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be interested in doing that.
6232103	eng	Tom says he's gotten plenty of support from his family.
6232104	eng	You look older than Tom.
6232105	eng	You don't really think I wanted to do that, do you?
6232106	eng	I'm sure Tom would appreciate any help he can get.
6232107	eng	Tom says he thinks he'll be able to do that by himself.
6232108	eng	You look a lot like Tom.
6232109	eng	You don't really think I needed to do that, do you?
6232110	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be here the day after tomorrow.
6232111	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why the meeting was postponed.
6232112	eng	You look a bit like Tom.
6232113	eng	You don't really plan to stay up all night, do you?
6232114	eng	I'm sure Tom will be broke by the end of the week.
6232115	eng	Tom says he doesn't have many opportunities to do that.
6232116	eng	Why's Tom afraid of you?
6232117	eng	You don't have to talk about it if I don't want to.
6232118	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom will never do that again.
6232119	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe you really want to do that.
6232120	eng	Why didn't Tom help you?
6232121	eng	You don't believe I really have to do that, do you?
6232122	eng	I won't tell Tom that I don't know how to do that.
6232123	eng	Tom says he can't stand people who do things like that.
6232124	eng	Why did that bother Tom?
6232125	eng	You didn't know I was supposed to do that, did you?
6232126	eng	I wish you hadn't told Tom I hadn't done that yet.
6232127	eng	Tom says birds wake him up every morning in the summer.
6232128	eng	Why did Tom leave early?
6232129	eng	You didn't know I was finished doing that, did you?
6232130	eng	I wish I'd remembered to send Tom a birthday card.
6232131	eng	Tom sat on the floor surrounded by a bunch of children.
6232132	eng	Who'll do that with Tom?
6232133	eng	You didn't have the permission to do that, did you?
6232134	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom that I forgot to do that.
6232135	eng	Tom sat at the kitchen table and listened to the radio.
6232136	eng	We heard Tom doing that.
6232137	eng	You could stop us from doing that if you wanted to.
6232138	eng	I wish I hadn't promised Tom I'd help him do that.
6232139	eng	Tom said we needed at least $300 to buy what we needed.
6232140	eng	We asked Tom to help us.
6232141	eng	We've been told not to try doing that by ourselves.
6232142	eng	I went swimming with Tom the day before yesterday.
6232143	eng	Tom said that probably won't happen in the near future.
6232144	eng	Was it Tom who did that?
6232145	eng	We'll stay inside all day even if it isn't raining.
6232146	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he couldn't do that.
6232147	eng	Tom said that probably won't happen again anytime soon.
6232148	eng	Was Tom waiting for you?
6232149	eng	We have to go to Boston next weekend for a wedding.
6232150	eng	I want to know why Tom isn't working here anymore.
6232151	eng	Tom said that his doctor told him not to smoke anymore.
6232152	eng	Warn Tom not to do that.
6232153	eng	We don't usually get very many customers on Monday.
6232154	eng	I want to know how much time Tom spent doing that.
6232155	eng	Tom said that he thought doing that would be dangerous.
6232156	eng	Those aren't Tom's cats.
6232157	eng	We can't come to Boston for Thanksgiving this year.
6232158	eng	I waited for Tom all afternoon, but he never came.
6232159	eng	Tom said that he didn't think doing that would be safe.
6232160	eng	These pens aren't Tom's.
6232161	eng	We always get a lot of donations this time of year.
6232162	eng	I told Tom to stay in Boston for a few more weeks.
6232163	eng	Tom said that he didn't think doing that would be easy.
6232164	eng	These glasses are Tom's.
6232165	eng	The police chief said no arrests had been made yet.
6232166	eng	I told Tom that I wanted to go to Boston with him.
6232167	eng	Tom said it's important that we do what we can to help.
6232168	eng	The drink made Tom sick.
6232169	eng	The girl sitting next to me on the bus seemed sick.
6232170	eng	I told Tom not to do that the way he was doing it.
6232171	eng	Tom said he'll probably do that the day after tomorrow.
6232172	eng	Tell Tom not to do that.
6232173	eng	That's a problem that still needs to be dealt with.
6232174	eng	I told Tom I thought I was going to die in prison.
6232175	eng	Tom said he wouldn't have enough time to do that today.
6232176	eng	Should Tom go to Boston?
6232177	eng	That movie wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
6232178	eng	I told Tom I didn't know any other way to do that.
6232179	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be able to do that in three hours.
6232180	eng	Perhaps Tom can do that.
6232181	eng	Please give me a little more time to consider that.
6232182	eng	I thought you said you'd never ask Tom to do that.
6232183	eng	Tom said he would've done that if he'd known he had to.
6232184	eng	My answer surprised Tom.
6232185	eng	People don't visit Boston as often as they used to.
6232186	eng	I thought you said you'd keep Tom from doing that.
6232187	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't left his windows unlocked.
6232188	eng	Maybe Tom isn't at home.
6232189	eng	One of the names on the list seemed familiar to me.
6232190	eng	I thought you said you wanted to do that with Tom.
6232191	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't had to do that by himself.
6232192	eng	Is Tom still doing that?
6232193	eng	One of the men waiting in line seemed very nervous.
6232194	eng	I thought you said you promised Tom you'd do that.
6232195	eng	Tom said he was very concerned about what might happen.
6232196	eng	Is Tom really in Boston?
6232197	eng	Let me show you this new hammer that I just bought.
6232198	eng	I thought Tom would be through doing that by 2:30.
6232199	eng	Tom said he usually goes to Boston three times a month.
6232200	eng	Is Tom ready to do that?
6232201	eng	It's not easy to get here by public transportation.
6232202	eng	I thought Tom would be present at today's meeting.
6232203	eng	Tom said he thought it wouldn't be possible to do that.
6232204	eng	I'm sure Tom will be up.
6232205	eng	It's important that you learn to do that correctly.
6232206	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask you not to do that.
6232207	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that by himself.
6232208	eng	I'll ask Tom to do that.
6232209	eng	It's important for us to do that while we're young.
6232210	eng	I thought Tom was better at doing that than I was.
6232211	eng	Tom said he thought he would be able to do that for me.
6232212	eng	I wonder why Tom is sad.
6232213	eng	It's getting cold in here. Let's close the windows?
6232214	eng	I thought Tom said he didn't know how to get here.
6232215	eng	Tom said he thought he might not be allowed to do that.
6232216	eng	I wonder if Tom is sick.
6232217	eng	It would probably be unsafe to do that by yourself.
6232218	eng	I thought Tom might be permitted to do that again.
6232219	ukr	Чи можу я тут казати це?
6232220	eng	Tom said he thought he might need to do that this week.
6232221	eng	I wonder if Tom is safe.
6232222	eng	It would probably be stupid to do that by yourself.
6232223	eng	I thought Tom didn't enjoy watching horror movies.
6232224	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that this week.
6232225	eng	I wonder if Tom is rich.
6232226	eng	It would be fantastic if we could do that together.
6232227	eng	I thought I was supposed to meet Tom here at 2:30.
6232228	eng	Tom said he thought doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
6232229	eng	I wonder if Tom is home.
6232230	eng	It wasn't in Boston that we met. It was in Chicago.
6232231	eng	I think you should try to persuade Tom to do that.
6232232	eng	Tom said he only eats vegetables that he grows himself.
6232233	eng	I wonder if Tom is here.
6232234	eng	It probably wouldn't be fun to do that by yourself.
6232235	eng	I think Tom would like to be able to speak French.
6232236	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be able to learn how to do that.
6232237	eng	I wonder if Tom is done.
6232238	eng	It probably would be unsafe to do that by yourself.
6232239	eng	I think Tom would be embarrassed if that happened.
6232240	eng	Tom said he doesn't understand why you want to do that.
6232241	eng	I wonder if Tom is dead.
6232242	eng	If you're busy tomorrow, you don't have to do that.
6232243	eng	I think Tom won't be in his office this afternoon.
6232244	eng	Tom said he doesn't think it's safe for you to do that.
6232245	eng	I wonder if Tom is cold.
6232246	eng	If you have some free time, let's do that together.
6232247	eng	I think Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
6232248	eng	Tom said he doesn't have many opportunities to do that.
6232249	eng	I watched Tom swim laps.
6232250	eng	If we were to go to Boston, how would we get there?
6232251	eng	I think Tom might get hurt if he tries to do that.
6232252	eng	Tom said I didn't speak French well enough for the job.
6232253	eng	I was going to kiss Tom.
6232254	eng	If we do that now, we won't have to do it tomorrow.
6232255	eng	I think Tom isn't sure that's what he needs to do.
6232256	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's not supposed to do that.
6232257	eng	I was going to help Tom.
6232258	eng	If I'd been there, I wouldn't have let you do that.
6232259	eng	I think Tom couldn't stop himself from doing that.
6232260	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he shouldn't do that anymore.
6232261	eng	I wanted to talk to Tom.
6232262	eng	I'm the only one who won't be at the meeting today.
6232263	eng	I think Tom could get hurt if he tries to do that.
6232264	eng	Tom often refuses to eat what his mother makes for him.
6232265	eng	I wanted to go with Tom.
6232266	eng	I'm the only one who has to do that again tomorrow.
6232267	eng	I think Tom could be happy here if he tried to be.
6232268	eng	Tom needs to make sure that he has everything he needs.
6232269	eng	I want to see Tom dance.
6232270	eng	I'm sure you could do that if you really wanted to.
6232271	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I'm going to do that.
6232272	eng	Tom must've missed the train he was supposed to get on.
6232273	eng	I told Tom I was lonely.
6232274	eng	I'm now thinking about whether or not I'll do that.
6232275	eng	I should tell Tom that he doesn't need to do that.
6232276	eng	Tom laid the magazine he had been reading on the table.
6232277	eng	I thought Tom was upset.
6232278	eng	I'd rather do that now while it's still not so hot.
6232279	eng	I should tell Tom that he doesn't have to do that.
6232280	eng	Tom knew he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6232281	eng	I thought Tom was tired.
6232282	eng	I wouldn't have gone to Boston if I didn't have to.
6232283	eng	I should probably tell Tom that he has to do that.
6232284	eng	Tom is the only person I know who can probably do that.
6232285	eng	I thought Tom was right.
6232286	eng	I won't be able to go to Boston with you next week.
6232287	eng	I knew it wasn't the first time Tom had done that.
6232288	eng	Tom is the only one who volunteered to help us do that.
6232289	eng	I thought Tom was ready.
6232290	eng	I was told that I wouldn't be permitted to do that.
6232291	eng	I knew Tom was making a lot more money than I was.
6232292	eng	Tom is still the same friendly person he's always been.
6232293	eng	I thought Tom was lying.
6232294	eng	I want to spend time with my children this weekend.
6232295	eng	I hope Tom isn't glad that that's going to happen.
6232296	eng	Tom is probably in front of the school waiting for you.
6232297	eng	I thought Tom was first.
6232298	eng	I want to make sure that that doesn't happen again.
6232299	eng	I got to know Tom while I was in Boston last year.
6232300	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who'll need to do that.
6232301	eng	I thought Tom was drunk.
6232302	eng	I want to get my driver's license as soon as I can.
6232303	eng	I forgot to tell Tom to be there tomorrow at 2:30.
6232304	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who'll have to do that.
6232306	eng	I thought you were supposed to be here last Monday.
6232307	eng	I finally found the courage to ask Tom to do that.
6232308	eng	Tom is on both the soccer team and the basketball team.
6232309	eng	I thought Tom was broke.
6232310	eng	I thought you said you wanted to do that last week.
6232311	eng	I doubt very seriously that that'll impress Tom.
6232312	eng	Tom has two daughter who are married and one who isn't.
6232313	eng	I thought Tom was bored.
6232314	eng	I thought you didn't to know how to play the piano.
6232315	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be suspended.
6232316	eng	Tom has no close friends to help him with his problems.
6232317	eng	I thought Tom was awake.
6232318	eng	I think that I can go to Boston with you next week.
6232319	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be irritated.
6232320	eng	Tom has just finished reading a book written in French.
6232321	eng	I thought Tom was alone.
6232322	eng	I studied French really intensely for about a year.
6232323	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be impressed.
6232324	eng	Tom has decided to stay in Boston for three more weeks.
6232325	eng	I think it's Tom's turn.
6232326	eng	I should've been able to do that without your help.
6232327	eng	I don't want to talk to Tom, but I have no choice.
6232328	eng	Tom has already told me he doesn't know how to do that.
6232329	eng	I think Tom is unafraid.
6232330	eng	I might need to stay in Boston for a few more days.
6232331	eng	I don't want to say anything that might upset Tom.
6232332	eng	Tom has a couple of friends who speak French very well.
6232333	eng	I think Tom is ticklish.
6232334	eng	I might be able to go to Boston with you next week.
6232335	eng	I don't think it would be safe for Tom to do that.
6232336	eng	Tom had a calendar hanging on the wall behind his desk.
6232337	eng	I think Tom is relieved.
6232338	eng	I left my hat somewhere and I can't remember where.
6232339	eng	I don't think Tom will be the next one to do that.
6232340	eng	Tom escaped from prison through a tunnel that he found.
6232341	eng	I think Tom is finished.
6232342	eng	I know I shouldn't have tried to do that by myself.
6232343	eng	I don't think Tom will be the last one to do that.
6232344	eng	Tom doesn't want to go outside on a cold day like this.
6232345	eng	I think Tom is divorced.
6232346	eng	I keep making the same mistake over and over again.
6232347	eng	I don't think Tom will be in his office on Monday.
6232348	eng	Tom doesn't think that the judge's decision was unfair.
6232349	eng	I think Tom is autistic.
6232350	eng	I just found out that you used to be a taxi driver.
6232351	eng	I don't think Tom will be busy tomorrow afternoon.
6232352	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that would be a good idea.
6232353	eng	I spoke French with Tom.
6232354	eng	I have three volunteers who are helping me do that.
6232355	eng	I don't think Tom really wants to do that anymore.
6232356	eng	Tom doesn't think he'll have the time to do that today.
6232357	eng	I should've trusted Tom.
6232358	eng	I don't want to admit I didn't know how to do that.
6232359	eng	I don't think Tom really needs to do that anymore.
6232360	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he ought to do that.
6232361	eng	I should've married Tom.
6232362	eng	I don't understand why I'm not supposed to do that.
6232363	eng	I don't think Tom really had to do that yesterday.
6232364	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he needs to do that.
6232365	eng	I should've invited Tom.
6232366	eng	I don't think you should be doing that by yourself.
6232367	eng	I don't think Tom needs to do that until tomorrow.
6232368	eng	Tom doesn't really know French well enough to teach it.
6232369	eng	I really don't like Tom.
6232370	eng	I don't think that doing that would be a good idea.
6232371	eng	I don't think Tom could do that without some help.
6232372	eng	Tom doesn't like speaking in French and I don't either.
6232373	eng	I often see Tom do that.
6232374	eng	I don't think I'm smart enough to get into Harvard.
6232375	eng	I don't think I should tell Tom what I have to do.
6232376	eng	Tom doesn't know who's living in the house next to his.
6232377	eng	I never saw Tom do that.
6232378	eng	I don't really know French well enough to teach it.
6232379	eng	I don't really expect Tom to answer that question.
6232380	eng	Tom doesn't know who he should ask to help him do that.
6232381	eng	I know why Tom is upset.
6232382	eng	I don't mind if you start eating before I get home.
6232383	eng	I don't like the same kind of music that Tom does.
6232384	eng	Tom doesn't have to wash the car if he doesn't want to.
6232385	eng	I know why Tom is tired.
6232386	eng	I don't know how to deal with that kind of problem.
6232387	eng	I don't like the same kind of books that Tom does.
6232388	eng	Tom doesn't have to say anything if he doesn't want to.
6232389	eng	I know that Tom is weak.
6232390	eng	I don't know for sure whether I can do that or not.
6232391	eng	I don't like mushroom soup and Tom doesn't either.
6232392	eng	Tom didn't want to admit he didn't know how to do that.
6232393	eng	I know that Tom is tall.
6232394	eng	I don't have the power to stop that from happening.
6232395	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't want me at his party.
6232396	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he shouldn't do that.
6232397	eng	I know that Tom is sick.
6232398	eng	I don't have enough time to do what has to be done.
6232399	eng	I don't know who Tom is planning to see in Boston.
6232400	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he needed to do that.
6232401	eng	I know that Tom is safe.
6232402	eng	I don't have enough money to buy everything I want.
6232403	eng	I don't know whether what Tom says is true or not.
6232404	eng	Tom didn't know how much money he should take with him.
6232405	eng	I know that Tom is rich.
6232406	eng	I didn't want to spend the rest of my life in jail.
6232407	eng	I don't know whether Tom is good at skiing or not.
6232408	eng	Tom didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that by myself.
6232409	eng	I know that Tom is poor.
6232410	eng	I didn't think you'd be here, but I'm glad you are.
6232411	eng	I don't know whether Tom is good at French or not.
6232412	eng	Tom could've been suspicious, but he didn't seem to be.
6232413	eng	I know that Tom is nice.
6232414	eng	I didn't think that's what we should've been doing.
6232415	eng	I don't know when Tom is planning to go to Boston.
6232416	eng	Tom could've been frightened, but he didn't seem to be.
6232417	eng	I know that Tom is lost.
6232418	eng	I didn't think I would be the first one to do that.
6232419	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't the one who did that.
6232420	eng	Tom could refuse to do that, but I don't think he will.
6232421	eng	I know that Tom is lazy.
6232422	eng	I didn't take the medicine that the doctor gave me.
6232423	eng	I don't know how Tom was able to afford a new car.
6232424	eng	Tom could force you to do that, but I doubt if he will.
6232425	eng	I know that Tom is kind.
6232426	eng	I didn't really have to come into the office today.
6232427	eng	I don't care whether Tom does his homework or not.
6232428	eng	Tom could be sleepy. He got up very early this morning.
6232429	eng	I know that Tom is home.
6232430	eng	I didn't realize I shouldn't have tried doing that.
6232431	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom about what had happened.
6232432	eng	Tom continues to deny that he was the one who did that.
6232433	eng	I know that Tom is here.
6232434	eng	I didn't know you were still a high school student.
6232435	eng	I didn't want to talk to Tom, but I had no choice.
6232436	eng	Tom asked whose coat it was and I told him it was mine.
6232437	eng	I know that Tom is fine.
6232438	eng	I didn't know what was in the big box on the table.
6232439	eng	I didn't want to do anything that would upset Tom.
6232440	eng	Tom and his girlfriend were here together this morning.
6232441	eng	I know that Tom is deaf.
6232442	eng	I didn't know what time I was supposed to be there.
6232443	eng	I didn't want to bother Tom while he was studying.
6232444	eng	Tom and I've decided not to go to Boston for Christmas.
6232445	eng	I know that Tom is dead.
6232446	eng	I didn't know we weren't supposed to do that today.
6232447	eng	I didn't think Tom would be exhausted, but he was.
6232448	eng	Tom and I want to spend the rest of our lives together.
6232449	eng	I know that Tom is cold.
6232450	eng	I didn't know that you wouldn't be able to do that.
6232451	eng	I didn't think Tom would be doing that by himself.
6232452	eng	Tom and I used to visit each other every other weekend.
6232453	eng	I know that Tom is bald.
6232454	eng	I didn't know that you wanted to do that on Monday.
6232455	eng	I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
6232456	eng	Tom and I often sit on the porch together after dinner.
6232457	eng	I know how Tom got rich.
6232458	eng	I didn't know that what we were doing wasn't legal.
6232459	eng	I didn't think Tom would be at school last Monday.
6232460	eng	Tom and I couldn't agree on what color curtains to buy.
6232461	eng	I know how Tom got hurt.
6232462	eng	I didn't know I didn't have enough time to do that.
6232463	eng	I didn't think Tom really needed to do that today.
6232464	eng	Tom almost froze to death when he fell through the ice.
6232465	eng	I know Tom's dog's name.
6232466	eng	I didn't have time to do everything had to be done.
6232467	eng	I didn't think I would be awake when Tom got home.
6232468	eng	Tom admitted that that was the real reason he did that.
6232469	eng	I know Tom likes reggae.
6232470	eng	I didn't have time to do everything I wanted to do.
6232471	eng	I didn't thank Tom enough for all the work he did.
6232472	eng	Tom would be able to do that if he put his mind to it.
6232473	eng	I knew why Tom did that.
6232474	eng	I didn't get a driver's license until I was thirty.
6232475	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I'd be in Boston this week.
6232476	eng	Tom won't likely be as busy today as he was yesterday.
6232477	eng	I knew Tom's first wife.
6232478	eng	I didn't figure out how to do that until yesterday.
6232479	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I didn't intend to do that.
6232480	eng	Tom will likely be curious why you decided to do that.
6232481	eng	I hope Tom will help me.
6232482	eng	I didn't do that because I didn't have enough time.
6232483	eng	I didn't tell Tom anything he didn't already know.
6232484	eng	Tom will come back from Boston this week or next week.
6232485	eng	I hope Tom never leaves.
6232486	eng	I can understand why you might not want to do that.
6232487	eng	I didn't really think Tom would refuse to do that.
6232488	eng	Tom will be able to do that if he puts his mind to it.
6232489	eng	I hope Tom isn't sleepy.
6232490	eng	How often do you change the strings on your guitar?
6232491	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wasn't enjoying himself.
6232492	eng	Tom wasn't able to remember where he put his passport.
6232493	eng	I hope Tom isn't scared.
6232494	eng	How much time do you estimate is needed to do that?
6232495	eng	I didn't let Tom finish what he was trying to say.
6232496	eng	Tom was the only other person who should've done that.
6232497	eng	I hope Tom isn't lonely.
6232498	eng	How many months do you think it'll take to do that?
6232499	eng	I didn't know why Tom couldn't go camping with us.
6232500	eng	Tom was the first person to ever ask me that question.
6232501	eng	I hope Tom isn't grumpy.
6232502	eng	How many hamburgers do you think you ate last year?
6232503	eng	I didn't know who Tom wanted to go to Boston with.
6232504	eng	Tom was the first one to volunteer to help us do that.
6232505	eng	I hope Tom isn't biased.
6232506	eng	How many cups of coffee did you drink this morning?
6232507	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
6232508	eng	Tom was smart enough to not try doing that by himself.
6232509	eng	I hope Tom isn't afraid.
6232510	eng	How many churches do you think there are in Boston?
6232511	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to be here today.
6232512	eng	Tom was smart enough not to try doing that by himself.
6232513	eng	I hope Tom is surprised.
6232514	eng	How long does it take to get the airport from here?
6232515	eng	I didn't know Tom had never been to Boston before.
6232516	eng	Tom used to be able to play the saxophone fairly well.
6232517	eng	I hope Tom is skeptical.
6232518	eng	Have you heard about what happened in Boston today?
6232519	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom, but I thought I should.
6232520	eng	Tom told me that he's curious about why that happened.
6232521	eng	I hope Tom is organized.
6232522	eng	Even though it'll take a lot of time, I'll do that.
6232523	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what Tom wanted.
6232524	eng	Tom told me that he was very hungry when he got home.
6232525	eng	I hope Tom is objective.
6232526	eng	Don't you think it would be interesting to do that?
6232527	eng	I didn't apply for the job that Tom told me about.
6232528	eng	Tom told me that he was the one who needed to do that.
6232529	eng	I hope Tom is impressed.
6232530	eng	Doing that wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
6232531	eng	I completely forgot that Tom would do that for us.
6232532	eng	Tom told me that he thought my speech was interesting.
6232533	eng	I hope Tom is impartial.
6232534	eng	Doing that was more fun than I thought it would be.
6232535	eng	I can't believe Tom is really planning to do that.
6232536	eng	Tom told me that I should do that as soon as possible.
6232537	eng	I hope Tom is concerned.
6232538	eng	Do you really think it would be foolish to do that?
6232539	eng	I bet Tom thirty dollars that he couldn't do that.
6232540	eng	Tom told me last month that he was planning to retire.
6232541	eng	I hope Tom gets the job.
6232542	eng	Do you really think doing that would be impossible?
6232543	eng	I asked Tom if he wanted to go to a movie with me.
6232544	eng	Tom told me he didn't know what he was supposed to do.
6232545	eng	I helped Tom onto the bus.
6232546	eng	Do you really think doing that would be depressing?
6232547	eng	How many more years do you think Tom will do that?
6232548	eng	Tom thought he wouldn't be able to do that by himself.
6232549	eng	I helped Tom dig a hole.
6232550	eng	Do you plan on living in Boston after you graduate?
6232551	eng	How many more weeks do you think Tom will do that?
6232552	eng	Tom thought he might be allowed to do that by himself.
6232553	eng	I expect Tom to do that.
6232554	eng	Did you know that very few people actually do that?
6232555	eng	How many more hours do you think Tom will do that?
6232556	eng	Tom still doesn't understand what he's supposed to do.
6232557	eng	I don't think Tom is up.
6232558	eng	Did you know it was possible to get there by train?
6232559	eng	Don't forget to tell Tom about tomorrow's meeting.
6232560	eng	Tom still does that, even though we've told me not to.
6232561	eng	I don't think Tom is in.
6232562	eng	After a lot of hard thinking, I decided to do that.
6232563	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be cheaper.
6232564	eng	Tom shouldn't have been doing that in the first place.
6232565	eng	I didn't drive Tom home.
6232566	eng	About how many times do you think you've done that?
6232567	eng	Do you think Tom can do that without getting hurt?
6232568	eng	Tom should've been the one responsible for doing that.
6232569	eng	I didn't agree with Tom.
6232570	eng	"Will you do that tomorrow?" "No, I don't plan to."
6232571	eng	Do you know anything about the school Tom goes to?
6232572	eng	Tom should've been able to answer all those questions.
6232573	eng	I decided to follow Tom.
6232574	eng	You're the only one who ever really understood me.
6232575	eng	Do you know Tom well enough to ask him to do that?
6232576	eng	Tom should tell his friends that he's going to Boston.
6232577	eng	I could do that for Tom.
6232578	eng	You're the first person to ever ask me to do that.
6232579	eng	Didn't you know that Tom isn't really from Boston?
6232580	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him I had to do that.
6232581	eng	How long was Tom asleep?
6232582	eng	You're not the only one who's supposed to do that.
6232583	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still planning to do that?
6232584	eng	Tom says this will be the last time he ever does this.
6232586	eng	You're not the only one who's not able to do that.
6232587	eng	Didn't you know Tom lived with his aunt and uncle?
6232588	eng	Tom says this will be the last time he ever does that.
6232589	eng	Even Tom was doing that.
6232590	eng	You're not the only one who knows what's going on.
6232591	eng	Didn't you know Tom likes watching baseball on TV?
6232592	eng	Tom says there was no reason why he shouldn't do that.
6232593	eng	Does Tom work in Boston?
6232594	eng	You're able to do just about anything, aren't you?
6232595	eng	Didn't you know Tom could hear everything we said?
6232596	eng	Tom says he thought he could do that without any help.
6232597	eng	Does Tom always do that?
6232598	eng	You're a high school senior this year, aren't you?
6232599	eng	Did you know there was another Tom at this school?
6232600	eng	Tom says he thinks it might be interesting to do that.
6232601	eng	Did Tom have to do that?
6232602	eng	You'll never be able to do that without some help.
6232603	eng	You're not supposed to help Tom do that, are you?
6232604	eng	Tom says he has something he has to do this afternoon.
6232605	eng	Did Tom break any rules?
6232606	eng	You'll have to do that even if you don't want to.
6232607	eng	You'll try to persuade Tom to do that, won't you?
6232608	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how to swim very well.
6232609	eng	Can Tom buy that for us?
6232610	eng	You'll be through doing that by Monday, won't you?
6232611	eng	You'll try to convince Tom to do that, won't you?
6232612	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how to surf very well.
6232613	eng	Both Tom and I are rich.
6232614	eng	You'd be disappointed if I did that, wouldn't you?
6232615	eng	You'd be surprised if Tom did that, wouldn't you?
6232616	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe you would do that for him.
6232617	eng	Why's Tom afraid of me?
6232618	eng	You weren't supposed to help me do that, were you?
6232619	eng	You'd be impressed if Tom did that, wouldn't you?
6232620	eng	Tom says he believes he can do that without your help.
6232621	eng	When was Tom in Boston?
6232622	eng	You weren't given the chance to do that, were you?
6232623	eng	You won't be able to convince Tom not to do that.
6232624	eng	Tom said there wasn't anything he could do about that.
6232625	eng	What's Tom reading now?
6232626	eng	You weren't able to do that by yourself, were you?
6232627	eng	You weren't sure Tom needed to do that, were you?
6232628	eng	Tom said there was still a lot that needed to be done.
6232629	eng	What should I give Tom?
6232630	eng	You were told to do that by yourself, weren't you?
6232631	eng	You weren't able to get Tom to do that, were you?
6232632	eng	Tom said that just doing that wouldn't be good enough.
6232633	eng	What else has Tom done?
6232634	eng	You were the first person to do that, weren't you?
6232635	eng	You were inspired to do that by Tom, weren't you?
6232636	eng	Tom said that it probably wouldn't rain until evening.
6232637	eng	Was Tom in class today?
6232638	eng	You were finished doing that by 2:30, weren't you?
6232639	eng	You were hoping to do that with Tom, weren't you?
6232640	eng	Tom said that he wasn't working as bricklayer anymore.
6232641	eng	This umbrella is Tom's.
6232642	eng	You want to be the next one to do that, don't you?
6232643	eng	You tried to persuade Tom to do that, didn't you?
6232644	eng	Tom said that Mozart is one of his favorite composers.
6232645	eng	This suitcase is Tom's.
6232646	eng	You want to be the last one to do that, don't you?
6232647	eng	You tried to convince Tom to do that, didn't you?
6232648	eng	Tom said that I don't need to sing if I don't want to.
6232649	eng	These are Tom's gloves.
6232650	eng	You want to be excused from doing that, don't you?
6232651	eng	You told Tom that you didn't do that, didn't you?
6232652	eng	Tom said that I don't have to sing if I don't want to.
6232653	eng	The police stopped Tom.
6232654	eng	You thought I was finished doing that, didn't you?
6232655	vie	Layla buộc phải bấm còi.
6232657	eng	Can I say it here?
6232658	fra	Elle croisa ses longues jambes fuselées.
6232659	vie	Layla muốn thành y tá.
6232660	eng	You told Tom that I couldn't do that, didn't you?
6232661	eng	Tom said he's very hungry every day when he gets home.
6232662	eng	The food made Tom sick.
6232663	eng	You thought I didn't enjoy doing that, didn't you?
6232664	eng	You thought Tom was doing that today, didn't you?
6232665	eng	Tom said he's glad you were able to do that yesterday.
6232666	eng	Tell Tom it isn't true.
6232667	eng	You thought I could do that by myself, didn't you?
6232668	eng	You should've told Tom that he needed to do that.
6232669	eng	Tom said he's content with the deal he's been offered.
6232670	eng	Tell Tom I don't drink.
6232671	eng	You still do that as often as possible, don't you?
6232672	eng	You should tell Tom that you want him to do that.
6232673	eng	Tom said he'd probably do that the day after tomorrow.
6232674	eng	May I do that with Tom?
6232675	eng	You still aren't very good at doing that, are you?
6232676	eng	You should probably tell Tom you want to do that.
6232677	eng	Tom said he'd like you to do that as soon as possible.
6232678	eng	Let's have Tom do that.
6232679	eng	You shouldn't do that with just anybody, you know.
6232680	eng	You should let Tom know that you want to do that.
6232681	eng	Tom said he would be able to do that without any help.
6232682	eng	Let's do that with Tom.
6232683	eng	You should've been able to do that in three hours.
6232684	eng	You should let Tom know that you need to do that.
6232685	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to get here until after 2:30.
6232686	eng	Is Tom still on a diet?
6232687	eng	You should make sure that you get that done today.
6232688	eng	You should let Tom know that you have to do that.
6232689	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to get here until about 2:30.
6232690	eng	Is Tom still a student?
6232691	eng	You should make sure that you don't do that today.
6232692	eng	You should do that the way Tom told you to do it.
6232693	eng	Tom said he was too out of shape to go hiking with us.
6232694	eng	Is Tom still a plumber?
6232695	eng	You ought to stay in Boston for a couple of weeks.
6232696	eng	You should be able to do that without Tom's help.
6232697	eng	Tom said he wanted to replace the drummer in his band.
6232698	eng	Is Tom really sleeping?
6232699	eng	You never thought I'd be able to do that, did you?
6232700	eng	You know Tom won't be able to do that, don't you?
6232701	eng	Tom said he tried to do that the day before yesterday.
6232702	eng	I've only met Tom once.
6232703	eng	You never had the opportunity to do that, did you?
6232704	eng	You know Tom no longer has to do that, don't you?
6232705	eng	Tom said he thought it would be impossible to do that.
6232706	eng	I'd ask Tom to do that.
6232707	eng	You never expected to be able to do that, did you?
6232708	eng	You knew Tom would ask me to do that, didn't you?
6232709	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that on Monday.
6232710	eng	I wonder if Tom is sad.
6232711	eng	You know why I was supposed to do that, don't you?
6232712	eng	You knew Tom was unlikely to do that, didn't you?
6232713	eng	Tom said he thought he would be able to do that today.
6232714	eng	I wonder if Tom is mad.
6232715	eng	You know we aren't supposed to do that, don't you?
6232716	eng	You knew Tom was supposed to do that, didn't you?
6232717	eng	Tom said he thought he might not have to do that here.
6232718	eng	I won't help Tom again.
6232719	eng	You know that I'm not eager to do that, don't you?
6232720	eng	You hope that Tom won't do that again, don't you?
6232721	eng	Tom said he knew he might not need to do that anymore.
6232722	eng	I won't go without Tom.
6232723	eng	You know I'm supposed to do that today, don't you?
6232724	eng	You don't think Tom has to do that today, do you?
6232725	eng	Tom said he knew he might not have to do that anymore.
6232726	eng	I wish Tom would leave.
6232727	eng	You know I'll never be able to do that, don't you?
6232728	eng	You don't seem convinced that Tom has to do that.
6232729	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be permitted to do that.
6232730	eng	I was at Tom's funeral.
6232731	eng	You knew I wasn't supposed to do that, didn't you?
6232732	eng	You don't really think Tom could do that, do you?
6232733	eng	Tom said he knew he might be required to do that soon.
6232734	eng	I want to work for Tom.
6232735	eng	You knew I wasn't planning to do that, didn't you?
6232736	eng	You don't know why Tom wanted to do that, do you?
6232737	eng	Tom said he knew he might be allowed to do that today.
6232738	eng	I want to surprise Tom.
6232739	eng	You hope to be excused from doing that, don't you?
6232740	eng	You don't know why Tom needed to do that, do you?
6232741	eng	Tom said he had something he had to do this afternoon.
6232742	eng	I want to get Tom back.
6232743	eng	You haven't done that since high school, have you?
6232744	eng	You didn't tell Tom I wanted to do that, did you?
6232745	eng	Tom said he doesn't think it would be wise to do that.
6232746	eng	I want to cheer Tom up.
6232747	eng	You don't have to wash the car if I don't want to.
6232748	eng	You didn't really expect Tom to do that, did you?
6232749	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he would be able to do that.
6232750	eng	I urged Tom to do that.
6232751	eng	You do that three or four times a week, don't you?
6232752	eng	You didn't know that Tom had to do that, did you?
6232753	eng	Tom said he doesn't have a problem with me doing that.
6232754	eng	I told Tom I'd do that.
6232755	eng	You didn't realize I knew how to do that, did you?
6232756	eng	You didn't know Tom would do that today, did you?
6232757	eng	Tom said he didn't want to pay so much for a used car.
6232758	eng	I told Tom I was tired.
6232759	eng	You didn't need to buy eggs. We already have some.
6232760	eng	You didn't know Tom had never done that, did you?
6232761	eng	Tom said he didn't want to mow the lawn until evening.
6232762	eng	I thought Tom was slow.
6232763	eng	You didn't know that I wanted to do that, did you?
6232764	eng	You didn't give Tom a chance to do that, did you?
6232765	eng	Tom said he didn't think doing that would be much fun.
6232766	eng	I thought Tom was last.
6232767	eng	You didn't know that I needed to do that, did you?
6232768	eng	You couldn't stop Tom from doing that, could you?
6232769	eng	Tom said he didn't remember where he'd parked the car.
6232770	eng	I thought Tom was here.
6232771	eng	You didn't know I didn't need to do that, did you?
6232772	eng	You asked Tom not to do that anymore, didn't you?
6232773	eng	Tom said he couldn't remember where he'd put his keys.
6232774	eng	I thought Tom was cute.
6232775	eng	You didn't know I didn't have to do that, did you?
6232776	eng	Would you like me to ask Tom to buy that for you?
6232777	eng	Tom said I didn't have to do that if I didn't want to.
6232778	eng	I thought Tom was busy.
6232779	eng	You didn't have enough energy to do that, did you?
6232780	eng	Why don't you get Tom to tell you how to do that?
6232781	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know he has to do that today.
6232782	eng	I thought Tom did that.
6232783	eng	You didn't do that as well as I thought you would.
6232784	eng	Why don't you get Tom to show you how to do that?
6232785	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why you want him to do that.
6232786	eng	I think Tom will agree.
6232787	eng	You did that in just a couple of days, didn't you?
6232788	eng	Why do you think Tom will be doing that tomorrow?
6232789	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's not likely to be fired.
6232790	eng	I think Tom is thirsty.
6232791	eng	You could probably do that later if you wanted to.
6232792	eng	Why are you so sure that Tom won't pass the exam?
6232793	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what he ought to do.
6232794	eng	I think Tom is strange.
6232795	eng	Why do you think I'm the only one who can do that?
6232796	eng	When did you decide not to permit Tom to do that?
6232797	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what he needs to do.
6232798	eng	I think Tom is starved.
6232799	eng	Why didn't you tell me that Mary was so beautiful?
6232800	eng	When I got home, Tom sleeping on the front porch.
6232801	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what has to be done.
6232802	eng	I think Tom is retired.
6232803	eng	What's the name of the movie we watched yesterday?
6232804	eng	This is a list of the medications that Tom takes.
6232805	eng	Tom probably doesn't know a lot about classical music.
6232806	eng	I think Tom is outside.
6232807	eng	What kind of websites do you visit the most often?
6232808	eng	There's no reason Tom has to know why I did that.
6232809	eng	Tom needs to stay in the hospital for a few more days.
6232810	eng	I think Tom is married.
6232811	eng	What color are you planning to paint your kitchen?
6232812	eng	The police said the search for Tom will continue.
6232813	eng	Tom knows where every light switch in the building is.
6232814	eng	I think Tom is excited.
6232815	eng	We need to stay in Boston for at least three days.
6232816	eng	The only one here who's afraid to do that is Tom.
6232817	eng	Tom knows me well enough to know that I won't do that.
6232818	eng	I think Tom is engaged.
6232819	eng	We didn't speak French at all until he was thirty.
6232820	eng	That was the first time Tom had ever been kissed.
6232821	eng	Tom isn't likely to be unenthusiastic about that.
6232822	eng	I think Tom is curious.
6232823	eng	We aren't likely to get paid extra for doing that.
6232824	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to do that today.
6232825	eng	Tom isn't likely to be troubled by what happened.
6232826	eng	I think Tom is bipolar.
6232827	eng	We always get a lot of visitors this time of year.
6232828	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't have to do that today.
6232829	eng	Tom isn't able to do that alone. You need to help him.
6232830	eng	I think Tom is annoyed.
6232831	eng	We always get a lot of tourists this time of year.
6232832	eng	Please make sure that Tom doesn't leave the yard.
6232833	eng	Tom is the only one working here who can speak French.
6232834	eng	I think Tom is adopted.
6232835	eng	This kind of snow isn't that unusual in this area.
6232836	eng	My parents wouldn't let me go to Boston with Tom.
6232837	eng	Tom is still not doing what he's supposed to be doing.
6232838	eng	I should've kissed Tom.
6232839	eng	This is the first time I've ever seen you do that.
6232840	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that I've never done that.
6232841	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who will need to do that.
6232842	eng	I should've called Tom.
6232843	eng	This elevator doesn't stop on odd-numbered floors.
6232844	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's got to do that today.
6232845	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who will have to do that.
6232846	eng	This book wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

6232852	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who wanted to do that.
6232853	eng	I know what annoys Tom.
6232854	eng	The man wearing the red baseball cap seemed angry.
6232855	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that here.
6232856	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who needed to do that.
6232857	eng	I know that Tom is shy.
6232858	eng	That wine wasn't as good as I thought it would be.
6232859	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly what he should do.
6232860	eng	Tom is likely to still be difficult to get along with.
6232861	eng	I know that Tom is sad.
6232862	eng	That was the first time I'd ever seen you do that.
6232863	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly what he has to do.
6232864	eng	Tom is likely to stay in Boston for at least three weeks.

6232868	eng	Tom hasn't yet returned the money he borrowed from me.
6232869	eng	I know that Tom is old.
6232870	eng	One of my bicycles is blue and the other is green.
6232871	eng	It's way past the time Tom promised he'd be here.
6232872	eng	Tom has promised to do that today before he goes home.
6232873	eng	I know that Tom is odd.
6232874	eng	My neighbor's dog kept me awake most of the night.
6232875	eng	It's been decided that Tom will do that tomorrow.
6232876	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what we ought to do.
6232877	eng	I know that Tom is fat.
6232878	eng	My car is in the parking lot behind this building.
6232879	eng	It'll probably be interesting for Tom to do that.
6232880	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what he needs to do.
6232881	eng	I know how to help Tom.
6232882	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be tough to do that by yourself.
6232883	eng	It didn't matter to Tom that the weather was bad.
6232884	eng	Tom has been to every one of his son's baseball games.
6232885	eng	I know how Tom got wet.
6232886	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be smart to do that by yourself.
6232887	eng	If you tell Tom what to do, I'm sure he'll do it.
6232888	eng	Tom has a lot money, but he doesn't have many friends.
6232889	eng	I know a boy named Tom.
6232890	eng	Many people have been complaining about the noise.
6232891	eng	I'm the only person here that Tom seems to trust.
6232892	eng	Tom finally graduated from college when he was thirty.
6232893	eng	I know Tom pretty well.
6232894	eng	Let's take a walk to the other side of the island.
6232895	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be lonely if you were here.
6232896	eng	Tom finally got a driver's license when he was thirty.
6232897	eng	I know Tom can do that.
6232898	eng	It's already been a half a month since I did that.
6232899	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be forgiven if he did that.
6232900	eng	Tom enjoys watching people do things that he can't do.
6232901	eng	I hope Tom isn't upset.
6232902	eng	It would probably be tough to do that by yourself.
6232903	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be lonely if he stays with us.
6232904	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that would be a bad idea.
6232905	eng	I hope Tom isn't tired.
6232906	eng	It would probably be smart to do that by yourself.
6232907	eng	I think Tom might be just a little too picky.
6232908	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that is such a good idea.
6232909	eng	I hope Tom isn't right.
6232910	eng	It would probably be risky to do that by yourself.
6232911	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if Tom wanted to do that.
6232912	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that is a very good idea.
6232913	eng	I hope Tom isn't early.
6232914	eng	It would be wonderful if you could do that for me.
6232915	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't have a driver's license.
6232916	eng	Tom doesn't think I'll have the time to do that today.
6232917	eng	I hope Tom isn't drunk.
6232918	eng	It would be stupid to try doing that by ourselves.
6232919	eng	I wonder if Tom is responsible for what happened.
6232920	eng	Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that anymore.
6232921	eng	I hope Tom isn't bored.
6232922	eng	It would be fantastic if you could do that for me.
6232923	eng	I wish Tom wouldn't go out after dark by himself.
6232924	eng	Tom doesn't know he'll never be able to do that again.
6232925	eng	I hope Tom isn't awake.
6232926	eng	It was your children who were causing the problem.
6232927	eng	I wish I hadn't tried to convince Tom to do that.
6232928	eng	Tom doesn't have the confidence to do that by himself.
6232929	eng	I hope Tom isn't alone.
6232930	eng	It was easier to do that than I expected it to be.
6232931	eng	I wish I hadn't suggested to Tom that he do that.
6232932	eng	Tom didn't think you were going to be able to do that.
6232933	eng	I hope Tom is unbiased.
6232934	eng	It started to rain as soon as we pitched the tent.
6232935	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me why he did that.
6232936	eng	Tom didn't start playing the mandolin until last year.
6232937	eng	I hope Tom is unafraid.
6232938	eng	It must be boring for you to do that all the time.
6232939	eng	I want to know why Tom didn't go to school today.
6232940	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he ought to do that.
6232941	eng	I hope Tom is truthful.
6232942	eng	It makes no difference whether you do that or not.
6232943	eng	I told Tom that I thought he should go on a diet.
6232944	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he shouldn't do that.
6232945	eng	I hope Tom is sensible.
6232946	eng	It began to rain as soon as we started doing that.
6232947	eng	I told Tom he had only thirty minutes to do that.
6232948	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he needed to do that.
6232949	eng	I hope Tom is punished.
6232950	eng	If you don't do that soon, you may not be able to.
6232951	eng	I told Tom I thought it would be safe to do that.
6232952	eng	Tom didn't realize he shouldn't have tried doing that.
6232953	eng	I hope Tom is punctual.
6232954	eng	If we hadn't done that, it would've been more fun.
6232955	eng	I told Tom I don't know any other way to do that.
6232956	eng	Tom didn't know you weren't supposed to do that today.
6232957	eng	I hope Tom is prepared.
6232958	eng	If it had been fine yesterday, I'd have done that.
6232959	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to be helping Tom.
6232960	eng	Tom didn't know if he would be able to do that or not.
6232961	eng	I hope Tom is obedient.
6232962	eng	If I refuse to fight, I'll be considered a coward.
6232963	eng	I thought you said you wanted to do that for Tom.
6232964	eng	Tom didn't know he was supposed to do that by himself.
6232965	eng	I hope Tom is mistaken.
6232967	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that for us.
6232968	eng	Tom did what he had to do, and I did what I had to do.
6232969	eng	I hope Tom is home now.
6232970	eng	I'm the only person in the office who can do that.
6232971	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that for me.
6232972	eng	Tom could possibly be lonely, but I don't think he is.
6232973	eng	I hope Tom is generous.
6232974	eng	I'm the only one here who doesn't have a computer.
6232975	eng	I thought Tom would be unenthusiastic about that.
6232976	eng	Tom confessed that he was the one who broke the glass.
6232977	eng	I hope Tom is doing OK.
6232978	eng	I'd like to talk to you in private before I leave.
6232979	eng	I thought Tom would be able to do that on Monday.
6232980	eng	Tom asked me several questions that I couldn't answer.
6232981	eng	I hope Tom can do that.
6232982	eng	I'd like to stay in Boston for another week or so.
6232983	eng	I thought Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
6232984	eng	Tom apparently lived in Boston when he was in college.
6232985	eng	I heard Tom doing that.
6232986	eng	I wouldn't do that even if you offered to help me.
6232987	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask us not to do that.
6232988	eng	Tom and his brother used to never get along very well.
6232989	eng	I enjoyed Tom's speech.
6232990	eng	I wish you wouldn't go out after dark by yourself.
6232991	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask me not to do that.
6232992	eng	Tom and his brother never used to get along very well.
6232993	eng	I didn't call Tom back.
6232994	eng	I wasn't planning to go to Boston until next week.
6232995	eng	I thought Tom said he didn't know how to do that.
6232996	eng	Tom and his brother didn't use to get along very well.
6232997	eng	I couldn't talk to Tom.
6232998	eng	I wasn't able to do that, but it was worth trying.
6232999	eng	I thought Tom might want to learn how to do that.
6233000	eng	Tom and I weren't able to do anything we wanted to do.
6233001	eng	I can't make Tom leave.
6233002	vie	Hôm nay bạn có vẻ rảnh nhỉ?
6233003	vie	Lính thì cũng là người.
6233004	vie	Làm việc quyết liệt nhưng cũng tìm cách thức nhẹ nhàng
6233005	vie	Tớ cần biết chuyện gì đã xảy ra với Tom.
6233006	vie	Tom đoán là Mary sẽ tới muộn.
6233007	vie	Anh ấy hay hỏi nhiều lắm.
6233008	vie	Cháu nó còn nhỏ, có khi quá nhỏ.
6233009	vie	Mình không thể nói tiếng Pháp tốt như mình muốn.
6233010	fra	L'amour est éternel tant qu'il dure.
6233011	vie	Mình vừa nhắc tới Fadil.
6233012	vie	Bỏ nó đi, bạn đâu còn là trẻ con nữa.
6233013	vie	Cái tượng này là của bọn họ.
6233014	vie	Không phải dễ để có sức khỏe tốt.
6233015	eng	Love is eternal as long as it lasts.
6233016	vie	Ồ xin lỗi, tớ có đánh thức ấy dậy không?
6233017	vie	Mình đang cố gắng mở rộng vốn từ.
6233018	vie	Kể cho tớ biết tất cả về cô ấy đi.
6233019	eng	I was so weak that I couldn't even pick up a book.
6233020	eng	I think you ought to ask Tom to buy that for you.
6233021	eng	Tom and I were the first ones to volunteer to do that.
6233022	eng	I can't make Tom do it.
6233023	eng	I want you to come visit us in Boston next summer.
6233024	eng	I think this is the first time Tom has done that.
6233025	eng	Tom and I went downtown to eat steak at Chuck's Diner.
6233026	eng	I can buy that for Tom.
6233027	eng	I want to know how much time you spent doing that.
6233028	eng	I think it might be dangerous for Tom to do that.
6233029	eng	Tom and I used to live in the same apartment building.
6233030	eng	I asked Tom to help us.
6233031	eng	I took what I thought was a shortcut and got lost.
6233032	eng	I think Tom won't be finished doing that by 2:30.
6233033	eng	Tom and I studied French together yesterday afternoon.
6233034	eng	How should Tom do that?
6233035	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to do that anymore.
6233036	eng	I think Tom won't be difficult to get along with.
6233037	eng	Tom and I didn't speak to each other for three months.
6233038	eng	Has Tom studied French?
6233039	eng	I thought you didn't know how to drive a forklift.
6233040	eng	I think Tom might get in trouble if he does that.
6233041	eng	Tom and I became friends when we both lived in Boston.
6233042	eng	Even Tom can't do that.
6233043	eng	I thought I'd be able to do that without any help.
6233044	eng	I think Tom may stay in Boston for another month.
6233045	eng	Tom's horse's front right leg looks like it's broken.
6233046	eng	Don't make Tom do that.
6233047	eng	I thought I wouldn't be able to do that by myself.
6233048	eng	I think Tom is the only one who wants to do that.
6233049	eng	Tom wouldn't have yelled at me if I hadn't been late.
6233050	eng	Did Tom study with you?
6233051	eng	I thought I probably shouldn't go there by myself.
6233052	eng	I think Tom is the only one who needs to do that.
6233053	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that that if he hadn't had to.
6233054	eng	You're a bit like Tom.
6233055	eng	I think we could do that without making any noise.
6233056	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to do that.
6233057	eng	Tom would've done that himself if he'd had known how.
6233058	eng	Will Tom do that, too?
6233059	eng	I think most people know that peanuts aren't nuts.
6233060	eng	I think Tom did that yesterday, but I'm not sure.
6233061	eng	Tom would be very disappointed if you didn't do that.
6233062	eng	Will Tom be all right?
6233063	eng	I think it might not be so interesting to do that.
6233064	eng	I think Tom could've done that without your help.
6233065	eng	Tom would be very disappointed if he saw you do that.
6233066	eng	Who did that with Tom?
6233067	eng	I think a punishment like that would be too harsh.
6233068	eng	I think Tom could've done that faster by himself.
6233069	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without some assistance.
6233070	eng	When's Tom's birthday?
6233071	eng	I suppose you've been told that many times before.
6233072	eng	I think Tom could do that if he really wanted to.
6233073	eng	Tom will probably tell his son to eat his vegetables.
6233074	eng	When will Tom do that?
6233075	eng	I should've been able to do that without any help.
6233076	eng	I think Tom could be the boss if he wanted to be.
6233077	eng	Tom will likely be up. He's usually up till midnight.
6233078	eng	When does Tom do that?
6233079	eng	I plan to live in Boston for at least three years.
6233080	eng	I think Tom could be finished doing that by 2:30.
6233081	eng	Tom was the only other person who could've done that.
6233082	eng	When did you call Tom?
6233083	eng	I know you don't want to do that, but you need to.
6233084	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I wanted to do that.
6233085	eng	Tom was the first one in our family to go to college.
6233086	eng	We saw Tom doing that.
6233087	eng	I know you don't want to do that, but you have to.
6233088	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I needed to do that.
6233089	eng	Tom took off his boots and put on a pair of slippers.
6233090	eng	We arrived before Tom.
6233091	eng	I know that doing this must seem dangerous to you.
6233092	eng	I shouldn't have borrowed so much money from Tom.
6233093	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't know what he needs to do.
6233094	eng	We all laughed at Tom.
6233095	eng	I just found out that you're going to be arrested.
6233096	eng	I should've waited until Tom got here to do that.
6233097	eng	Tom told me he doesn't know any other way to do that.
6233098	eng	Was Tom afraid of you?
6233099	eng	I hope you don't have to stay in Boston all month.
6233100	eng	I should've been able to do that better than Tom.
6233101	eng	Tom thinks that doing that would be a very good idea.
6233102	eng	Those are Tom's shoes.
6233103	eng	I helped myself to another serving of green beans.
6233104	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I want to do that.
6233105	eng	Tom still hasn't replaced the light bulb in his room.
6233106	eng	This bicycle is Tom's.
6233107	eng	I have neither the time nor the energy to do that.
6233108	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I need to do that.
6233109	eng	Tom soon realized he shouldn't have tried doing that.
6233110	eng	These books are Tom's.
6233111	eng	I don't yet know whether I need to do that or not.
6233112	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I have to do that.
6233113	eng	Tom should've sold his house while he had the chance.
6233114	eng	That will impress Tom.
6233115	eng	I don't yet know whether I have to do that or not.
6233116	eng	I should probably tell Tom what needs to be done.
6233117	eng	Tom should've been present at this morning's meeting.
6233118	eng	Probably Tom did that.
6233119	eng	I don't want to tell anybody about what I've done.
6233120	eng	I should probably tell Tom I won't do that again.
6233121	eng	Tom should've been downstairs waiting, but he wasn't.
6233122	eng	Perhaps Tom won't win.
6233123	eng	I don't want to spend the rest of my life in jail.
6233124	eng	I should probably not tell Tom what I have to do.
6233125	eng	Tom should've been able to do that without your help.
6233126	eng	Only Tom will do that.
6233127	eng	I don't want to sell my car, but I have no choice.
6233128	eng	I should probably not tell Tom to do that for me.
6233129	eng	Tom should seriously consider not doing that anymore.
6233130	eng	Let's ask Tom to help.
6233131	eng	I don't think that would be the right thing to do.
6233132	eng	I never had any intention of letting Tom do that.
6233133	eng	Tom should be able to do something as simple as that.
6233134	eng	Is Tom still studying?
6233135	eng	I don't think that doing that would be a bad idea.
6233136	eng	I know this won't be the last time Tom does that.
6233137	eng	Tom seems to have lost interest in collecting shells.
6233138	eng	Is Tom afraid of this?
6233139	eng	I don't think that doing that is such a good idea.
6233140	eng	I knew Tom would be confused by your explanation.
6233141	eng	Tom says he thinks it might be impossible to do that.
6233142	eng	Is Tom afraid of that?
6233143	eng	I don't think that doing that is a very good idea.
6233144	eng	I just found out that Tom isn't going to do that.
6233145	eng	Tom says he sells about thirty loaves of bread a day.
6233146	eng	Is Tom afraid of dogs?
6233147	eng	I don't think it would be a smart idea to do that.
6233148	eng	I hope Tom knows he has to do that before Monday.
6233149	eng	Tom says he has to find somebody to help him do that.
6233150	eng	I've seen Tom do that.
6233151	eng	I don't think I'll be finished doing that by 2:30.
6233152	eng	I forgot to remind Tom that he needed to do that.
6233153	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how to ski very well.
6233154	eng	I've missed Tom a lot.
6233155	eng	I don't think I have enough money to pay the bill.
6233156	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be punished.
6233157	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why the picnic was canceled.
6233158	eng	I'll help Tom do that.
6233159	eng	I don't remember whether the box was empty or not.
6233160	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be punctual.
6233161	eng	Tom says doesn't think he'll ever be able to do that.
6233162	eng	I'll do that with Tom.
6233163	eng	I don't plan to wait for more than thirty minutes.
6233164	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be prepared.
6233165	eng	Tom said we should wait until sunrise before we left.
6233166	eng	I'll buy that for Tom.
6233167	eng	I don't know why my boss wants me to go to Boston.
6233168	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be forgiven.
6233169	eng	Tom said we should wait until after sunrise to leave.
6233170	eng	I wonder if Tom is up.
6233171	eng	I don't know why my boss chose me to go to Boston.
6233172	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be arrested.
6233173	eng	Tom said wanted to do that, but he wasn't allowed to.
6233174	eng	I watched Tom do that.
6233175	eng	I don't know what happened because I wasn't there.
6233176	eng	I doubt that Tom will be arrested for doing that.
6233177	eng	Tom said they wouldn't permit him to do that anymore.
6233178	eng	I thought Tom was shy.
6233179	eng	I don't know how to write a love letter in French.
6233180	eng	I doubt if Tom will be troubled by what happened.
6233181	eng	Tom said that's not likely to happen if it's raining.
6233182	eng	I think Tom will late.
6233183	eng	I don't have any friends I can talk to about this.
6233184	eng	I doubt if Tom will be amused by what's going on.
6233185	eng	Tom said that was the first time he'd ever done that.
6233186	eng	I think Tom is stoned.
6233187	eng	I don't go to the movies as often as I would like.
6233188	eng	I don't want to bother Tom while he was studying.
6233189	eng	Tom said that he was going to leave tomorrow morning.
6233190	eng	I think Tom is stingy.
6233191	eng	I didn't want to sell my car, but I had no choice.
6233192	eng	I don't understand why Tom's supposed to do that.
6233193	eng	Tom said that he didn't dare express his own opinion.
6233194	eng	I think Tom is sleepy.
6233195	eng	I didn't want to look, but I couldn't help myself.
6233196	eng	I don't think Tom would mind buying that for you.
6233197	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't spanked his son so hard.
6233198	eng	I think Tom is single.
6233199	eng	I didn't think you'd be drunk so early in the day.
6233200	eng	I don't think Tom would ever consider doing that.
6233201	eng	Tom said he wasn't expecting to play in today's game.
6233202	eng	I think Tom is guilty.
6233203	eng	I didn't think you were in your office on Mondays.
6233204	eng	I don't think Tom would be opposed to doing that.
6233205	eng	Tom said he was trying to learn how to play the oboe.
6233206	eng	I think Tom is afraid.
6233207	eng	I didn't think that I wouldn't be able to do that.
6233208	eng	I don't think Tom would be glad if that happened.
6233209	eng	Tom said he was the only one who knew how to do that.
6233210	eng	I think Tom is absent.
6233211	eng	I didn't think it would be a good idea to do that.
6233212	eng	I don't think Tom will be through doing that yet.
6233213	eng	Tom said he was having a really hard time doing that.
6233214	eng	I think Tom does that.
6233215	eng	I didn't think I'd be finished doing that by 2:30.
6233216	eng	I don't think Tom loves me as much as I love him.
6233217	eng	Tom said he wanted to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6233218	eng	I should've paged Tom.
6233219	eng	I didn't think I would be the last one to do that.
6233220	eng	I don't think Tom knows how to do that very well.
6233221	eng	Tom said he used to go to Boston three times a month.
6233222	eng	I should wait for Tom.
6233223	eng	I didn't tell anyone where I'd hid the gold coins.
6233224	eng	I don't think Tom is going to be able to do that.
6233225	eng	Tom said he thought that would probably never happen.
6233226	eng	I need to be with Tom.
6233227	eng	I didn't start to study French until I was thirty.
6233228	eng	I don't think Tom is difficult to get along with.
6233229	eng	Tom said he thought it was a little risky to do that.
6233230	eng	I looked right at Tom.
6233231	eng	I didn't read the book my teacher told me to read.
6233232	eng	I don't think Tom could do that even if he tried.
6233233	eng	Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
6233234	eng	I looked at Tom again.
6233235	eng	I didn't learn to swim until I was in my thirties.
6233236	eng	I don't think I need Tom's permission to do that.
6233237	eng	Tom said he thought he might be permitted to do that.
6233238	eng	I know why Tom is sad.
6233239	eng	I didn't learn to speak French until I was thirty.
6233240	eng	I don't like the same kind of movies as Tom does.
6233241	eng	Tom said he thought doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
6233242	eng	I know that Tom is up.
6233243	eng	I didn't know you were going to be at the meeting.
6233244	eng	I don't like the same kind of food that Tom does.
6233245	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be required to do that.
6233246	eng	I know that Tom is OK.
6233247	eng	I didn't know what made my leg swell up like that.
6233248	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't want me to help him.
6233249	eng	Tom said he knew he might need to do that by himself.
6233250	eng	I know Tom's children.
6233251	eng	I didn't know that you had to do that by yourself.
6233252	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't come to school today.
6233253	eng	Tom said he knew he might have to do that by himself.
6233254	eng	I know Tom lied to me.
6233255	eng	I didn't know that what we were doing was illegal.
6233256	eng	I don't know who Tom plans to go to the zoo with.
6233257	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that without some help.
6233258	eng	I know Tom isn't here.
6233259	eng	I didn't know that the police were looking for me.
6233260	eng	I don't know who Tom is planning to do that with.
6233261	eng	Tom said he didn't really feel like doing that today.
6233262	eng	I know Tom is teasing.
6233263	eng	I didn't know that I didn't have to do that today.
6233264	eng	I don't know whether Tom will agree to go or not.
6233265	eng	Tom said he couldn't go camping with us next weekend.
6233266	eng	I hope Tom isn't slow.
6233268	eng	I don't know whether Tom wants to do that or not.
6233269	eng	Tom said doing that was easier than he expected.
6233270	eng	I hope Tom isn't lost.
6233271	eng	I didn't know I was supposed to do that by myself.
6233272	eng	I don't know whether Tom needs to do that or not.
6233273	eng	Tom said doing that cost more money than he expected.
6233274	eng	I hope Tom isn't late.
6233275	eng	I didn't have enough time to do that this morning.
6233276	eng	I don't know whether Tom is good at chess or not.
6233277	eng	Tom said I shouldn't have tried doing that by myself.
6233278	eng	I hope Tom isn't here.
6233279	eng	I didn't have any money and couldn't buy any food.
6233280	eng	I don't know where Tom spent his summer vacation.
6233281	eng	Tom probably shouldn't do that while it's still dark.
6233282	eng	I hope Tom isn't cold.
6233283	eng	I didn't do anything that I wasn't supposed to do.
6233284	eng	I don't know how Tom will get to school tomorrow.
6233285	eng	Tom probably just didn't know what needed to be done.
6233286	eng	I hope Tom is sincere.
6233287	eng	I did that as soon as I felt it was safe to do so.
6233288	eng	I don't know for certain who Tom's girlfriend is.
6233289	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know he's going to be fired.
6233290	eng	I hope Tom is prudent.
6233291	eng	I could probably do that in less than three hours.
6233292	eng	I didn't wake Tom up at 6:30 like he asked me to.
6233293	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why you want me to do that.
6233294	eng	I hope Tom is present.
6233295	eng	I can't remember who I'm supposed to give this to.
6233296	eng	I didn't think that Tom would be able to do that.
6233297	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I hardly ever do that.
6233298	eng	I hope Tom is pleased.
6233299	eng	I can't remember whether or not I locked the door.
6233300	eng	I didn't think Tom would go to Boston by himself.
6233301	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I don't often do that.
6233302	eng	I hope Tom is jealous.
6233303	eng	How much time do you think you'll need to do that?
6233304	eng	I didn't think Tom would eat what I made for him.
6233305	eng	Tom probably doesn't know much about classical music.
6233306	eng	I hope Tom is excited.
6233307	eng	How much time do you think you'll have to do that?
6233308	eng	I didn't think Tom would be reluctant to do that.
6233309	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to eat with chopsticks.
6233310	eng	I hope Tom is curious.
6233311	eng	How much time do you estimate you need to do that?
6233312	eng	I didn't think Tom would be motivated to do that.
6233313	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he shouldn't do that again.
6233314	eng	I helped Tom stand up.
6233315	eng	How much money do you think I should take with me?
6233316	eng	I didn't think Tom would be desperate to do that.
6233317	eng	Tom looked better today than the last time I saw him.
6233318	eng	I helped Tom clean up.
6233319	eng	How many years do you think it'll take to do that?
6233320	eng	I didn't think Tom would be confused, but he was.
6233321	eng	Tom listed a lot of reasons why we shouldn't do that.
6233322	eng	I have a gift for Tom.
6233323	eng	How many weeks do you think it'll take to do that?
6233324	eng	I didn't think Tom knew how to cook Mexican food.
6233325	eng	Tom knew he might be permitted to do that by himself.
6233326	eng	I didn't tell Tom why.
6233327	eng	How many times have you been absent this semester?
6233328	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I went to Boston last week.
6233329	eng	Tom isn't likely to be the first one to do that.
6233330	eng	I didn't speak to Tom.
6233331	eng	How many seconds does it actually take to do that?
6233332	eng	I didn't really feel like playing chess with Tom.
6233333	eng	Tom isn't likely to be interested in doing that.
6233334	eng	I bought that for Tom.
6233335	eng	How many months have you already spent doing that?
6233336	eng	I didn't really expect Tom to answer my question.
6233337	eng	Tom is the only person in the office who can do that.
6233338	eng	How long was Tom sick?
6233339	eng	How many minutes does it actually take to do that?
6233340	eng	I didn't realize that Tom didn't want to do that.
6233341	eng	Tom is the only one who wants to go home early today.
6233342	eng	How is Tom doing that?
6233343	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take to do that?
6233344	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom didn't show up.
6233345	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to know how to do that.
6233346	eng	Has Tom taught French?
6233347	eng	Even though you don't have to do that, you should.
6233348	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to quit his job.
6233349	eng	Tom is obviously never going to learn how to do that.
6233350	eng	Even Tom spoke French.
6233351	eng	Don't you think it would be ridiculous to do that?
6233352	eng	I didn't know how to do that until Tom taught me.
6233353	eng	Tom is likely to be glad that that's going to happen.
6233354	eng	Does Tom teach French?
6233355	eng	Don't you think it would be impossible to do that?
6233356	eng	I didn't know how much more money Tom would need.
6233357	eng	Tom hasn't lived in Boston as long as he says he has.
6233358	eng	Does Tom study French?
6233359	eng	Don't you think it would be depressing to do that?
6233360	eng	I didn't know Tom was so good at speaking French.
6233361	eng	Tom has wanted to study French since he was thirteen.
6233362	eng	Does Tom go to school?
6233363	eng	Don't forget to turn off the stove when you leave.
6233364	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to be at the meeting.
6233365	eng	Tom has three friends who are professional musicians.
6233366	eng	Did you let Tom drive?
6233367	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary that she has to do that.
6233368	eng	I didn't buy everything that Tom asked me to buy.
6233369	eng	Tom has permitted his children to do that many times.
6233370	eng	Will Tom come by bus?
6233371	eng	Doing that wasn't as fun as I thought it would be.
6233372	eng	I could've gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't.
6233373	eng	Tom has forged his father's signature more than once.
6233374	eng	Why isn't Tom afraid?
6233375	eng	Do you think you'll feel like doing that tomorrow?
6233376	eng	I can't speak French as well as Tom thinks I can.
6233377	eng	Tom has finally done what he said he was going to do.
6233378	eng	Why is Tom so sleepy?
6233379	eng	Do you think you can do that without getting hurt?
6233380	eng	I can't remember what Tom told me I needed to do.
6233381	eng	Tom has enough time to do that if he really wants to.
6233382	eng	Why is Tom so hungry?
6233383	eng	Do you still have a copy of yesterday's newspaper?
6233384	eng	I can't believe Tom would really want to do that.
6233385	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what we need to do.
6233386	eng	What made Tom afraid?
6233387	eng	Do you really think it would be unsafe to do that?
6233388	eng	How many more months will it take Tom to do that?
6233389	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what we have to do.
6233390	eng	Those are Tom's cats.
6233391	eng	Do you really think it would be tiring to do that?
6233392	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will do that?
6233393	eng	Tom has been trying hard to do what needs to be done.
6233394	eng	This hat isn't Tom's.
6233395	eng	Do you really think it would be stupid to do that?
6233396	eng	How many months has Tom already spent doing that?
6233397	eng	Tom has been playing the French horn for three years.
6233398	eng	This dog isn't Tom's.
6233399	eng	Do you really think doing that would be unethical?
6233400	eng	How do you know Tom won't be in Boston next week?
6233401	eng	Tom has been caught cheating on tests more than once.
6233402	eng	These pens are Tom's.
6233403	eng	Do you really think doing that would be enjoyable?
6233404	eng	How do you know Tom wasn't going to be in Boston?
6233405	eng	Tom had no idea that the police were looking for him.
6233406	eng	These are Tom's cats.
6233407	eng	Do you really think doing that would be dangerous?
6233408	eng	Don't you want to know why I bought that for Tom?
6233409	eng	Tom gradually began to understand what was happening.
6233410	eng	Tell Tom to be quiet.
6233411	eng	Do you know any other way we could try doing that?
6233412	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be faster.
6233413	eng	Tom got into a lot of trouble when he was a teenager.
6233414	eng	Tell Tom I won't eat.
6233415	eng	Do you have any idea who'd do something like this?
6233416	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be easier.
6233417	eng	Tom gets up early every morning and goes out jogging.
6233418	eng	Perhaps Tom did that.
6233419	eng	Didn't you know we weren't going to do that today?
6233420	eng	Doing that the way Tom suggested would be better.
6233421	eng	Tom folded his shirts and put them into his suitcase.
6233422	eng	Only Tom can do that.
6233423	eng	Didn't you know I didn't know how to speak French?
6233425	eng	Tom finally realized that he shouldn't be doing that.
6233426	eng	My dog bit Tom's leg.
6233427	eng	Didn't I tell you that you didn't need to do that?
6233428	eng	Do you think Tom is the only one who can do that?
6233429	eng	Tom explained why it would be a good idea to do that.
6233430	eng	Maybe Tom is at home.
6233431	eng	Didn't I tell you that you didn't have to do that?
6233432	eng	Do you really want to be here when Tom gets here?
6233433	eng	Tom doesn't think that the judge's decision was fair.
6233434	eng	Is Tom still in jail?
6233435	eng	Didn't I tell you not to worry about that anymore?
6233436	eng	Didn't you know that Tom would be here this week?
6233437	eng	Tom doesn't think it would be a good idea to do that.
6233438	eng	Is Tom really asleep?
6233439	eng	Did you know you were going to be able to do that?
6233440	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
6233441	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he should do that.
6233443	eng	Did you know there's more than one way to do this?
6233444	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was planning to do that?
6233445	eng	Tom doesn't seem to understand why he has to do that.
6233447	eng	As I told you before, I don't know how to do that.
6233448	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was in Boston last year?
6233449	eng	Tom doesn't seem to have the guts to do that anymore.
6233450	eng	I think Tom is weird.
6233451	eng	Am I the only one who doesn't know how to do that?
6233452	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was in Boston last week?
6233453	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be doing what we asked him to do.
6233454	eng	I think Tom is upset.
6233455	eng	"Why didn't you do that?" "Because I had a fever."
6233456	eng	Didn't you know Tom when you were in high school?
6233457	eng	Tom doesn't like living in Boston and I don't either.
6233458	eng	I think Tom is tired.
6233459	epo	La amo estas eterna kiel longe ĝi daŭras.
6233460	eng	You're the only one who'll be allowed to do that.
6233461	eng	Didn't you know Tom was interested in modern art?
6233462	eng	Tom doesn't know how much time he'll need to do that.
6233463	eng	I think Tom is tipsy.
6233464	eng	You're the only one who seems to know what to do.
6233465	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to be a studio musician?
6233466	eng	Tom doesn't know how much time he'll have to do that.
6233467	eng	I think Tom is tense.
6233468	eng	You're the only one who knows what we need to do.
6233469	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't have to be here today?
6233470	eng	Tom didn't tell me that the picnic has been canceled.
6233471	eng	I think Tom is sorry.
6233472	eng	You're the only one who knows what we have to do.
6233473	eng	Did you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
6233474	eng	Tom didn't tell me his parents were getting divorced.
6233475	eng	I think Tom is pushy.
6233476	eng	You're the only one who doesn't seem to be happy.
6233477	eng	Did you know that Tom wasn't paid for doing that?
6233478	eng	Tom didn't seem to be the one most likely to do that.
6233479	eng	I think Tom is broke.
6233480	eng	You're the only one who doesn't have an umbrella.
6233481	eng	Did you know that Tom was going to be here today?
6233482	eng	Tom didn't know we weren't supposed to do that today.
6233483	eng	I think Tom is bored.
6233484	eng	You're not the only one who didn't pass the test.
6233485	eng	Did you know that Tom has a house on Park Street?
6233486	eng	Tom didn't know that you wouldn't be able to do that.
6233487	eng	I think Tom is blind.
6233488	eng	You're likely the only person who has to do that.
6233489	eng	Did you know that Tom had a house on Park Street?
6233490	eng	Tom didn't know that the police were looking for him.
6233491	eng	I think Tom is alone.
6233492	eng	You'll eventually be able to do that on your own.
6233493	eng	Did you know that Tom almost never swims anymore?
6233494	eng	Tom didn't know that he didn't have to do that today.
6233495	eng	I should've paid Tom.
6233496	eng	You'd never forgive us if we did that, would you?
6233497	eng	Did you know Tom was still a high school student?
6233498	eng	Tom didn't have the confidence to do that by himself.
6233499	eng	I should go with Tom.
6233500	eng	You'd better get out of here while you still can.
6233501	eng	Did you know Tom was going to be able to do that?
6233502	eng	Tom didn't come home last night until after midnight.
6233503	eng	I should go help Tom.
6233504	eng	You'd be able to do that if you really wanted to.
6233505	eng	Did you know Tom is also a pretty good guitarist?
6233506	eng	Tom definitely won't do that in this kind of weather.
6233507	eng	I saw Tom doing that.
6233508	eng	You worked in Boston for a few years, didn't you?
6233509	eng	Did Tom agree to stay in Boston for another week?
6233510	eng	Tom brushes his daughter's hair almost every morning.
6233511	eng	I never did love Tom.
6233512	eng	You won't be allowed to do that without a permit.
6233513	eng	All three of Tom's brothers are going to do that.
6233514	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't show up for work yesterday.
6233515	eng	I looked back at Tom.
6233516	eng	You were the last person to do that, weren't you?
6233517	eng	You're the one who did that for Tom, aren't you?
6233518	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't show up for my appointment.
6233519	eng	I know Tom's brother.
6233520	eng	You were able to do that better than we expected.
6233521	eng	You'll help Tom do that after supper, won't you?
6233522	eng	Tom and three other prisoners are on a hunger strike.
6233523	eng	I knew Tom's brother.
6233524	eng	You thought I was through doing that, didn't you?
6233525	eng	You'd do that if Tom asked you to, wouldn't you?
6233526	eng	Tom and I'll be on vacation for the next three weeks.
6233527	eng	I hope Tom isn't shy.
6233528	eng	You thought I didn't need to do that, didn't you?
6233529	eng	You wouldn't like it if Tom did that, would you?
6233530	eng	Tom and I were the ones who were supposed to do that.
6233531	eng	I hope Tom isn't mad.
6233532	eng	You thought I didn't have to do that, didn't you?
6233533	eng	You won't permit Tom to do that again, will you?
6233534	eng	Tom and I were drinking coffee together on the porch.
6233535	eng	I hope Tom is unhurt.
6233536	eng	You think I'm still afraid to do that, don't you?
6233537	eng	You won't be able to talk Tom out of doing that.
6233538	eng	Tom and I were both in the hospital at the same time.
6233539	eng	I hope Tom is scared.
6233540	eng	You still haven't been able to do that, have you?
6233541	eng	You warned Tom not to do that again, didn't you?
6233542	eng	Tom and I haven't seen each other since grade school.
6233543	eng	I haven't called Tom.
6233544	eng	You still do that as often as you can, don't you?
6233545	eng	You thought it was Tom who did that, didn't you?
6233546	eng	Tom and I have never met, but I know a lot about him.
6233547	eng	I had to talk to Tom.
6233548	eng	You shouldn't have waited until today to do that.
6233549	eng	You thought Tom did that on purpose, didn't you?
6233550	eng	Tom and I have been working together for three years.
6233551	eng	I got into Tom's car.
6233552	eng	You seem to be the only one who wants to do that.
6233553	eng	You think Tom will be at the meeting, don't you?
6233554	eng	Tom and I aren't likely to ever see each other again.
6233555	eng	I got drunk with Tom.
6233556	eng	You never had an opportunity to do that, did you?
6233557	eng	You think I could get Tom to do that, don't you?
6233558	eng	Tom and I are planning to move to Boston next spring.
6233559	eng	I got Tom to help me.
6233560	eng	You know why I didn't want to do that, don't you?
6233561	eng	You still have no idea why Tom did that, do you?
6233562	eng	Tom and I are going to play badminton this afternoon.
6233563	eng	I got Tom to do that.
6233564	eng	You know they won't permit you to do that, right?
6233565	eng	You should've told Tom why he needed to do that.
6233566	eng	Tom almost froze to death when he fell into the lake.
6233567	eng	I disagreed with Tom.
6233568	eng	You know there's no way I can do that, don't you?
6233569	eng	You should've done that the way Tom told you to.
6233570	eng	Tom admitted he wasn't the one who actually did that.
6233571	eng	I caught up with Tom.
6233572	eng	You know that I don't want to do that, don't you?
6233573	eng	You should tell Tom you don't intend to do that.
6233574	eng	Tom admitted he wasn't actually the one who did that.
6233575	eng	I arrived before Tom.
6233577	eng	You should probably tell Tom to stop doing that.
6233578	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what he was supposed to do.
6233579	eng	Has Tom left already?
6233580	eng	You know that I don't have to do that, don't you?
6233581	eng	You should probably tell Tom to do that for you.
6233582	eng	Tom's skull was crushed when the building collapsed.
6233583	eng	Has Tom forgiven you?
6233584	eng	You knew that I'd be able to do that, didn't you?
6233585	eng	You seemed to want to do that more than Tom did.
6233586	eng	Tom's first computer was given to him by his father.
6233587	eng	Even Tom can do that.
6233588	eng	You knew I'd do that sooner or later, didn't you?
6233589	eng	You seemed convinced that Tom wanted to do that.
6233590	eng	Tom would be able to do that if he really wanted to.
6233591	eng	Did you do that, Tom?
6233592	eng	You knew I wouldn't agree to do that, didn't you?
6233593	eng	You seemed convinced that Tom needed to do that.
6233594	eng	Tom won't be able to do what you've asked him to do.
6233595	eng	Did Tom speak French?
6233596	eng	You don't think I really need to do that, do you?
6233597	eng	You need to keep Tom from ever doing that again.
6233598	eng	Tom will probably be retired by this time next year.
6233599	eng	Did Tom buy anything?
6233600	eng	You don't seem to know what you're talking about.
6233601	eng	You learned how to do that from Tom, didn't you?
6233602	eng	Tom will probably be ready by the time we get there.
6233603	eng	Can Tom teach French?
6233604	eng	You don't really think I want to do that, do you?
6233605	eng	You know Tom can't do that very well, don't you?
6233606	eng	Tom will probably be drunk by the time we get there.
6233607	eng	All Tom does is read.
6233608	eng	You don't really think I need to do that, do you?
6233609	eng	You knew that Tom wanted to do that, didn't you?
6233610	eng	Tom will likely be finished doing that before lunch.
6233611	eng	You've made Tom cry.
6233612	eng	You don't really think I have to do that, do you?
6233613	eng	You have to keep Tom from ever doing that again.
6233614	eng	Tom will likely be curious why you chose to do that.
6233615	eng	Will Tom leave soon?
6233616	eng	You don't need to read this if you don't want to.
6233617	eng	You forgot to remind Tom to do that, didn't you?
6233618	eng	Tom will likely be curious to know how you did that.
6233619	eng	Why is Tom so tired?
6233620	eng	You don't care whether we do that or not, do you?
6233621	eng	You don't want to know why Tom did that, do you?
6233622	eng	Tom was the only other person who wanted to do that.
6233623	eng	Was Tom afraid, too?
6233624	eng	You didn't really think I would do that, did you?
6233625	eng	You don't want Tom to do that right now, do you?
6233626	eng	Tom was the only other person who needed to do that.
6233627	eng	Those belong to Tom.
6233628	eng	You didn't really think I could do that, did you?
6233629	eng	You don't think that Tom should do that, do you?
6233630	eng	Tom was the first one who said he'd like to do that.
6233631	eng	These belong to Tom.
6233632	eng	You didn't know that I couldn't do that, did you?
6233633	eng	You don't think Tom will really do that, do you?
6233634	eng	Tom was the first one who said he wanted to do that.
6233635	eng	That made Tom laugh.
6233636	eng	You didn't have to do that if you didn't want to.
6233637	eng	You don't think Tom will likely do that, do you?
6233638	eng	Tom was in the garden planting flowers this morning.
6233639	eng	That belongs to Tom.
6233640	eng	You didn't expect to be able to do that, did you?
6233641	eng	You don't think Tom did that on purpose, do you?
6233642	eng	Tom wants to get back to Boston as soon as possible.
6233643	eng	Tell Tom to do that.
6233644	eng	You didn't expect me to do that for you, did you?
6233645	eng	You don't really care how Tom does that, do you?
6233646	eng	Tom turned on his flashlight and went into the cave.
6233647	eng	My opponent was Tom.
6233648	eng	You didn't actually do that by yourself, did you?
6233649	eng	You don't know why Tom needs to do that, do you?
6233650	eng	Tom told the police that three men had attacked him.
6233651	eng	My dog attacked Tom.
6233652	eng	You and I are both supposed to be there tomorrow.
6233653	eng	You didn't want to tell Tom to do that, did you?
6233654	eng	Tom told the police that his wallet had been stolen.
6233655	eng	Maybe Tom is sleepy.
6233656	eng	Yesterday, I worked in the garden in the morning.
6233657	eng	You didn't want Tom to help me do that, did you?
6233658	eng	Tom told me that to be gone by the time he got here.
6233659	eng	Maybe Tom is hungry.
6233660	eng	Wouldn't it be better if you didn't do that here?
6233661	eng	You didn't tell Tom I wouldn't do that, did you?
6233662	eng	Tom told me that he's able to speak three languages.
6233663	eng	Is Tom still afraid?
6233664	eng	Why do you think I'd be interested in doing that?
6233665	eng	You didn't need to tell Tom to do that, did you?
6233666	eng	Tom told me that he was amused by what was going on.
6233667	eng	I'd do that for Tom.
6233668	eng	Why can't we stay in Boston for a few more weeks?
6233669	eng	You didn't know why Tom had to do that, did you?
6233670	eng	Tom told me that I shouldn't always be so sarcastic.
6233671	eng	I tried to kiss Tom.
6233672	eng	Who was that who was riding in the taxi with you?
6233673	eng	You didn't know that Tom could do that, did you?
6233674	eng	Tom told me that I needed to attend today's meeting.
6233675	eng	I think Tom is well.
6233676	eng	When you go to Boston, where do you plan to stay?
6233677	eng	You didn't have to tell Tom to do that, did you?
6233678	eng	Tom thought he might not need to do that by himself.
6233679	eng	I think Tom is sure.
6233680	eng	We've already had several discussions about that.
6233681	eng	You asked Tom why he had to do that, didn't you?
6233682	eng	Tom thought he might not have to do that by himself.
6233683	eng	I think Tom is slow.
6233684	eng	We worked for three hours and never took a break.
6233685	eng	You asked Tom to do that by himself, didn't you?
6233686	eng	Tom thinks that doing that would be a very bad idea.
6233687	eng	I think Tom is nuts.
6233688	eng	We don't usually get much snow this time of year.
6233689	eng	You and I are the only people Tom ever talks to.
6233690	eng	Tom thinks some of his friends will want to do that.
6233691	eng	I think Tom is nosy.
6233692	eng	We don't need to pay this bill until next Monday.
6233693	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you can do that?
6233694	eng	Tom suggested we do that while we're here in Boston.
6233695	eng	I think Tom is next.
6233696	eng	We could go to Boston with you if you want us to.
6233697	eng	We'll go by bus unless Tom wants to take a taxi.
6233698	eng	Tom still comes to Boston two or three times a year.
6233699	eng	I think Tom is lost.
6233700	eng	There's absolutely no chance that that'll happen.
6233701	eng	We have to cross a bridge to get to Tom's house.
6233702	eng	Tom spends most of his free time playing the guitar.
6233703	eng	I think Tom is home.
6233704	eng	There's a church across the street from my house.
6233705	eng	We expect Tom to be back in Boston with us soon.
6233706	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that without our permission.
6233707	eng	I think Tom is high.
6233708	eng	There'll come a day when you'll enjoy doing that.
6233709	eng	Was Tom really able to do that without any help?
6233710	eng	Tom should've learned French when he had the chance.
6233711	eng	I think Tom is full.
6233712	eng	There are several reasons why you should do that.
6233713	eng	There's no way Tom would do something like that.
6233714	eng	Tom should've been finished doing that by yesterday.
6233715	eng	I think Tom is free.
6233716	eng	The only thing I ate yesterday was half an apple.
6233717	eng	There's no way Tom will ever do that by himself.
6233718	eng	Tom should've been able to do that without any help.
6233719	eng	I think Tom is fast.
6233720	eng	The man running down the street seemed terrified.
6233721	eng	There's a good chance that Tom missed the train.
6233722	eng	Tom seems to still be having a hard time doing that.
6233723	eng	I think Tom is evil.
6233724	eng	The house I grew up in didn't have running water.
6233725	eng	The school Tom goes to isn't far from his house.
6233726	eng	Tom says he's learned a lot in the last three years.
6233727	eng	I think Tom is done.
6233728	eng	Please don't forget to sign the application form.
6233729	eng	The only one here who's eager to do that is Tom.
6233730	eng	Tom says he's been living in Boston for three years.
6233731	eng	I think Tom is deaf.
6233732	eng	My wife and I both want to go to Boston with you.
6233733	eng	The first time Tom did that was three years ago.
6233734	eng	Tom says he would've done that if we'd asked him to.
6233735	eng	I think Tom is cool.
6233736	eng	My parents own a small restaurant on Park Street.
6233737	eng	That was the first time Tom ever went to Boston.
6233738	eng	Tom says he wants to give you the chance to do that.
6233739	eng	I think Tom is cold.
6233740	eng	My mother and I were in the garden all afternoon.
6233741	eng	That was the first time I'd ever seen Tom dance.
6233742	eng	Tom says he thought he can do that without any help.
6233743	eng	I think Tom is calm.
6233744	eng	My grandfather still uses a camera that uses film.
6233745	eng	Please tell Tom that he doesn't need to do that.
6233746	eng	Tom says he thinks it might not be smart to do that.
6233747	eng	I think Tom is bald.
6233748	eng	My boss is a Canadian man about thirty years old.
6233749	eng	Please tell Tom that he doesn't have to do that.
6233750	eng	Tom says he thinks it might be expensive to do that.
6233751	eng	I never forgave Tom.
6233752	eng	Most people don't like to do that when it's cold.
6233753	eng	Please tell Tom not to do that until after 2:30.
6233754	eng	Tom says he thinks it might be dangerous to do that.
6233755	eng	I know you trust Tom.
6233756	eng	Men and women don't usually do that the same way.
6233757	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to do that before 2:30.
6233758	eng	Tom says he thinks he can do that without your help.
6233759	eng	I know Tom's father.
6233760	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be wise to do that by yourself.
6233761	eng	Maybe Tom will stay in Boston for a month or so.
6233762	eng	Tom says he has to find somebody to do that for him.
6233763	eng	I know Tom is wrong.
6233764	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be safe to do that by yourself.
6233765	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know there's still work to do.
6233766	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can do that by himself.
6233767	eng	I know Tom is lying.
6233768	eng	Maybe it wouldn't be easy to do that by yourself.
6233769	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's supposed to do that.
6233770	eng	Tom says he doesn't care whether we help him or not.
6233771	eng	I knew Tom did that.
6233772	eng	Let's stop speaking French and switch to English.
6233773	eng	It'll probably be impossible for Tom to do that.
6233774	eng	Tom says he and his friends were just there to help.
6233775	eng	I hope Tom is tough.
6233776	eng	Let's not pitch the tent right next to the river.
6233777	eng	It would be disappointing if Tom didn't do that.
6233778	eng	Tom says everything's back to the way it used to be.
6233779	eng	I hope Tom is tired.
6233780	eng	It's been a lot of fun hanging out with you guys.
6233781	eng	Is Tom the only one who doesn't want to do that?
6233782	eng	Tom says doesn't have the time to do that right now.
6233783	eng	I hope Tom is ready.
6233784	eng	It'll probably be interesting for you to do that.
6233785	eng	Is Tom the only one who doesn't need to do that?
6233786	eng	Tom said there might just be one piece of cake left.
6233787	eng	I hope Tom is early.
6233788	eng	It would probably be wise to do that by yourself.
6233789	eng	Is Tom the only one who doesn't have to do that?
6233790	eng	Tom said that the two of us should do that together.
6233791	eng	I hope Tom is awake.
6233792	eng	It would probably be safe to do that by yourself.
6233793	eng	If I were in Tom's shoes, I'd refuse to do that.
6233794	eng	Tom said that he didn't really feel like doing that.
6233795	eng	I hope Tom is alone.
6233796	eng	It would probably be easy to do that by yourself.
6233797	eng	I've given up trying to persuade Tom to do that.
6233798	eng	Tom said his father told him never to do that again.
6233799	eng	I hope Tom is alive.
6233800	eng	It would probably be cheaper to do that yourself.
6233801	eng	I've given up trying to convince Tom to do that.
6233802	eng	Tom said he's the one responsible for what happened.
6233803	eng	I helped rescue Tom.
6233804	eng	It took me a more time than usual to fall asleep.
6233805	eng	I've finally managed to persuade Tom to do that.
6233806	eng	Tom said he's learned a lot in the last three years.
6233807	eng	I didn't poison Tom.
6233808	eng	If you're not busy, let's do that this afternoon.
6233809	eng	I'm the only one who ever really understood Tom.
6233810	eng	Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
6233811	eng	I didn't notice Tom.
6233812	eng	I've spent three times as much money as you have.
6233813	eng	I'm sure Tom would be happy to buy that for you.
6233814	eng	Tom said he wished you wouldn't do that by yourself.
6233815	eng	I did that, not Tom.
6233816	eng	I'll die if I don't take this medicine every day.
6233817	eng	I'm sure Tom will be finished doing that by now.
6233818	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't left the door unlocked.
6233819	eng	I did that with Tom.
6233821	eng	I'm quite sure that Tom won't forget to do that.
6233822	eng	Tom said he wanted me to talk you out of doing that.
6233823	eng	Doesn't Tom do that?
6233824	eng	I'd be very grateful if you would do that for me.
6233825	eng	I'll never believe that Tom did that on purpose.
6233826	eng	Tom said he thought it would be possible to do that.
6233827	eng	Didn't you know Tom?
6233828	eng	I'd be very disappointed if I saw you doing that.
6233829	eng	I won't waste my time trying to convince to Tom.
6233830	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to help us do that.
6233831	eng	All Tom does is eat.
6233832	eng	I would've stayed in Boston longer if I could've.
6233833	eng	I wish Tom would stay in Boston until Christmas.
6233834	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that by 2:30.
6233835	eng	Only Tom can do it.
6233836	eng	I wish I had more time to spend with my children.
6233837	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom about what we had done.
6233838	eng	Tom said he thought he might be required to do that.
6233839	eng	Maybe Tom is tired.
6233840	eng	I wish I could remember where I buried the money.
6233841	eng	I wish I hadn't parked my car next to Tom's car.
6233842	eng	Tom said he thought doing that wouldn't be much fun.
6233843	eng	Maybe Tom did that.
6233844	eng	I wasn't surprised that I wasn't able to do that.
6233845	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he should do that.
6233846	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be a good idea.
6233847	eng	I want to stop Tom.
6233848	eng	I wasn't surprised that I didn't need to do that.
6233849	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom he had to do that.
6233850	eng	Tom said he knew he might not have to do that again.
6233851	eng	I think Tom is out.
6233852	eng	I wasn't surprised that I didn't have to do that.
6233853	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me what he'd done.
6233854	eng	Tom said he knew he might not be allowed to do that.
6233855	eng	I think Tom is odd.
6233856	eng	I wasn't really hungry, so I didn't eat anything.
6233857	eng	I was surprised that Tom wasn't able to do that.
6233858	eng	Tom said he knew he might need to do that on Monday.
6233859	eng	I think Tom is mad.
6233860	eng	I wasn't able to speak French until I was thirty.
6233861	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do that.
6233862	eng	Tom said he knew he might have to do that on Monday.
6233863	eng	I think Tom is hot.
6233864	eng	I wasn't able to do everything I'd planned to do.
6233865	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't need to do that.
6233866	eng	Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
6233867	eng	I should thank Tom.
6233868	eng	I was very fortunate to have a chance to do that.
6233869	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't have to do that.
6233870	eng	Tom said he didn't want to spend all day doing that.
6233871	eng	I never called Tom.
6233872	eng	I wanted to visit Boston last year, but couldn't.
6233873	eng	I was lying to Tom when I said I didn't do that.
6233874	eng	Tom said he didn't remember where he'd put his keys.
6233875	eng	I missed Tom a lot.
6233876	eng	I want to know who you plan to go to Boston with.
6233877	eng	I told Tom that I thought I was losing my sight.
6233878	eng	Tom said doing that took more time than he expected.
6233879	por	O amor é eterno enquanto dura.
6233880	eng	I know Tom is rich.
6233881	eng	I want to know how long you plan to be in Boston.
6233882	eng	I told Tom I thought it would be fun to do that.
6233883	eng	Tom really needs to work on improving his technique.
6233884	eng	I know Tom is away.
6233885	eng	I thought you said you've seen people doing that.
6233886	eng	I thought you said you'd never do that with Tom.
6233887	eng	Tom realized later that he shouldn't have done that.
6233888	eng	I hope Tom is home.
6233889	eng	I thought you said you were motivated to do that.
6233890	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that with us.
6233891	eng	Tom probably won't do that again until next October.
6233892	eng	I hope Tom is here.
6233893	eng	I thought you said you were asked not to do that.
6233894	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that with me.
6233895	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I've never done that.
6233896	eng	I hope Tom is fine.
6233897	eng	I thought you said you had been asked to do that.
6233898	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy camping by himself.
6233899	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much money was stolen.
6233900	eng	I hope Tom is fair.
6233901	eng	I think there's a chance that it'll rain tonight.
6233902	eng	I thought Tom would have all the time he needed.
6233903	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how he's going to do that.
6233904	eng	I hope Tom is done.
6233905	eng	I think I'll know what to do when the time comes.
6233906	eng	I thought Tom would be the first one to do that.
6233907	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's got to do that today.
6233908	eng	I helped Tom do it.
6233909	eng	I think I'll be able to do that without any help.
6233910	eng	I thought Tom would be interested in doing that.
6233911	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's going to be punished.
6233912	eng	Does Tom sing well?
6233913	eng	I still haven't learned how to do that correctly.
6233914	eng	I thought Tom wasn't present at today's meeting.
6233915	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's going to be arrested.
6233916	eng	Ask Tom to do that.
6233917	eng	I should've studied French when I had the chance.
6233918	eng	I thought Tom might not be permitted to do that.
6233919	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he shouldn't do that here.
6233920	eng	Who's helping Tom?
6233921	eng	I seldom stay in Boston for more than three days.
6233922	eng	I thought Tom looked like he was amused by that.
6233923	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what he should do.
6233924	eng	Who swam with Tom?
6233925	eng	I plan on living in Boston even after I graduate.
6233926	eng	I thought Tom didn't know how to play the banjo.
6233927	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what he has to do.
6233928	eng	When did Tom swim?
6233929	eng	I may have to stay in Boston for a few more days.
6233930	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be enthusiastic about that.
6233931	eng	Tom probably doesn't have time to do that this week.
6233932	eng	We didn't ask Tom.
6233933	eng	I know you don't want to do that, but you should.
6233934	eng	I think Tom would be surprised if that happened.
6233935	eng	Tom plans to come back to Boston after he graduates.
6233936	eng	Was Tom in Boston?
6233937	eng	I just found out that you used to live in Boston.
6233938	eng	I think Tom would be impressed by this painting.
6233939	eng	Tom performs with a jazz band several times a month.
6233940	eng	Was Tom a teacher?
6233941	eng	I have to live in Boston for another three years.
6233942	eng	I think Tom won't be through doing that by 2:30.
6233943	eng	Tom often falls asleep while listening to the radio.
6233944	eng	This hat is Tom's.
6233945	eng	I gained a lot of weight while I was on vacation.
6233946	eng	I think Tom won't be present at today's meeting.
6233948	eng	This dog is Tom's.
6233949	eng	I don't want to try doing that without some help.
6233950	eng	I think Tom will likely not know how to do that.
6233951	eng	Tom must've been about three years old at that time.
6233952	eng	That car is Tom's.
6233953	eng	I don't want to think about that problem anymore.
6233954	eng	I think Tom will give you permission to do that.
6233955	eng	Tom may have to go to Boston on business next month.
6233956	eng	Only Tom did that.
6233957	eng	I don't usually carry much with me when I travel.
6233958	eng	I think Tom will be surprised when that happens.
6233959	eng	Tom looks more like his grandfather than his father.
6233960	eng	Maybe Tom is sick.
6233961	eng	I don't think it's depressing for you to do that.
6233962	eng	I think Tom will be finished doing that by 2:30.
6233963	eng	Tom likes to read on the train on his way to school.
6233964	eng	Is Tom afraid yet?
6233965	eng	I don't think it would be interesting to do that.
6233966	eng	I think Tom will be exhausted when he gets home.
6233967	eng	Tom knows how to do that better than most people do.
6233968	eng	I've seen Tom cry.
6233969	eng	I don't think doing this would be worth our time.
6233970	eng	I think Tom will be embarrassed if that happens.
6233971	eng	Tom knows he's supposed to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6233972	eng	I want to hug Tom.
6233973	eng	I don't think any of us will get rich doing this.
6233974	eng	I think Tom will be difficult to get along with.
6233975	eng	Tom knew he shouldn't do that, but he did it anyway.
6233976	eng	I think Tom is up.
6233977	eng	I don't think I'll ever be able to do that again.
6233978	eng	I think Tom will be able to do that if he tries.
6233979	eng	Tom knew he might be required to do that by himself.
6233980	eng	I sold Tom my car.
6233981	eng	I don't think I'll be present at today's meeting.
6233982	eng	I think Tom went into the woods to kill himself.
6233983	eng	Tom isn't very likely to be arrested for doing that.
6233984	eng	I saw Tom do that.
6233985	eng	I don't remember doing what everybody says I did.
6233986	eng	I think Tom may come to Boston for Thanksgiving.
6233987	eng	Tom isn't likely to be the next one to do that.
6233988	eng	I had Tom do that.
6233989	eng	I don't really feel like drinking beer right now.
6233990	eng	I think Tom isn't sure that's what he has to do.
6233991	eng	Tom isn't likely to be the last one to do that.
6233992	eng	I do that for Tom.
6233993	eng	I don't need to be at the meeting this afternoon.
6233994	eng	I think Tom is glad that that's going to happen.
6233995	eng	Tom isn't likely to be finished doing that yet.
6233996	eng	I didn't stop Tom.
6233997	eng	I don't like women who wear way too much makeup.
6233998	eng	I think Tom has decided to study French instead.
6233999	eng	Tom isn't likely to be excused from doing that.
6234000	eng	I didn't hear Tom.
6234001	eng	I don't know who I should ask to help me do that.
6234002	eng	I think Tom goes to Boston at least once a year.
6234003	eng	Tom is too skinny to look good in clothes like that.
6234004	eng	Has Tom done that?
6234005	eng	I don't know whether I can do that, but I'll try.
6234006	eng	I think Tom could be a teacher if he wanted to be.
6234007	eng	Tom is the only person I know who drinks white wine.
6234008	eng	Did Tom sing well?
6234009	eng	I don't know how much time it'll take to do that.
6234010	eng	I think I'd be able to do that if Tom helped me.
6234011	eng	Tom is someone we all think will be able to do that.
6234012	eng	Did you like Tom?
6234013	eng	I don't know how long the party is going to last.
6234014	eng	I still haven't answered all of Tom's questions.
6234015	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who want to do that.
6234016	eng	Did Tom buy that?
6234017	eng	I don't know anything about computer programming.
6234018	eng	I should've told Tom why he had to go to Boston.
6234019	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who need to do that.
6234020	eng	We hid from Tom.
6234021	eng	I don't have to be at the meeting this afternoon.
6234022	eng	I should've asked Tom for permission to do that.
6234023	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who have to do that.
6234024	eng	I owe Tom $300.
6234025	eng	I don't have as much free time as I used to have.
6234026	eng	I should tell Tom I won't go to Boston with him.
6234027	eng	Tom has worked as a barber for the last three years.
6234028	eng	I don't go to the movies as often as I'd like to.
6234029	eng	I should probably tell Tom why I had to do that.
6234030	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what we should do.
6234031	eng	I didn't want to follow in my father's footsteps.
6234032	eng	I should probably tell Tom that I need his help.
6234033	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out what he has to do.
6234034	eng	I didn't think you were interested in modern art.
6234035	eng	I should probably tell Tom that I can't do that.
6234036	eng	Tom has been told that he isn't required to do that.
6234037	eng	I didn't think you were interested in doing that.
6234038	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm going to do that.
6234039	eng	Tom grows several kinds of vegetables in his garden.
6234040	eng	I didn't think that you would be able to do that.
6234041	eng	I should know better than to ask Tom for a loan.
6234042	eng	Tom goes ice skating almost every day in the winter.
6234043	eng	I didn't think I'd ever have a chance to do that.
6234044	eng	I sat down next to Tom and he poured me a drink.
6234045	eng	Tom explained why it would be a bad idea to do that.
6234046	eng	I didn't think I would be in my office on Monday.
6234047	eng	I really should've told Tom not to go to Boston.
6234048	eng	Tom drinks at least one cup of coffee every morning.
6234049	eng	I didn't think I was going to be able to do that.
6234050	eng	I pretty much always do the same thing Tom does.
6234051	eng	Tom doesn't think he could do that without our help.
6234052	eng	I didn't start to write songs until I was thirty.
6234053	eng	I never thought Tom would want to do that again.
6234054	eng	Tom doesn't speak French well enough to do that job.
6234055	eng	I didn't need to stay in Boston as long as I did.
6234056	eng	I never thought Tom would need to do that again.
6234057	eng	Tom doesn't seem convinced that he needs to do that.
6234058	eng	I didn't learn how to do that until I was thirty.
6234059	eng	I never thought Tom would have to do that again.
6234060	eng	Tom doesn't like to do that, but he'll do it anyway.
6234061	eng	I didn't know you were supposed to do that today.
6234062	eng	I know Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to do that.
6234063	eng	Tom doesn't know whether he needs to do that or not.
6234064	eng	I didn't know you were still planning to do that.
6234065	eng	I hope that Tom won't do that until I get there.
6234066	eng	Tom doesn't know that now isn't the time to do that.
6234067	eng	I didn't know you used to teach French in Boston.
6234068	eng	I hope Tom knows why he doesn't need to do that.
6234069	eng	Tom didn't think that the judge's decision was fair.
6234070	eng	I didn't know who was going to be at the meeting.
6234071	eng	I hope Tom knows why he doesn't have to do that.
6234072	eng	Tom didn't tell me he'd never been to Boston before.
6234073	eng	I didn't know that you were the one who did that.
6234074	eng	I have no objection to your doing that with Tom.
6234075	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he should do that.
6234076	eng	I didn't know how to ride a bicycle at that time.
6234077	eng	I have a feeling Tom will need to do that today.
6234078	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why he had to do that.
6234079	eng	I didn't know how much money I was going to need.
6234080	eng	I doubt very seriously that that will scare Tom.
6234081	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who to give the envelope to.
6234082	eng	I didn't know anything about Boston at that time.
6234083	eng	I doubt very seriously that that will annoy Tom.
6234084	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
6234085	eng	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that today.
6234086	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be present.
6234087	eng	Tom didn't seem convinced that he needed to do that.
6234088	eng	I didn't have very many friends when I was a kid.
6234089	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be nervous.
6234090	eng	Tom didn't learn how to do that until he was thirty.
6234091	eng	I didn't have to stay in Boston as long as I did.
6234092	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be jealous.
6234093	eng	Tom didn't know how much money he was going to need.
6234094	eng	I didn't have enough time to do what I had to do.
6234095	eng	I doubt if Tom will be the first one to do that.
6234096	eng	Tom didn't know he wasn't supposed to do that today.
6234097	eng	I didn't have a driver's license until last year.
6234098	eng	I doubt if Tom will be interested in doing that.
6234099	eng	Tom didn't know anything at all about the situation.
6234100	eng	I didn't expect the test to be as easy as it was.
6234101	eng	I don't want to do this, but Tom says I have to.
6234102	eng	Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that by myself.
6234103	eng	I didn't do that because I didn't think I had to.
6234104	eng	I don't want to do anything that will upset Tom.
6234105	eng	Tom could've been nervous, but he didn't seem to be.
6234106	eng	I didn't do that because I didn't have any money.
6234107	eng	I don't think you could persuade Tom to do that.
6234108	eng	Tom could've been frightened, but he didn't show it.
6234109	eng	I didn't do any of the work I was supposed to do.
6234110	eng	I don't think there's any way Tom could do that.
6234111	eng	Tom confessed that he was the one who had done that.
6234112	eng	I didn't begin to write songs until I was thirty.
6234113	eng	I don't think that Tom was the one who did that.
6234114	eng	Tom came into the room with a glass of orange juice.
6234115	eng	I definitely want to do that soon, but not today.
6234116	eng	I don't think Tom would ever be able to do that.
6234117	eng	Tom asked if he really needed to do that by himself.
6234118	eng	I always order the same thing at this restaurant.
6234119	eng	I don't think Tom would do what you said he did.
6234120	eng	Tom and I've known each other for about three years.
6234121	eng	How much time do you think it'll take to do that?
6234122	eng	I don't think Tom would be reluctant to do that.
6234123	eng	Tom and I've decided to leave right after breakfast.
6234124	eng	How many years have you already spent doing that?
6234125	eng	I don't think Tom would be motivated to do that.
6234126	eng	Tom and I usually leave the office at the same time.
6234127	eng	How many weeks have you already spent doing that?
6234128	eng	I don't think Tom would be concerned about that.
6234129	eng	Tom and I swim together at least three times a week.
6234130	eng	How many months does it actually take to do that?
6234131	eng	I don't think Tom will ever come back to Boston.
6234132	eng	Tom and I studied together the day before yesterday.
6234133	eng	How many hours will it take you to get to Boston?
6234134	eng	I don't think Tom will be in Boston next spring.
6234135	eng	Tom and I send each other text messages quite often.
6234136	eng	How many hours have you already spent doing that?
6234137	eng	I don't think Tom will be here until after 2:30.
6234138	eng	Tom and I reached for the doorknob at the same time.
6234139	eng	How many days do you think it'll take to do that?
6234140	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that by himself.
6234141	eng	Tom and I probably won't see each other for a while.
6234142	eng	How long have you been trying to sell your house?
6234143	eng	I don't think Tom will be awake when I get home.
6234144	eng	Tom and I have been working together for many years.
6234145	eng	Don't you think it would be unethical to do that?
6234146	eng	I don't think Tom really wants to do that today.
6234147	eng	Tom and I hardly ever speak to each other in French.
6234148	eng	Don't you think it would be dangerous to do that?
6234149	eng	I don't think Tom really wants to do that again.
6234150	eng	Tom admitted he was the one who ate all the cookies.
6234151	eng	Doing that will take more time than I have today.
6234152	eng	I don't think Tom really has to do that anymore.
6234153	eng	Tom's new wife is younger than his oldest daughter.
6234154	eng	Do you really think it would be wrong to do that?
6234155	eng	I don't think Tom has to do that until tomorrow.
6234156	eng	Tom wouldn't have yelled at me if I'd been on time.
6234157	eng	Do you really think it would be tough to do that?
6234158	eng	I don't think Tom has overstepped his authority.
6234159	eng	Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to do that, would he?
6234160	eng	Do you really think it would be smart to do that?
6234161	eng	I don't think Tom has ever done that by himself.
6234162	eng	Tom would like to know the reason why you did that.
6234163	eng	Do you really think it would be silly to do that?
6234164	eng	I don't really feel like going camping with Tom.
6234165	eng	Tom would like to hear the reason why you did that.
6234166	eng	Do you really think it would be risky to do that?
6234167	eng	I don't really care whether Tom likes me or not.
6234168	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without a lot of help.
6234169	eng	Do you really think it would be cheap to do that?
6234170	eng	I don't like the same kind of music as Tom does.
6234171	eng	Tom will probably do that today while I'm not here.
6234172	eng	Do you know any other way I could try doing that?
6234173	eng	I don't like the same kind of books as Tom does.
6234174	eng	Tom will probably be very hungry when he gets home.
6234175	eng	Do you consider yourself to be a generous person?
6234176	eng	I don't know why Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
6234177	eng	Tom will probably be gone by the time we get there.
6234178	eng	Do people ever been criticize you for doing that?
6234179	eng	I don't know who Tom wants to go to Boston with.
6234180	eng	Tom will be waiting for me in front of the station.
6234181	eng	Didn't you know you didn't have to be here today?
6234182	eng	I don't know whether Tom is able to do that or not.
6234183	eng	Tom went out for a walk even though it was raining.
6234184	eng	Did you know you weren't going to pass the class?
6234185	eng	I don't know when Tom will get back from Boston.
6234186	eng	Tom was the only other student who failed the test.
6234187	eng	Can you tell me exactly what you're trying to do?
6234188	eng	I don't know if Tom wants to go with you or not.
6234189	eng	Tom was the only other person who couldn't do that.
6234190	eng	As I told you before, I'm never going to do that.
6234191	eng	I don't know how much money Tom has in the bank.
6234192	eng	Tom was the first person to ever ask me to do that.
6234193	eng	Are we supposed to stop when the light is yellow?
6234194	eng	I don't know how long I'll have to wait for Tom.
6234195	eng	Tom was the first one who spoke to me this morning.
6234196	eng	Are we likely to be in Boston on Valentine's Day?
6234197	eng	I don't have as many pairs of socks as Tom does.
6234198	eng	Tom was the first one to tell us about the problem.
6234199	eng	Are all your brothers and sisters musicians, too?
6234200	eng	I didn't want to say anything to make Tom angry.
6234201	eng	Tom was standing outside the restaurant looking in.
6234202	eng	You've done that a couple of times, haven't you?
6234203	eng	I didn't want to do this, but Tom said I had to.
6234204	eng	Tom wanted to know what we expected to happen next.
6234205	eng	You're the only person I know who can't do that.
6234206	eng	I didn't want to be there and Tom didn't either.
6234207	eng	Tom told me why it would be a good idea to do that.
6234208	eng	You're the only one who was supposed to do that.
6234209	eng	I didn't think Tom would be in Boston this week.
6234210	eng	Tom told me that he was the one who had to do that.
6234211	eng	You're the first person to ever ask me for help.
6234212	eng	I didn't think Tom would be hesitant to do that.
6234213	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't know what he should do.
6234214	eng	You're lucky nobody saw you do that, aren't you?
6234215	eng	I didn't think Tom would be embarrassed by that.
6234216	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't know what he has to do.
6234217	eng	You're likely the only person who can't do that.
6234218	eng	I didn't think Tom was the first one to do that.
6234219	eng	Tom told me that I needed to go to today's meeting.
6234220	eng	You'll soon be able to do that without any help.
6234221	eng	I didn't think Tom was interested in doing that.
6234222	eng	Tom told me that I needed to be at today's meeting.
6234223	eng	You won't have to do that by yourself, will you?
6234224	eng	I didn't think Tom was in his office on Mondays.
6234225	eng	Tom told me he thought it would be safe to do that.
6234226	eng	You won't have to do anything you don't want to.
6234227	eng	I didn't tell Tom to take his umbrella with him.
6234228	eng	Tom thought he would be able to do that by himself.
6234229	eng	You weren't surprised that I did that, were you?
6234230	eng	I didn't tell Tom I didn't have time to do that.
6234231	eng	Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
6234232	eng	You weren't given a chance to do that, were you?
6234233	eng	I didn't say anything about the accident to Tom.
6234234	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he's going to do that.
6234235	eng	You weren't able to do that yesterday, were you?
6234236	eng	I didn't mean to tell Tom about that, but I did.
6234237	eng	Tom should've stayed in Boston for a few more days.
6234238	eng	You weren't able to do that very well, were you?
6234239	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was having fun or not.
6234240	eng	Tom should've been able to show you how to do that.
6234241	eng	You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
6234242	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was a Canadian or not.
6234243	eng	Tom should be able to do that with his eyes closed.
6234244	eng	You were going to do that yourself, weren't you?
6234245	eng	I didn't know what to give Tom for his birthday.
6234246	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him what I'd done.
6234247	eng	You used to be a physical therapist, didn't you?
6234248	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom broke his leg.
6234249	eng	Tom says he'll finish the work as soon as possible.
6234250	eng	You think that I did that on purpose, don't you?
6234251	eng	I didn't know that Tom wouldn't be at the party.
6234252	eng	Tom says he thinks it might not be wise to do that.
6234253	eng	You think I won't be able to do that, don't you?
6234254	eng	I didn't know that Tom used to teach you French.
6234255	eng	Tom says he thinks it might not be safe to do that.
6234256	eng	You think I was the one who did that, don't you?
6234257	eng	I didn't know that Tom liked to play volleyball.
6234258	eng	Tom says he thinks it might not be easy to do that.
6234259	eng	You think I really wanted to do that, don't you?
6234260	eng	I didn't know how to do what Tom asked me to do.
6234261	eng	Tom says he saves a lot of money by buying in bulk.
6234262	eng	You think I really needed to do that, don't you?
6234263	eng	I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that today.
6234264	eng	Tom says he regrets that he wasn't able to do that.
6234265	eng	You think I could do that if I tried, don't you?
6234266	eng	I didn't know Tom was still planning to do that.
6234267	eng	Tom says he just wants to make sure that gets done.
6234268	eng	You shouldn't do that kind of thing by yourself.
6234269	eng	I didn't know Tom was planning to do that today.
6234270	eng	Tom says he has to find someone to do that for him.
6234271	eng	You should've done that when you had the chance.
6234272	eng	I didn't have time to explain everything to Tom.
6234273	eng	Tom says he forgot that he'd promised to do that.
6234274	eng	You promised you'd do that before you went home.
6234275	eng	I didn't have the heart to refuse Tom's request.
6234276	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can do that right now.
6234277	eng	You promised us you wouldn't ever do that again.
6234278	eng	How many years has Tom already spent doing that?
6234279	eng	Tom says he doesn't remember asking you to do that.
6234280	eng	You promised us that you wouldn't do that again.
6234281	eng	How many weeks has Tom already spent doing that?
6234282	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how old his dog is.
6234283	eng	You promised that you'd do that, but you didn't.
6234284	eng	How many times have you told Tom not to do that?
6234285	eng	Tom says he doesn't know if he has time to do that.
6234286	eng	You never thought I'd help you do that, did you?
6234287	eng	How many more years will it take Tom to do that?
6234288	eng	Tom says he doesn't have time to do that right now.
6234289	eng	You need to be strong to do something like that.
6234290	eng	How many more weeks will it take Tom to do that?
6234291	eng	Tom says he doesn't have the confidence to do that.
6234292	eng	You know why I'm supposed to do that, don't you?
6234293	eng	How many more hours will it take Tom to do that?
6234294	eng	Tom says he doesn't care whether we do that or not.
6234295	eng	You know why I don't need to do that, don't you?
6234296	eng	How many hours has Tom already spent doing that?
6234297	eng	Tom says he didn't know he was supposed to do that.
6234298	eng	You know why I don't have to do that, don't you?
6234300	eng	Tom said there wasn't anything he could do to help.
6234301	eng	You know what'll happen if I do that, don't you?
6234302	eng	Do you think you could stop Tom from doing that?
6234303	eng	Tom said there are no meetings scheduled for today.
6234304	eng	You know I'm not supposed to do that, don't you?
6234305	eng	Do you think Tom would mind if I didn't do that?
6234306	eng	Tom said that wasn't likely to happen this morning.
6234307	eng	You know I shouldn't do that anymore, don't you?
6234308	eng	Do you think Tom would ever consider doing that?
6234309	eng	Tom said that his grandfather is living by himself.
6234310	eng	You know I no longer need to do that, don't you?
6234311	eng	Do you really think Tom doesn't have to do that?
6234312	eng	Tom said that he really didn't know how to do that.
6234313	eng	You knew I'd likely have to do that, didn't you?
6234314	eng	Do you mean you didn't actually see Tom do that?
6234315	eng	Tom said that he didn't really know how to do that.
6234316	eng	You knew I wouldn't want to do that, didn't you?
6234317	eng	Do you know what kind of apartment Tom lives in?
6234318	eng	Tom said that I should do that as soon as possible.
6234319	eng	You knew I wouldn't have to do that, didn't you?
6234320	eng	Do you have any idea what Tom is planning to do?
6234321	eng	Tom said it should've been a lot easier to do that.
6234322	eng	You don't want to have to do that again, do you?
6234323	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to live in Boston?
6234324	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to help if we needed help.
6234325	eng	You don't think I'll be able to do that, do you?
6234326	eng	Didn't you know that Tom didn't want to do that?
6234327	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be permitted to do that again.
6234328	eng	You don't think I need to do that today, do you?
6234329	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to be a French teacher?
6234330	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't left the windows open.
6234331	eng	You don't seem convinced that I need to do that.
6234332	eng	Did you know that Tom wasn't having a good time?
6234333	eng	Tom said he wasn't in good enough shape to do that.
6234334	eng	You don't seem convinced that I have to do that.
6234335	eng	Did you know Tom used to teach French in Boston?
6234336	eng	Tom said he was the only one who wanted to do that.
6234337	eng	You don't really want to live in Boston, do you?
6234338	eng	As soon as Tom has finished work, we'll do that.
6234339	eng	Tom said he was the only one who needed to do that.
6234340	eng	You don't really think I had to do that, do you?
6234341	eng	Are you and Tom still not talking to each other?
6234342	eng	Tom said he was thankful for the chance to do that.
6234343	eng	You don't have to eat that if you don't want to.
6234344	eng	You're the only one who ever really helped Tom.
6234345	eng	Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
6234346	eng	You don't have the authority to do that, do you?
6234347	eng	You won't allow Tom to do that again, will you?
6234348	eng	Tom said he thought that would probably not happen.
6234349	eng	You didn't think that we could do that, did you?
6234350	eng	You weren't expecting Tom to do that, were you?
6234351	eng	Tom said he thought that would likely never happen.
6234352	eng	You didn't think I'd do that by myself, did you?
6234353	eng	You weren't able to help Tom do that, were you?
6234354	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that for me.
6234355	eng	You didn't really feel like doing that, did you?
6234356	eng	You were hoping Tom could do that, weren't you?
6234357	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to do that.
6234358	eng	You didn't realize I needed to do that, did you?
6234359	eng	You were expecting Tom to do that, weren't you?
6234360	eng	Tom said he thought he might be allowed to do that.
6234361	eng	You didn't know I was still doing that, did you?
6234362	eng	You told Tom I knew how to do that, didn't you?
6234363	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what needed to be done.
6234364	eng	You didn't have a good time doing that, did you?
6234365	eng	You told Tom I intended to do that, didn't you?
6234366	eng	Tom said he thought doing that wouldn't be any fun.
6234367	eng	You didn't do that as quickly as you usually do.
6234368	eng	You told Tom I could do that today, didn't you?
6234369	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be worthwhile.
6234370	eng	Would you like to come to Boston for the summer?
6234371	eng	You think Tom won't want to do that, don't you?
6234372	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be a bad idea.
6234373	eng	Would it be better to do that today or tomorrow?
6234374	eng	You think Tom won't need to do that, don't you?
6234375	eng	Tom said he sees a lot of dead animals on the road.
6234376	eng	Why don't you stay here with us for a few weeks?
6234377	eng	You think Tom won't like to do that, don't you?
6234378	eng	Tom said he saved a lot of money by buying in bulk.
6234379	eng	Why aren't you doing what we've asked you to do?
6234380	eng	You think Tom won't like doing that, don't you?
6234381	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't be at home on Monday.
6234382	eng	Who gets up earlier, your mother or your father?
6234383	eng	You think Tom won't have to do that, don't you?
6234384	eng	Tom said he left early because he was feeling sick.
6234385	eng	Where in Australia would you most like to visit?
6234386	eng	You think Tom will do that tomorrow, don't you?
6234387	eng	Tom said he knew he might have to do that tomorrow.
6234388	eng	When was the last time you hugged your children?
6234389	eng	You think Tom will actually do that, don't you?
6234390	eng	Tom said he doesn't have the confidence to do that.
6234391	eng	What do you think is the easiest way to do that?
6234392	eng	You should wait until Tom gets here to do that.
6234393	eng	Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
6234394	eng	Weren't you the one who was supposed to do that?
6234395	eng	You should tell Tom that you intend to do that.
6234396	eng	Tom said he didn't want to say anything about that.
6234397	eng	We've never met, but I've heard a lot about you.
6234398	eng	You should probably tell Tom you won't do that.
6234399	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go camping next weekend.
6234400	eng	We're fortunate that we're permitted to do that.
6234401	eng	You should probably tell Tom you can't do that.
6234402	eng	Tom said he didn't want to ever go to Boston again.
6234403	eng	We stayed in Boston for three weeks last spring.
6234404	eng	You should let Tom know that you won't do that.
6234405	eng	Tom said he didn't know who to give the package to.
6234406	eng	We shouldn't have stayed in Boston so many days.
6234407	eng	You should let Tom know that you can't do that.
6234408	eng	Tom said he didn't know if he'd be able to do that.
6234409	eng	We probably won't get another chance to do this.
6234410	eng	You should get Tom to teach you how to do that.
6234411	eng	Tom said he couldn't do that because he's too busy.
6234412	eng	We might need to be in Boston for several weeks.
6234413	eng	You refused to tell Tom to do that, didn't you?
6234414	eng	Tom said he didn't have many opportunities to do that.
6234415	eng	We may have to go to Boston the week after next.
6234416	eng	You need to make sure that Tom doesn't do that.
6234417	eng	Tom said I didn't have to help if I didn't want to.
6234418	eng	We had to stay in Boston for another three days.
6234419	eng	You know that Tom shouldn't do that, don't you?
6234420	eng	Tom refused to tell me where he was planning to go.
6234421	eng	We don't want to be in Boston during the winter.
6234422	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't do that, didn't you?
6234423	eng	Tom promised me that he wouldn't lie to me anymore.
6234424	eng	We both want to stay in Boston for another week.
6234425	eng	You knew that Tom couldn't do that, didn't you?
6234426	eng	Tom promised himself that he'd never do that again.
6234427	eng	Visiting Australia was a good experience for me.
6234428	eng	You knew Tom would help me do that, didn't you?
6234429	eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that without help.
6234430	eng	Unfortunately, I wasn't smart enough to do that.
6234431	eng	You knew Tom said he would do that, didn't you?
6234432	eng	Tom probably thought he was going to be busy today.
6234433	eng	This area has changed a lot since we moved here.
6234434	eng	You knew I had to help Tom do that, didn't you?
6234435	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I think he's stupid.
6234436	eng	There'll come a day when you'll want to do that.
6234437	eng	You have to make sure that Tom doesn't do that.
6234438	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to play the mandolin.
6234439	eng	There'll come a day when you'll need to do that.
6234440	eng	You have no idea why Tom wanted you to do that.
6234441	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much time he'll need.
6234442	eng	There'll come a day when you'll have to do that.
6234443	eng	You don't really think Tom can do that, do you?
6234444	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much money was taken.
6234445	eng	The woman talking on her phone seemed irritated.
6234446	eng	You don't really expect Tom to do that, do you?
6234447	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's supposed to do that.
6234448	eng	The people waiting for the bus seemed impatient.
6234449	eng	You don't know why Tom kept doing that, do you?
6234450	eng	Tom probably doesn't know any other way to do that.
6234451	eng	The movie was better than I thought it would be.
6234452	eng	You didn't want Tom to do that for me, did you?
6234453	eng	Tom needs to be back in Boston as soon as possible.
6234454	eng	The lady wearing sunglasses seemed very strange.
6234455	eng	You didn't realize Tom had to do that, did you?
6234456	eng	Tom must've done that yesterday before we got here.
6234457	eng	The girl wearing headphones seemed to be asleep.
6234458	eng	You didn't pronounce Tom's last name correctly.
6234459	eng	Tom must've been tired when he got home last night.
6234460	eng	The girl carrying a mandolin was very beautiful.
6234461	eng	You didn't know Tom wanted to do that, did you?
6234462	eng	Tom might need to go to Boston the week after next.
6234463	eng	So far, you're the only person who's complained.
6234464	eng	You didn't know Tom shouldn't do that, did you?
6234465	eng	Tom managed to get out of the car without any help.
6234466	eng	Since it rained the whole day, I stayed indoors.
6234467	eng	You didn't know Tom needed to do that, did you?
6234468	eng	Tom knows he should've been able to do that better.
6234469	eng	People might think you're crazy if you did that.
6234470	eng	You asked Tom not to do that again, didn't you?
6234471	eng	Tom knew he might be allowed to do that by himself.
6234472	eng	One of my brothers wants to become an astronaut.
6234473	eng	You asked Tom if he had to do that, didn't you?
6234474	eng	Tom isn't very likely to figure out how to do that.
6234475	eng	My speech will only be about three minutes long.
6234476	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you'll do that?
6234477	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't want to do that.
6234478	eng	My parents own the grocery store on Park Street.
6234479	eng	Who told you Tom had been released from prison?
6234480	eng	Tom isn't patient enough to do something like that.
6234481	eng	My family moved around a lot when I was a young.
6234482	eng	We need to take Tom to the hospital right away.
6234483	eng	Tom isn't likely to be through doing that yet.
6234484	eng	My blood pressure has been pretty high recently.
6234485	eng	We have to take Tom to the hospital right away.
6234486	eng	Tom isn't coming back to Boston until next October.
6234487	eng	Most people will probably choose not to do that.
6234488	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever complained.
6234489	eng	Tom is too intelligent to ever consider doing that.
6234490	eng	Most people here don't know how to speak French.
6234491	eng	The last time Tom did that was three years ago.
6234492	eng	Tom is too intelligent to even consider doing that.
6234493	eng	Most people don't like to do that when it's hot.
6234494	eng	The boy wearing the purple baseball cap is Tom.
6234495	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be worried.
6234496	eng	Maybe it would be unsafe to do that by yourself.
6234497	eng	Some of the people who work with Tom are Canadians.
6234498	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be working.
6234499	eng	Mary didn't drink at all while she was pregnant.
6234500	eng	Please tell me whether Tom will do that or not.
6234501	eng	Tom is taller than all the other boys in his class.
6234502	eng	Many people don't know that peanuts aren't nuts.
6234503	eng	Please tell Tom to do that as soon as possible.
6234504	eng	Tom is smarter than any other student in his class.
6234505	eng	It's really hard to tell what's going to happen.
6234506	eng	Please listen carefully to what Tom has to say.
6234507	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who needed to do that.
6234508	eng	It's fun to try lots of different kinds of food.
6234509	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't play the saxophone anymore.
6234510	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were evacuated.
6234511	eng	It's already been three months since I did that.
6234512	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what you're looking for.
6234513	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who had to do that.
6234514	eng	It'll probably be impossible for you to do that.
6234515	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what he did was illegal.
6234516	eng	Tom is on the porch with three friends from school.
6234517	eng	It'll be impossible to do that, don't you think?
6234518	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that won't happen today.
6234519	eng	Tom is likely to still be interested in doing that.
6234520	eng	It would be disappointing if you didn't do that.
6234521	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he has to do that today.
6234522	eng	Tom is going back to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6234523	eng	I'm the only one who seems to be having any fun.
6234524	eng	It's your responsibility to get Tom to do that.
6234525	eng	Tom is from a small town about 300 miles from here.
6234526	eng	I'm still the same weight I was three years ago.
6234527	eng	It's not necessary for Tom to go there himself.
6234528	eng	Tom is bigger than all the other boys in his class.
6234529	eng	I'm still going to Boston several times a month.
6234530	eng	It's impossible for Tom to do that before dark.
6234531	eng	Tom is a someone I have trouble getting along with.
6234532	eng	I'm not the only one who wants to go home early.
6234533	eng	It'll probably be dangerous for Tom to do that.
6234534	eng	Tom is a much better singer now than he used to be.
6234535	eng	I'd understand it if you didn't want to do that.
6234536	eng	It looks like Tom is pretty good at doing that.
6234537	eng	Tom hasn't been able to do that since his accident.
6234538	eng	I'd like to do that with you, but I can't today.
6234539	eng	It doesn't matter whether Tom does that or not.
6234540	eng	Tom has worn the same hat for at least three years.
6234541	eng	I would've visited Boston if I'd had the chance.
6234542	eng	Is it necessary for Tom to go there by himself?
6234543	eng	Tom has worked as a cowboy since he was a teenager.
6234544	eng	I would've gone to Boston if I'd had the chance.
6234545	eng	Is Tom going to play the guitar for us tonight?
6234546	eng	Tom has newer tires on his car than I have on mine.
6234547	eng	I won't stay in Boston for more than three days.
6234548	eng	If Tom wants to do that, I'll do that with him.
6234549	eng	Tom has just done what he should've done last week.
6234550	eng	I wish you wouldn't do that by yourself anymore.
6234551	eng	I've heard that Tom doesn't do that very often.
6234552	eng	Tom has enough time to do that before he goes home.
6234553	eng	I wish I didn't have to help with the housework.
6234554	eng	I've already forgotten Tom's girlfriend's name.
6234555	eng	Tom has come out of his coma and is getting better.
6234556	eng	I went to a jazz festival the month before last.
6234557	eng	I'm the only one who ever really talked to Tom.
6234558	eng	Tom has been trying to figure that out all morning.
6234559	eng	I wanted to go home and eat dinner with my wife.
6234560	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be happy if you did that.
6234561	eng	Tom has been studying French for a year and a half.
6234562	eng	I want to know what time you'll be getting here.
6234563	eng	I'm sure Tom would be happy to do that for you.
6234564	eng	Tom has been in the waiting room for the past hour.
6234565	eng	I want to finish eating before I talk to anyone.
6234566	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be the first one to do that.
6234567	eng	Tom has been doing that for three and a half years.
6234568	eng	I thought you were supposed to be there by 2:30.
6234569	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be interested in doing that.
6234570	eng	Tom has a few things he needs to do this afternoon.
6234571	eng	I thought you were asked not to do that anymore.
6234572	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be awake this late at night.
6234573	eng	Tom had already eaten when I got to the restaurant.
6234574	eng	I thought you said you've done that three times.
6234575	eng	I'm sure Tom will be through doing that by now.
6234576	eng	Tom found his old camera in the back of his closet.
6234577	eng	I thought you said you'd never done that before.
6234578	eng	I'm sure Tom will be amused by what's going on.
6234579	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that because it's dangerous.
6234580	eng	I thought you said you weren't going to do that.
6234581	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be doing that now.
6234582	eng	Tom doesn't enjoy doing that as much as he used to.
6234583	eng	I thought you said you were hesitant to do that.
6234584	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom used to be able to do that.
6234585	eng	Tom didn't want to admit he wasn't able to do that.
6234586	eng	I thought you said you were finished doing that.
6234587	eng	I'm not sure whether Tom has to do that or not.
6234588	eng	Tom didn't want to admit he didn't know what to do.
6234589	eng	I thought you said someone asked you to do that.
6234590	eng	I'm not going to permit Tom to do that anymore.
6234591	eng	Tom didn't think that you would be able to do that.
6234592	eng	I thought you didn't know how to play the banjo.
6234593	eng	I'd rather stay here than go swimming with Tom.
6234594	eng	Tom didn't think I was going to be able to do that.
6234595	eng	I think you and I are staying at the same hotel.
6234596	eng	I'd rather stay here than go anywhere with Tom.
6234597	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who to give the package to.
6234598	eng	I think that if you tried to do that, you could.
6234599	eng	I'd be very disappointed if Tom didn't do that.
6234600	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he should do that.
6234601	eng	I think it would be safe to do that by yourself.
6234602	eng	I wouldn't permit Tom to do that if I were you.
6234603	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that he had to do that.
6234604	eng	I think it would be dangerous for us to do that.
6234605	eng	I work at the same supermarket where Tom works.
6234606	eng	Tom didn't provide details of how he would do that.
6234607	eng	I think it would be a good idea to take a break.
6234608	eng	I wonder why Tom still lives in that old house.
6234609	eng	Tom didn't look like he was in a hurry to get home.
6234610	eng	I think it might not be so expensive to do that.
6234611	eng	I wonder if Tom was able to do that by himself.
6234612	eng	Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that today.
6234613	eng	I think doing that might take about three hours.
6234614	eng	I wonder if Tom is desperate enough to do that.
6234615	eng	Tom didn't know that you were the one who did that.
6234616	eng	I think I'm the one who was supposed to do that.
6234617	eng	I wish Tom wouldn't do that by himself anymore.
6234618	eng	Tom didn't know that we were the ones who did that.
6234619	eng	I stayed indoors all day because it was raining.
6234620	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom where I hid the money.
6234621	eng	Tom didn't know that he wasn't supposed to do that.
6234622	eng	I should've gone to Boston with you last summer.
6234623	eng	I wish I could play the ukulele as well as Tom.
6234624	eng	Tom didn't know that I wanted to do that on Monday.
6234625	eng	I should've been able to do that in three hours.
6234626	eng	I wasn't the one who showed Tom how to do that.
6234627	eng	Tom didn't know that I wanted to do that by myself.
6234628	eng	I should do that now, but I don't have the time.
6234629	eng	I warned you what would happen if Tom did that.
6234630	eng	Tom didn't know how to do that until he was thirty.
6234631	eng	I propose we do something about that right away.
6234632	eng	I wanted to do that yesterday morning with Tom.
6234633	eng	Tom didn't know anything at all about the accident.
6234634	eng	I promise that I'll be with you in half an hour.
6234635	eng	I tried to help Tom escape from the kidnappers.
6234636	eng	Tom didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that today.
6234637	eng	I need three large onions and a head of cabbage.
6234638	eng	I tried to convince Tom not to do that anymore.
6234639	eng	Tom couldn't find the documents he was looking for.
6234640	eng	I might have to stay in Boston for another week.
6234641	eng	I told Tom that I don't know what I need to do.
6234642	eng	Tom could've been sleepy, but he didn't seem to be.
6234643	eng	I might be in Boston for a couple of more weeks.
6234644	eng	I told Tom it was dangerous for him to do that.
6234645	eng	Tom could've been mad, but he didn't look that way.
6234646	eng	I know I'm supposed to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6234647	eng	I told Tom I thought it would be OK to do that.
6234648	eng	Tom could make you do that, but I doubt if he will.
6234649	eng	I intend to visit Boston during my spring break.
6234650	eng	I thought you were going to ask Tom to do that.
6234651	eng	Tom could be the one responsible for what happened.
6234652	eng	I hope you get that job in Boston that you want.
6234653	eng	I thought you said you'd never let Tom do that.
6234654	eng	Tom claims he didn't know that was going to happen.
6234655	eng	I hope you can understand why I want to do that.
6234656	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy traveling with us.
6234657	eng	Tom can do that with one hand tied behind his back.
6234658	eng	I haven't yet written anything in this notebook.
6234659	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy traveling with me.
6234660	eng	Tom booked a room for me at a hotel near his house.
6234661	eng	I don't want to follow in my father's footsteps.
6234662	eng	I thought Tom would have time to do that today.
6234663	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to go to Boston with him.
6234664	eng	I don't think we could do that even if we tried.
6234665	eng	I thought Tom would be the next one to do that.
6234666	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't try doing that by myself.
6234667	eng	I don't think it's dangerous for you to do that.
6234668	eng	I thought Tom would be the last one to do that.
6234669	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't come to school on Monday.
6234670	eng	I don't think it would be depressing to do that.
6234671	eng	I thought Tom would be surprised if I did that.
6234672	eng	Tom asked me if I knew how to play the French horn.
6234673	eng	I don't think I'll ever get used to Korean food.
6234674	eng	I thought Tom wasn't going to do that tomorrow.
6234675	eng	Tom and I've started to get on each other's nerves.
6234676	eng	I don't think I'll ever get tired of doing this.
6234677	eng	I thought Tom said he liked this kind of music.
6234678	eng	Tom and I've known each other for a very long time.
6234679	eng	I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
6234680	eng	I thought Tom said he didn't have a girlfriend.
6234681	eng	Tom and I won't be able to see each other for a while.
6234682	eng	I don't think I have the time to help you today.
6234683	eng	I thought Tom might need to do that by himself.
6234684	eng	Tom and I were in the same class in primary school.
6234685	eng	I don't think I could do that without your help.
6234686	eng	I thought Tom might have to do that by himself.
6234687	eng	Tom and I were best friends when we were teenagers.
6234688	eng	I don't speak French as well as I speak English.
6234689	eng	I thought I'd forgotten to tell Tom what to do.
6234690	eng	Tom and I shared a hospital room for several weeks.
6234691	eng	I don't remember my first French teacher's name.
6234692	eng	I thought I was doing what Tom wanted me to do.
6234693	eng	Tom and I shared a bedroom when we were growing up.
6234694	eng	I don't like to ride the train during rush hour.
6234695	eng	I think Tom would be unenthusiastic about that.
6234696	eng	Tom and I are the ones who are supposed to do that.
6234697	eng	I don't like it when this kind of thing happens.
6234698	eng	I think Tom would be amused by what's going on.
6234699	eng	Tom and I are going to get married on October 20th.
6234700	eng	I don't know who I should ask to do that for me.
6234701	eng	I think Tom won't be amused by what's going on.
6234702	eng	Tom and I are getting ready to go on our honeymoon.
6234703	eng	I don't know what time I'm supposed to be there.
6234704	eng	I think Tom won't be able to do that very well.
6234705	eng	Tom already told me he doesn't know how to do that.
6234706	eng	I don't know how much time I'll need to do that.
6234707	eng	I think Tom will be present at today's meeting.
6234708	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what we wanted him to do.
6234709	eng	I don't know how much time I'll have to do that.
6234710	eng	I think Tom will be able to do that by himself.
6234711	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what he promised he'd do.
6234712	eng	I don't have enough time to get everything done.
6234713	eng	I think Tom probably won't know how to do that.
6234714	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if we forced him to do that.
6234715	eng	I don't have any money, so I can't buy any food.
6234716	eng	I think Tom might get punished if he does that.
6234717	eng	Tom would go to Boston with us if he had the time.
6234718	eng	I don't have any friends who like to go camping.
6234719	eng	I think Tom is the only one who has to do that.
6234720	eng	Tom won't likely be very hungry when he gets home.
6234721	eng	I don't feel like doing that on such a cold day.
6234722	eng	I think Tom is sure that's what he needs to do.
6234723	eng	Tom will probably be in Boston two or three years.
6234724	eng	I didn't watch much television when I was a kid.
6234725	eng	I think Tom could've done that without my help.
6234726	eng	Tom will likely be retired by this time next year.
6234727	eng	I didn't want to talk about that over the phone.
6234728	eng	I think Tom could've been reluctant to do that.
6234729	eng	Tom will go back to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6234730	eng	I didn't want to admit I wasn't able to do that.
6234731	eng	I think I know why Tom doesn't need to do that.
6234732	eng	Tom wasn't able to figure out how to open the box.
6234733	eng	I didn't want to admit I didn't know what to do.
6234734	eng	I think I know why Tom doesn't have to do that.
6234735	eng	Tom was very good at doing that when he was young.
6234736	eng	I didn't think you'd notice that I wasn't there.
6234737	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I want to do that.
6234738	eng	Tom was the first one to say we shouldn't do that.
6234739	eng	I didn't think I'd ever get used to Korean food.
6234740	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I need to do that.
6234741	eng	Tom was in the hospital for thee months last year.
6234742	eng	I didn't think I'd be able to do that by myself.
6234743	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I have to do that.
6234744	eng	Tom was going to do that the day before yesterday.
6234745	eng	I didn't think I would be in Boston for so long.
6234746	eng	I should've told Tom that he needed to do that.
6234747	eng	Tom wants me to stay in Boston until his birthday.
6234748	eng	I didn't speak French the first time you met me.
6234749	eng	I should tell Tom to be there tomorrow at 2:30.
6234750	eng	Tom used to do that, but he doesn't do it anymore.
6234751	eng	I didn't really need it, but I bought it anyway.
6234752	eng	I should probably tell Tom what he needs to do.
6234753	eng	Tom told us that it wouldn't necessary to do that.
6234754	eng	I didn't know what to do with the leftover food.
6234755	eng	I should probably tell Tom what has to be done.
6234756	eng	Tom told us that doing that wouldn't be necessary.
6234757	eng	I didn't know what time I was supposed to leave.
6234758	eng	I should probably tell Tom about what happened.
6234759	eng	Tom told me yesterday that he'll do that tomorrow.
6234760	eng	I didn't know we were supposed to do that today.
6234761	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm going to Boston.
6234762	eng	Tom told me why it would be a bad idea to do that.
6234763	eng	I didn't know that what I was doing was illegal.
6234764	eng	I should probably tell Tom I intend to do that.
6234765	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't want to do that again.
6234766	eng	I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to do that.
6234767	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I'm sleepy.
6234768	eng	Tom told me that I need to attend today's meeting.
6234769	eng	I didn't know how to drive until just last year.
6234770	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I'm hungry.
6234771	eng	Tom told me he thought it would be fun to do that.
6234772	eng	I didn't know how to do that until I was thirty.
6234773	eng	I should be able to do that without Tom's help.
6234774	eng	Tom thought he wouldn't be able to do that for me.
6234775	eng	I didn't intend to spend so much time in Boston.
6234776	eng	I said essentially the same thing that Tom did.
6234777	eng	Tom thinks that doing that wouldn't be a bad idea.
6234778	eng	I didn't have to come here yesterday, but I did.
6234779	eng	I probably should've shown Tom how to do that.
6234780	eng	Tom tends to only do what is absolutely necessary.
6234781	eng	I didn't have time to finish writing the report.
6234782	eng	I need to remember to send Tom a birthday card.
6234783	eng	Tom takes his ukulele with him everywhere he goes.
6234784	eng	I didn't have time to do what needed to be done.
6234785	eng	I know that Tom is difficult to get along with.
6234786	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he wanted to do that.
6234787	eng	I didn't have time last night to do my homework.
6234788	eng	I knew doing that would make Tom uncomfortable.
6234789	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he needed to do that.
6234790	eng	I didn't have my parents' permission to do that.
6234791	eng	I knew Tom would likely not be able to do that.
6234792	eng	Tom still hasn't learned how to do that correctly.
6234793	eng	I didn't have enough time to finish my homework.
6234794	eng	I hope Tom isn't gone by the time we get there.
6234795	eng	Tom spent a lot of time studying French last week.
6234796	eng	I didn't have enough money to go to the concert.
6234797	eng	I hope Tom is outside waiting for us right now.
6234798	eng	Tom spends a lot of money on things he never uses.
6234799	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what I wanted.
6234800	eng	I hope Tom is glad that that's going to happen.
6234801	eng	Tom spends a lot of his free time studying French.
6234802	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy what I needed.
6234803	eng	I heard that Tom isn't very good at doing that.
6234804	eng	Tom sounded like he was surprised by the question.
6234805	eng	I didn't have anything to do with what happened.
6234806	eng	I haven't told Tom about my financial problems.
6234807	eng	Tom soon realized that he shouldn't be doing that.
6234808	eng	I didn't get home until after 2:30 this morning.
6234809	eng	I have no idea why Tom was supposed to do that.
6234810	eng	Tom should've been able to do that in three hours.
6234811	eng	I didn't do what I was supposed to do yesterday.
6234812	eng	I got to know Tom while I was living in Boston.
6234813	eng	Tom should've been able to do that better than me.
6234814	eng	I didn't commit the crimes I've been accused of.
6234815	eng	I forgot to remind Tom to take out the garbage.
6234816	eng	Tom says he's looking forward to coming to Boston.
6234817	eng	I can play both tennis and baseball fairly well.
6234818	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be lonely.
6234819	eng	Tom says he'll do that whether you like it or not.
6234820	eng	I bought some peaches on the way home from work.
6234821	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be afraid.
6234822	eng	Tom says he thinks it'll be impossible to do that.
6234823	eng	How much time do you think is needed to do that?
6234824	eng	I doubt if something like that would upset Tom.
6234825	eng	Tom says he thinks it would be foolish to do that.
6234826	eng	How many weeks does it actually take to do that?
6234827	eng	I doubt if Tom will be the next one to do that.
6234828	eng	Tom says he thinks Boston is a good place to live.
6234829	eng	How many ways do you think there are to do that?
6234830	eng	I doubt if Tom will be the last one to do that.
6234831	eng	Tom says he has a special tool he uses to do that.
6234832	eng	How many seconds does it really take to do that?
6234833	eng	I doubt if Tom will be ready when we get there.
6234834	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he has to do that today.
6234835	eng	How many people live in your apartment building?
6234836	eng	I doubt if Tom will be forgiven for doing that.
6234837	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can do that just now.
6234838	eng	How many more years will it take you to do that?
6234839	eng	I doubt if Tom will be excused from doing that.
6234840	eng	Tom says he doesn't remember asking me to do that.
6234841	eng	How many more years do you think you'll do that?
6234842	eng	I don't want to do that and Tom doesn't either.
6234843	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know where he was born.
6234844	eng	How many minutes does it really take to do that?
6234845	eng	I don't want to be here and Tom doesn't either.
6234846	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what he's supposed to do.
6234847	eng	How many hours does it actually take to do that?
6234848	eng	I don't think that Tom was in Boston last week.
6234849	eng	Tom says he doesn't know any other way to do that.
6234850	eng	How many days have you already spent doing that?
6234851	eng	I don't think that Tom is the one who did that.
6234852	eng	Tom sat in his front yard, looking up at the moon.
6234853	eng	Don't you want to stay in Boston for the summer?
6234854	eng	I don't think Tom would really want to do that.
6234855	eng	Tom said there were still a lot things left to do.
6234856	eng	Don't you think it would be romantic to do that?
6234857	eng	I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
6234858	eng	Tom said the woman I met yesterday was his mother.
6234859	eng	Don't you think it would be possible to do that?
6234860	eng	I don't think Tom would be hesitant to do that.
6234861	eng	Tom said that's not likely to happen anytime soon.
6234862	eng	Don't waste your time thinking about it anymore.
6234863	eng	I don't think Tom will be reluctant to do that.
6234864	eng	Tom said that wouldn't likely happen anytime soon.
6234865	eng	Doing that likely won't be all that interesting.
6234866	eng	I don't think Tom will be permitted to do that.
6234867	eng	Tom said that he wasn't working in Boston anymore.
6234868	eng	Doing that every morning must be boring for you.
6234869	eng	I don't think Tom will be motivated to do that.
6234870	eng	Tom said his father told him not to do that again.
6234871	eng	Do you really think it would be wise to do that?
6234872	eng	I don't think Tom really wants to do that here.
6234873	eng	Tom said he's really glad he was asked to do that.
6234874	eng	Do you really think it would be safe to do that?
6234875	eng	I don't think Tom is amused by what's going on.
6234876	eng	Tom said he's been having fun hanging out with us.
6234877	eng	Do you really think it would be easy to do that?
6234878	eng	I don't think Tom has to do that until October.
6234879	eng	Tom said he'd rather not go home until after 2:30.
6234880	eng	Do you really think doing that would be foolish?
6234881	eng	I don't think Tom has the willpower to do that.
6234882	eng	Tom said he'd like to do that as soon as possible.
6234883	eng	Do you get along with your brothers and sisters?
6234884	eng	I don't think Tom can find the time to do that.
6234885	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be willing to do that for us.
6234886	eng	Didn't you promise me that you wouldn't do that?
6234887	eng	I don't need to talk to Tom if I don't want to.
6234888	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be willing to do that for me.
6234889	eng	Didn't you know you weren't supposed to do that?
6234890	eng	I don't like the same kind of food as Tom does.
6234891	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to do that.
6234892	eng	Didn't you know that peanuts aren't really nuts?
6234893	eng	I don't like Tom and I don't think I ever will.
6234894	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't done that by himself.
6234895	eng	Didn't you know that I used to be a taxi driver?
6234896	eng	I don't know why Tom isn't supposed to do that.
6234897	eng	Tom said he watched TV for three hours last night.
6234898	eng	Didn't you know Mozart wrote a bassoon concerto?
6234899	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't want me to do that.
6234900	eng	Tom said he was the only one who got here on time.
6234901	eng	Didn't you know I don't have a driver's license?
6234902	eng	I don't know whether Tom should do that or not.
6234903	eng	Tom said he was still not very good at doing that.
6234904	eng	Didn't I tell you that you didn't need to worry?
6234905	eng	I don't know whether Tom has to do that or not.
6234906	eng	Tom said he was hoping you could do that with him.
6234907	eng	Are you thinking of going to Boston next summer?
6234908	eng	I don't know what time Tom got home last night.
6234909	eng	Tom said he wanted me to teach him how to do that.
6234910	eng	All you need to do is just sit there and listen.
6234911	eng	I don't have to talk to Tom if I don't want to.
6234912	eng	Tom said he thought it would be raining on Monday.
6234913	eng	All you have to do is just sit there and listen.
6234914	eng	I don't have to do that. Tom will do it for me.
6234915	eng	Tom said he thought it was a tad risky to do that.
6234916	eng	About how many hours did you watch TV last week?
6234917	eng	I don't have the courage to tell Tom the truth.
6234918	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that today.
6234919	eng	"Would you like some ice cream?" "No, thank you."
6234920	eng	I don't have the courage to ask Tom to do that.
6234921	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be dangerous.
6234922	eng	"How do you come to school?" "By bus and train."
6234923	eng	I don't have any money, so I can't go with Tom.
6234924	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be a mistake.
6234925	eng	"Do I have to do that?" "No, you don't have to."
6234926	eng	I don't ever want to go fishing with Tom again.
6234927	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would a lot of fun.
6234928	eng	You're the only person who can help me do that.
6234929	eng	I don't believe Tom really did that by himself.
6234930	eng	Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
6234931	eng	You're the only Canadian I've ever talked with.
6234932	eng	I didn't want to do that and Tom didn't either.
6234933	eng	Tom said he saw a lot of dead animals on the road.
6234934	eng	You're supposed to help me do that, aren't you?
6234935	eng	I didn't want Tom to leave, but he left anyway.
6234936	eng	Tom said he needed to do that as soon as possible.
6234937	eng	You'll have plenty of time to do that tomorrow.
6234938	eng	I didn't think Tom would have to do that again.
6234939	eng	Tom said he knew he might be permitted to do that.
6234940	eng	You'll do that later this afternoon, won't you?
6234941	eng	I didn't think Tom would be tempted to do that.
6234942	eng	Tom said he had already planned to do that for us.
6234943	eng	You'd be surprised if I did that, wouldn't you?
6234944	eng	I didn't think Tom would be nervous doing that.
6234945	eng	Tom said he doesn't know what he's supposed to do.
6234946	eng	You wouldn't like it if we did that, would you?
6234947	eng	I didn't think Tom would be frightened by that.
6234948	eng	Tom said he didn't want to give any more speeches.
6234949	eng	You won't be able to do that without some help.
6234950	eng	I didn't think Tom would be afraid, but he was.
6234951	eng	Tom said he didn't think doing that would be safe.
6234952	eng	You were the first one to do that, weren't you?
6234953	eng	I didn't think Tom was the last one to do that.
6234954	eng	Tom said he didn't have the confidence to do that.
6234955	eng	You were expecting this to happen, weren't you?
6234956	eng	I didn't think Tom was finished doing that yet.
6234957	eng	Tom said he didn't have enough money to buy a car.
6234958	eng	You used to be a school bus driver, didn't you?
6234959	eng	I didn't think Tom really had to do that today.
6234960	eng	Tom said he didn't believe that actually happened.
6234961	eng	You think you need to do that today, don't you?
6234962	eng	I didn't tell Tom I needed to find another job.
6234963	eng	Tom said he could probably do that in three hours.
6234964	eng	You think you have to do that today, don't you?
6234965	eng	I didn't know whether Tom could do that or not.
6234966	eng	Tom refused to tell me what he was planning to do.
6234967	eng	You think you don't need to do that, don't you?
6234968	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom told me that.
6234969	eng	Tom refused to do what I told him he needed to do.
6234970	eng	You think you don't have to do that, don't you?
6234971	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't going to do that.
6234972	eng	Tom promised me that he would never do that again.
6234973	eng	You still like to do that sometimes, don't you?
6234974	eng	I didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that.
6234975	eng	Tom probably thought I didn't know how to do that.
6234976	eng	You still have to finish doing that, don't you?
6234977	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to be so busy.
6234978	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who's going to help him.
6234979	eng	You still do that from time to time, don't you?
6234980	eng	I didn't know that Tom had already bought milk.
6234981	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what you're looking for.
6234982	eng	You should've been in Boston with us last week.
6234983	eng	I didn't know that Tom could understand French.
6234984	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what he should be doing.
6234985	eng	You should've been finished doing that by 2:30.
6234986	eng	I didn't know that Tom already knew what to do.
6234987	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that won't happen today.
6234988	eng	You should've been able to do that on your own.
6234989	eng	I didn't know how much money I should give Tom.
6234990	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to get a hold of me.
6234991	eng	You should've been able to do that much better.
6234992	eng	I didn't know how long Tom expected me to wait.
6234993	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he has to do that today.
6234994	eng	You should've been able to do that by yourself.
6234995	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to have to do that.
6234996	eng	Tom needs to start paying more attention in class.
6234997	eng	You should probably do that as soon as you can.
6234998	eng	I didn't know Tom wanted to do that by himself.
6234999	eng	Tom needs to be told about what's going to happen.
6235000	eng	You should be able to do that without any help.
6235001	eng	I didn't know Tom needed to do that by himself.
6235002	eng	Tom needed to be finished doing that by yesterday.
6235003	eng	You promised us that you'd never do that again.
6235004	eng	I didn't give Tom the information he requested.
6235005	eng	Tom moved to Boston with his wife just last month.
6235006	eng	You often go jogging in the morning, don't you?
6235007	eng	I didn't do that as well as Tom expected me to.
6235008	eng	Tom managed to get to school on time this morning.
6235009	eng	You never thought I'd want to do that, did you?
6235010	eng	How many times a week does Tom have to do that?
6235011	eng	Tom listed a lot of reasons why we should do that.
6235012	eng	You never really felt like doing that, did you?
6235013	eng	How many more days will it take Tom to do that?
6235014	eng	Tom knew he should've been able to do that better.
6235015	eng	You may need to stay in Boston a little longer.
6235016	eng	How many days has Tom already spent doing that?
6235017	eng	Tom isn't likely to be in Boston next Monday.
6235018	eng	You may have to stay in Boston a little longer.
6235019	eng	How long do you think Tom has spent doing that?
6235020	eng	Tom isn't likely to be determined to do that.
6235021	eng	You look like you've been sick for a long time.
6235023	eng	Tom isn't likely to be absent again tomorrow.
6235024	eng	You know we aren't going to do that, don't you?
6235025	eng	How badly was Tom's house damaged by the storm?
6235026	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what needs to be done.
6235027	eng	You know that I'm afraid to do that, don't you?
6235028	eng	Does that mean that Tom isn't going to do that?
6235029	eng	Tom is trying so hard to do what needs to be done.
6235030	eng	You know that I don't often do that, don't you?
6235031	eng	Do you think you could persuade Tom to do that?
6235032	eng	Tom is too conservative to do something like that.
6235033	eng	You know that I don't like it when you're late.
6235034	eng	Do you think Tom would be reluctant to do that?
6235035	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be eating.
6235036	eng	You know how much I hate doing that, don't you?
6235037	eng	Do you think Tom would be miserable doing that?
6235038	eng	Tom is out on the porch, talking with his friends.
6235039	eng	You knew I wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6235040	eng	Do you know Tom well enough to ask him to help?
6235041	eng	Tom is only trying to do what he's supposed to do.
6235042	eng	You knew I was supposed to do that, didn't you?
6235043	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to be there?
6235044	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who couldn't do that.
6235045	eng	You knew I was planning to do that, didn't you?
6235046	eng	Didn't you know Tom wasn't supposed to do that?
6235047	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were laid off.
6235048	eng	You haven't done that in a long time, have you?
6235049	eng	Didn't you know Tom is good at speaking French?
6235050	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were arrested.
6235051	eng	You don't want to try to do that again, do you?
6235052	eng	Didn't you know Tom couldn't play the trombone?
6235053	eng	Tom is likely to be very hungry when he gets home.
6235054	eng	You don't want to try doing that again, do you?
6235055	eng	Did you know that Tom isn't really from Boston?
6235056	eng	Tom is likely to be gone by the time we get there.
6235057	eng	You don't think that we should do that, do you?
6235058	eng	Did you know that Tom is also a French teacher?
6235059	eng	Tom is good at giving easy-to-follow instructions.
6235060	eng	You don't really understand how I feel, do you?
6235061	eng	Did you know Tom was still planning to do that?
6235062	eng	Tom is going to stay in Boston with us next month.
6235063	eng	You don't really need to do that today, do you?
6235064	eng	Did you know Tom lived with his aunt and uncle?
6235065	eng	Tom hopes that he doesn't have to do that anymore.
6235066	eng	You don't really have to do that today, do you?
6235067	eng	Did you know Tom is actually very conservative?
6235068	eng	Tom hasn't eaten or drunk anything for three days.
6235069	eng	You don't particularly want to do that, do you?
6235070	eng	Did you know Tom bought a house on Park Street?
6235071	eng	Tom has some things he needs to do this afternoon.
6235072	eng	You don't often do that in the morning, do you?
6235073	eng	Did you know Tom before he came to work for us?
6235074	eng	Tom has probably known about that for a long time.
6235075	eng	You don't know why I needed to do that, do you?
6235076	eng	Ask Tom if he really needs to be there by 2:30.
6235077	eng	Tom has enough money to buy that, I'm pretty sure.
6235078	eng	You don't have to help me if you don't want to.
6235079	eng	You're the only one who ever really liked Tom.
6235080	eng	Tom has chalk on his sleeve. Maybe he's a teacher.
6235081	eng	You don't expect me to do that for you, do you?
6235082	eng	You're the one Tom wants to take to the dance.
6235083	eng	Tom has been told that he doesn't need to do that.
6235084	eng	You didn't want to do that right away, did you?
6235085	eng	You'd better not do that while Tom's watching.
6235086	eng	Tom has been told that he doesn't have to do that.
6235087	eng	You didn't realize you had to do that, did you?
6235088	eng	You won't be able to stop Tom from doing that.
6235089	eng	Tom has been told he doesn't look like a teenager.
6235090	eng	You didn't know you needed to do that, did you?
6235091	eng	You weren't sure Tom should do that, were you?
6235092	eng	Tom has been on the baseball team for three years.
6235093	eng	You didn't have to do that right away, did you?
6235094	eng	You weren't sure Tom had to do that, were you?
6235095	eng	Tom has been living in Boston for three years now.
6235097	eng	You told Tom you couldn't do that, didn't you?
6235098	eng	Tom has been in Boston for almost three years now.
6235099	eng	You didn't have permission to do that, did you?
6235100	eng	You told Tom why I had to do that, didn't you?
6235101	eng	Tom has been having a really hard time doing that.
6235102	eng	You did that without anyone's help, didn't you?
6235103	eng	You told Tom why I didn't do that, didn't you?
6235104	eng	Tom has been giving us everything we've asked for.
6235105	eng	You did that in Boston last summer, didn't you?
6235106	eng	You told Tom not to do that again, didn't you?
6235107	eng	Tom has been doing that for less than three years.
6235108	eng	You actually tried to do that once, didn't you?
6235109	eng	You think Tom won't really do that, don't you?
6235111	eng	Would it be all right if I don't do that today?
6235112	eng	You think Tom won't likely do that, don't you?
6235113	eng	Tom finally learned to do that when he was thirty.
6235114	eng	When was the last time you were late for class?
6235115	eng	You think I could make Tom do that, don't you?
6235116	eng	Tom enjoys being home with his family on weekends.
6235117	eng	When do people start to get their wisdom teeth?
6235118	eng	You still want to do that with Tom, don't you?
6235119	eng	Tom doesn't want to be the one who has to do that.
6235120	eng	What makes you think I'd like to do that again?
6235121	eng	You still don't think Tom can do that, do you?
6235122	eng	Tom doesn't want to be present at today's meeting.
6235123	eng	What makes you think I'd be willing to do that?
6235124	eng	You still don't know why Tom did that, do you?
6235125	eng	Tom doesn't think he can find the time to do that.
6235126	eng	What makes you think I'd be tempted to do that?
6235127	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom that you did that.
6235128	eng	Tom doesn't think I'm going to be able to do that.
6235129	eng	What happened to the money I left on the table?
6235130	eng	You should've told Tom that he had to do that.
6235131	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be willing to do that anymore.
6235132	eng	We've decided to speak to each other in French.
6235133	eng	You should tell Tom you won't do that anymore.
6235134	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be enjoying himself very much.
6235135	eng	We'll probably be able to do that by ourselves.
6235136	eng	You should tell Tom you don't want to do that.
6235137	eng	Tom doesn't seem convinced that he has to do that.
6235138	eng	We stayed in Boston last year for three months.
6235139	eng	You should tell Tom you don't need to do that.
6235140	eng	Tom doesn't remember actually deciding to do that.
6235141	eng	We might not be in Boston until Monday evening.
6235142	eng	You should tell Tom you don't have to do that.
6235143	eng	Tom doesn't really think that I did that, does he?
6235144	eng	We don't need to hurry. We have plenty of time.
6235145	eng	You should tell Tom why you enjoyed doing that.
6235146	eng	Tom doesn't plan to do that until you tell him to.
6235147	eng	We don't come to Boston as often as we used to.
6235148	eng	You should tell Tom that he shouldn't do that.
6235149	eng	Tom doesn't make as much money as he says he does.
6235150	eng	There is a helipad on the roof of the hospital.
6235151	eng	You should make sure that Tom does that today.
6235152	eng	Tom doesn't know who's going to be at the meeting.
6235153	eng	There are a lot of unhappy people in the world.
6235154	eng	You should get Tom to tell you how to do that.
6235155	eng	Tom doesn't know whether he has to do that or not.
6235156	eng	The young girl carrying a flute seemed annoyed.
6235157	eng	You should get Tom to show you how to do that.
6235158	eng	Tom doesn't know whether I need to do that or not.
6235159	eng	The police chief said no arrests had been made.
6235160	eng	You should be able to do that better than Tom.
6235161	eng	Tom doesn't know whether I have to do that or not.
6235162	eng	The number of people who do that has increased.
6235163	eng	You need to ask Tom for permission to do that.
6235164	eng	Tom doesn't come to Boston as often as he used to.
6235165	eng	The last time I was in Boston was last October.
6235166	eng	You may be able to talk Tom out of doing that.
6235167	eng	Tom does things that I would never consider doing.
6235168	eng	The house I grew up in didn't have electricity.
6235169	eng	You know why Tom wanted to do that, don't you?
6235170	eng	Tom didn't tell me he didn't have time to do that.
6235171	eng	The car is all packed and we're ready to leave.
6235172	eng	You know that Tom wants to do that, don't you?
6235173	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware of what was happening.
6235174	eng	People might think you're crazy if you do that.
6235175	eng	You know that Tom needs to do that, don't you?
6235177	eng	My parents weren't the ones who taught me that.
6235178	eng	You hope Tom doesn't make us do that, don't you?
6235179	eng	Tom didn't seem concerned about what might happen.
6235180	eng	My name was spelled wrong in today's newspaper.
6235181	eng	You haven't told Tom why I did that, have you?
6235182	eng	Tom didn't look like he was in a hurry to do that.
6235183	eng	My mother made all my clothes when I was young.
6235184	eng	You have to ask Tom for permission to do that.
6235185	eng	Tom didn't like coffee the first time he tried it.
6235186	eng	My children can speak French better than I can.
6235187	eng	You don't want Tom to stop doing that, do you?
6235188	eng	Tom didn't know we were supposed to do that today.
6235189	eng	My assistant is a thirty-year-old Canadian man.
6235190	eng	You don't want Tom to do that anymore, do you?
6235191	eng	Tom didn't know that he had to do that by himself.
6235192	eng	Most people here don't know how to play tennis.
6235193	eng	You don't know why Tom has to do that, do you?
6235194	eng	Tom didn't have a dog the last time I visited him.
6235195	eng	Maybe I'll stay in Boston for a few more weeks.
6235196	eng	You don't know why Tom didn't do that, do you?
6235197	eng	Tom couldn't remember where he'd buried the money.
6235198	eng	Luckily, my guitar wasn't damaged in the flood.
6235199	eng	You didn't tell Tom I had to do that, did you?
6235200	eng	Tom couldn't remember where he had parked his car.
6235201	eng	Let's make sure that that doesn't happen again.
6235202	eng	You didn't know Tom wouldn't do that, did you?
6235203	eng	Tom could've stopped doing that if he'd wanted to.
6235204	eng	It's much more dangerous there than we thought.
6235205	eng	You didn't believe Tom would do that, did you?
6235206	eng	Tom could've been right, but I think he was wrong.
6235207	eng	It's already been a year since I last did that.
6235208	eng	You didn't believe Tom could do that, did you?
6235209	eng	Tom could've been intoxicated, but he acted sober.
6235210	eng	It'll take you at least three hours to do that.
6235211	eng	You asked Tom to help you do that, didn't you?
6235212	eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that I wouldn't do that.
6235213	eng	It'll take us several weeks to finish this job.
6235214	eng	You asked Tom not to do that here, didn't you?
6235215	eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that I couldn't do that.
6235216	eng	It'll probably be dangerous for you to do that.
6235217	eng	You asked Tom if he could do that, didn't you?
6235218	eng	Tom began doing that when he was living in Boston.
6235219	eng	It'll probably be almost impossible to do that.
6235220	eng	Would you know if Tom is permitted to do that?
6235221	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't show up for the meeting.
6235222	eng	It would be a good idea to do that by yourself.
6235223	eng	Will Tom really be able to do that by himself?
6235224	eng	Tom asked me to help him with his French homework.
6235225	eng	It took me about three hours to read this book.
6235226	eng	Why do you think Tom wouldn't want to do that?
6235227	eng	Tom asked if it would be dangerous if he did that.
6235228	eng	It takes a lot of money to do that, doesn't it?
6235229	eng	Why do you think Tom won't do that by himself?
6235230	eng	Tom and I were in the same French class last year.
6235231	eng	It probably won't be very expensive to do that.
6235232	eng	Why did you tell Tom I had trouble doing that?
6235233	eng	Tom and I used to talk to each other all the time.
6235234	eng	It must be boring for you to do that every day.
6235235	eng	Why did you tell Tom I didn't like doing that?
6235236	eng	Tom and I talked for quite a while this afternoon.
6235237	eng	It makes no difference whether you come or not.
6235238	eng	Why did you tell Tom I didn't have to do that?
6235239	eng	Tom and I swam together every morning last summer.
6235240	eng	It doesn't look like you're through doing that.
6235241	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't know how to do that?
6235242	eng	Tom and I sometimes speak to each other in French.
6235243	eng	It doesn't look like you're tempted to do that.
6235244	eng	Where do you think Tom will be this afternoon?
6235245	eng	Tom and I sat next to each other in the classroom.
6235246	eng	If you don't hurry, we won't get there on time.
6235247	eng	When did you find out Tom had moved to Boston?
6235248	eng	Tom and I often sit next to each other on the bus.
6235249	eng	If we had done that, it would've been more fun.
6235250	eng	What should we do while we're waiting for Tom?
6235251	eng	Tom and I never stay angry at each other for long.
6235252	eng	If I decide to come over, I'll give you a call.
6235253	eng	We should've been in Boston on Tom's birthday.
6235254	eng	Tom and I got married in a small church in Boston.
6235255	eng	I've decided not to go to Boston until October.
6235256	eng	We should take Tom to the hospital right away.
6235257	eng	Tom and I are studying for tomorrow's French test.
6235258	eng	I've decided it would be better not to do that.
6235259	eng	We need to make sure that Tom doesn't do that.
6235260	eng	Tom and I are going to climb Mt. Fuji next summer.
6235261	eng	I've been working as a plumber for three years.
6235262	eng	We have to make sure that Tom doesn't do that.
6235263	eng	Tom admitted he'd been doing that for a long time.
6235264	eng	I'm pretty good at French, but not good enough.
6235265	eng	This is the first time Tom has ever done this.
6235266	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
6235267	eng	I'm not supposed to do that this late at night.
6235268	eng	There's no chance that Tom will win the fight.
6235269	eng	Tom admitted he did what he wasn't supposed to do.
6235270	eng	I'm not afraid to do that, but some people are.
6235271	eng	The only one here who wants to do that is Tom.
6235272	eng	Tom, I understand that you've started doing that.
6235273	eng	I'd be very disappointed if you didn't do that.
6235274	eng	The only one here who needs to do that is Tom.
6235275	eng	Tom's teammates are glad he's able to play again.
6235276	eng	I went into the kitchen to get a cup of coffee.
6235277	eng	Tell Tom not to do that when we're not around.
6235278	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that if he didn't have to.
6235279	eng	I was told that we don't have to do that today.
6235280	eng	Should we tell Tom he doesn't have to do that?
6235281	eng	Tom would've done that if he'd had the chance to.
6235282	eng	I was never given the chance to try doing that.
6235283	eng	Please tell Tom that he's required to do that.
6235284	eng	Tom would never try to do that without some help.
6235285	eng	I wanted to go, but I had lots of things to do.
6235286	eng	Please tell Tom he has to do that before 2:30.
6235287	eng	Tom won't have to do anything he doesn't want to.
6235288	eng	I wanted to be the one who bought that for you.
6235289	eng	Please tell Tom I need to do that before 2:30.
6235290	eng	Tom won't be able to do that unless you help him.
6235291	eng	I want you to stay in Boston until next Monday.
6235292	eng	Please tell Tom I don't need to do that today.
6235293	eng	Tom will very likely have a good time doing that.
6235294	eng	I want to make sure you understand what I want.
6235295	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that.
6235296	eng	Tom will unlikely give you permission to do that.
6235297	eng	I want to know why you're not going to do that.
6235298	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know how to get to my place.
6235299	eng	Tom will probably be finished doing that by 2:30.
6235300	eng	I want to know whether you'll be ready by 2:30.
6235301	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's going to be fired.
6235302	eng	Tom will probably be difficult to get along with.
6235303	eng	I want to know how long we're going to be here.
6235304	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know exactly how to do that.
6235305	eng	Tom will live in Boston for at least three years.
6235306	eng	I want to get to Boston as quickly as possible.
6235307	eng	Let's do something special for Tom's birthday.
6235308	eng	Tom will likely be very hungry when he gets home.
6235309	eng	I want to buy that, but I don't have any money.
6235310	eng	Just make sure you tell Tom about the meeting.
6235311	eng	Tom will likely be gone by the time we get there.
6235312	eng	I want to be a police detective when I grow up.
6235313	eng	It's obvious that Tom doesn't want to do that.
6235314	eng	Tom was very vague about what he was going to do.
6235315	eng	I thought you'd be finished doing that by 2:30.
6235316	eng	It's obvious that Tom doesn't want to be here.
6235317	eng	Tom was the only other person who had to do that.
6235318	eng	I thought you'd be amused by what was going on.
6235319	eng	It's obvious that Tom doesn't like doing that.
6235320	eng	Tom was the only other person who didn't do that.
6235321	eng	I thought you wouldn't want to do that with me.
6235322	eng	It'll probably be possible for Tom to do that.
6235323	eng	Tom was the first person to ever ask me for help.
6235324	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to do that here.
6235325	eng	Is it true that Tom will be taking your place?
6235326	eng	Tom was never given the chance to try doing that.
6235327	eng	I thought you were told not to do that anymore.
6235328	eng	Is it necessary for Tom to do that by himself?
6235329	eng	Tom was in Boston visiting his parents last week.
6235330	eng	I thought you said you'd still like to do that.
6235331	eng	I've heard that Tom doesn't do that very much.
6235332	eng	Tom was carrying two suitcases, one in each hand.
6235333	eng	I thought you said you were willing to do that.
6235334	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it if you did that.
6235335	eng	Tom wanted to leave, but I persuaded him to stay.
6235336	eng	I thought you said you were tempted to do that.
6235337	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be reluctant to do that.
6235338	eng	Tom wanted me to give him enough time to do that.
6235339	eng	I thought you said someone told you to do that.
6235340	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be motivated to do that.
6235341	eng	Tom told me yesterday that he'd do that tomorrow.
6235342	eng	I thought that I wouldn't need to go to Boston.
6235343	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be the next one to do that.
6235344	eng	Tom told me that he didn't expect that to happen.
6235345	eng	I thought that I wouldn't have to go to Boston.
6235346	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be the last one to do that.
6235347	eng	Tom told me that I'm difficult to get along with.
6235348	eng	I thought I'd forgotten to close the windows.
6235349	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be finished doing that yet.
6235350	eng	Tom told me that I need to go to today's meeting.
6235351	eng	I thought I'd forgotten to tell you what to do.
6235352	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be excused from doing that.
6235353	eng	Tom told me that I need to be at today's meeting.
6235354	eng	I thought I'd be gone by the time you got here.
6235355	eng	I'm sure Tom will be interested in doing that.
6235356	eng	Tom told me he thought it would be OK to do that.
6235357	eng	I thought I heard some voices in the next room.
6235358	eng	I'm sure Tom is going to be cut from the team.
6235359	eng	Tom told his friends that he was going to Boston.
6235360	eng	I think that what you're suggesting won't work.
6235361	spa	Todos los amores son eternos. Lo único que cambia es la persona.
6235362	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be in Boston now.
6235363	eng	Tom threw rocks at the wolves to scare them away.
6235364	eng	I think it's probably not unethical to do that.
6235365	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom hasn't done that yet.
6235366	eng	Tom thought you were going to be able to do that.
6235367	eng	I think it's probably not expensive to do that.
6235368	eng	I'm not absolutely sure that's what Tom wants.
6235369	eng	Tom thought that the judge's decision was unfair.
6235370	eng	I think it's probably not dangerous to do that.
6235371	eng	I'm not absolutely sure that's what Tom needs.
6235372	eng	Tom thought he could do that if he had some help.
6235373	eng	I think it might not be interesting to do that.
6235374	eng	I'm going to meet Tom at the bus stop at 2:30.
6235375	eng	Tom thinks he's too important to do that himself.
6235376	eng	I think I'm the person you've been looking for.
6235377	eng	I'll make sure that Tom never does that again.
6235378	eng	Tom tells me that you're very good at doing that.
6235379	eng	I think I'll be able to do that this afternoon.
6235380	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if Tom didn't do that.
6235381	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he wants to do that.
6235382	eng	I still don't know what's going to happen next.
6235383	eng	I wonder if Tom is talented enough to do that.
6235384	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he needs to do that.
6235385	eng	I shouldn't have waited until today to do that.
6235386	eng	I won't likely tell Tom why I want to do that.
6235387	eng	Tom still hasn't done what we've asked him to do.
6235388	eng	I shouldn't have gone out after dark by myself.
6235389	eng	I won't likely tell Tom why I need to do that.
6235390	eng	Tom stayed in Boston with the rest of the family.
6235391	eng	I should be out of the hospital by next Monday.
6235392	eng	I won't likely tell Tom why I have to do that.
6235393	eng	Tom spent his thirtieth birthday in the hospital.
6235394	eng	I pretended I didn't know how to open the safe.
6235395	eng	I wish you hadn't told Tom I hated doing that.
6235396	eng	Tom spent a lot of time watching TV last weekend.
6235397	eng	I often get hungry about 2:30 in the afternoon.
6235398	eng	I wish that Tom would tell me where he's been.
6235399	eng	Tom spent a lot of time in the library on Monday.
6235400	eng	I need to stay in Boston for a few more nights.
6235401	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom wanted to do that.
6235402	eng	Tom spends most of his free time with his family.
6235403	eng	I looked under the table to see what was there.
6235404	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom needed to do that.
6235405	eng	Tom shouldn't have waited until today to do that.
6235406	eng	I looked around at all the boxes in the garage.
6235407	eng	I wasn't convinced that Tom wanted to do that.
6235408	eng	Tom should've hired a French-speaking babysitter.
6235409	eng	I know I shouldn't have tried doing that alone.
6235410	eng	I wasn't convinced that Tom needed to do that.
6235411	eng	Tom should've been gone by the time we got there.
6235412	eng	I just found out that you're going to be fired.
6235413	eng	I was hoping Tom would show me how to do that.
6235414	eng	Tom should be able to answer all those questions.
6235415	eng	I hope you don't expect me to buy that for you.
6235416	eng	I was going to take a nap, but Tom dropped by.
6235417	eng	Tom says this will be the last time he does this.
6235418	eng	I got back home earlier than I thought I would.
6235419	eng	I want to dye my hair the same color as Tom's.
6235420	eng	Tom says this will be the last time he does that.
6235421	eng	I found the sunglasses that I thought I'd lost.
6235422	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have time to do that.
6235423	eng	Tom says it doesn't matter to him if you do that.
6235424	eng	I don't want to talk about that over the phone.
6235425	eng	I told Tom I needed his help, so he helped me.
6235426	eng	Tom says he thinks it might be stupid to do that.
6235428	eng	I told Tom I couldn't remember his dog's name.
6235429	eng	Tom says he thinks he might be arrested tomorrow.
6235430	eng	I don't understand why I'm supposed to do that.
6235431	eng	I thought you were supposed to be helping Tom.
6235432	eng	Tom says he still remembers the time we did that.
6235433	eng	I don't think there's any risk of losing today.
6235434	eng	I thought you said you've seen Tom doing that.
6235435	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to sing with us anymore.
6235436	eng	I don't think it's possible for you to do that.
6235437	eng	I thought you said you were glad Tom did that.
6235438	eng	Tom says he doesn't intend to ever do that again.
6235439	eng	I don't think it would be expensive to do that.
6235440	eng	I thought the guy you were talking to was Tom.
6235441	eng	Tom sat there all afternoon, feeding the pigeons.
6235442	eng	I don't think it would be dangerous to do that.
6235443	eng	I thought Tom would be shocked, but he wasn't.
6235444	eng	Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
6235445	eng	I don't think I'll be the first one to do that.
6235446	eng	I thought Tom would be at home, but he wasn't.
6235447	eng	Tom said we weren't permitted to do that anymore.
6235448	eng	I don't think I'll be allowed to do that again.
6235449	eng	I thought Tom wasn't interested in doing that.
6235450	eng	Tom said we weren't allowed to swim here anymore.
6235451	eng	I don't think I need to do that until tomorrow.
6235452	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask you to do that.
6235453	eng	Tom said this will be the last time he does that.
6235454	eng	I don't think I have to do that until tomorrow.
6235455	eng	I thought Tom was glad that that had happened.
6235456	eng	Tom said the solution to the problem was obvious.
6235457	eng	I don't really want to deal with the situation.
6235458	eng	I thought Tom was difficult to get along with.
6235459	eng	Tom said that wasn't the real reason he did that.
6235460	eng	I don't make enough money to support my family.
6235461	eng	I thought Tom might need to do that this week.
6235462	eng	Tom said that he wasn't living in Boston anymore.
6235463	eng	I don't like to hang out with people who smoke.
6235464	eng	I thought Tom might have to do that this week.
6235465	eng	Tom said that he simply couldn't wait any longer.
6235466	eng	I don't know where I'm going to live next year.
6235467	eng	I thought Tom didn't know how to use a chain saw.
6235468	eng	Tom said last night's concert lasted three hours.
6235469	eng	I don't have my parents' permission to do that.
6235470	eng	I think you could get Tom to buy that for you.
6235471	eng	Tom said it wasn't the first time he'd done that.
6235472	eng	I don't have any friends who like to play golf.
6235473	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be happy if you did that.
6235474	eng	Tom said his company would likely offer me a job.
6235475	eng	I don't go to the movies as often as I used to.
6235476	eng	I think Tom would be interested in doing that.
6235477	eng	Tom said he's really glad he was able to do that.
6235478	eng	I don't go to the dentist as often as I should.
6235479	eng	I think Tom won't be the first one to do that.
6235480	eng	Tom said he's never been to a Chinese restaurant.
6235481	eng	I don't do that as well as I should be able to.
6235482	eng	I think Tom won't be interested in doing that.
6235483	eng	Tom said he's always been pretty good at singing.
6235484	eng	I don't allow my children to go out after dark.
6235485	eng	I think Tom won't be doing that before Monday.
6235486	eng	Tom said he'll do that for you if you ask him to.
6235487	eng	I didn't wear a suit to my graduation ceremony.
6235488	eng	I think Tom won't be at home tomorrow morning.
6235489	eng	Tom said he'd help me do that if I wanted him to.
6235490	eng	I didn't want to write about what had happened.
6235491	eng	I think Tom will probably know how to do that.
6235492	eng	Tom said he wouldn't have enough time to do that.
6235493	eng	I didn't want to take over the family business.
6235494	eng	I think Tom will be unenthusiastic about that.
6235495	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be allowed to do that again.
6235496	eng	I didn't want to know what was going to happen.
6235497	eng	I think Tom will be through doing that by now.
6235498	eng	Tom said he wished he'd eaten more for breakfast.
6235499	eng	I didn't want to be the one who had to do that.
6235500	eng	I think Tom will be surprised if that happens.
6235501	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't spent so much money.
6235502	eng	I didn't think you'd be doing that for so long.
6235503	eng	I think Tom will be doing that this afternoon.
6235504	eng	Tom said he was too short to reach the top shelf.
6235505	eng	I didn't think you'd be doing that by yourself.
6235506	eng	I think Tom will be amused by what's going on.
6235507	eng	Tom said he was hoping we could do that together.
6235508	eng	I didn't think doing that would be so much fun.
6235509	eng	I think Tom will be able to help us next week.
6235510	eng	Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
6235511	eng	I didn't think doing that would be a good idea.
6235512	eng	I think Tom was the one who stole your bicycle.
6235513	eng	Tom said he thought you wouldn't want to do that.
6235514	eng	I didn't think I'd have enough time to do that.
6235515	eng	I think Tom may visit Boston on his next trip.
6235516	eng	Tom said he thought we'd need to wait until 2:30.
6235517	eng	I didn't think I'd ever get used to this smell.
6235518	eng	I think Tom is the only one who can't do that.
6235519	eng	Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape.
6235520	eng	I didn't think I'd ever get used to this noise.
6235521	eng	I think I know why Tom didn't want to do that.
6235522	eng	Tom said he thought that would likely not happen.
6235523	eng	I didn't think I'd ever get used to doing that.
6235524	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I had to do that.
6235525	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy doing that.
6235526	eng	I didn't think I'd be the first one to do that.
6235527	eng	I should probably tell Tom what I need to buy.
6235528	eng	Tom said he thought he might not need to do that.
6235529	eng	I didn't think I would have to do that anymore.
6235530	eng	I should probably tell Tom to stop doing that.
6235531	eng	Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
6235532	eng	I didn't tell anyone what I was planning to do.
6235533	eng	I should probably tell Tom to quit doing that.
6235534	eng	Tom said he needs to do that as soon as possible.
6235535	eng	I didn't stick around to see what would happen.
6235536	eng	I should probably not tell Tom that I'm tired.
6235537	eng	Tom said he knew he might be required to do that.
6235538	eng	I didn't start playing the mandolin until 2013.
6235539	eng	I should do that the way Tom told me to do it.
6235540	eng	Tom said he just wanted to buy something cheaper.
6235541	eng	I didn't really like my job. That's why I quit.
6235542	eng	I said that I didn't want to do that with Tom.
6235543	eng	Tom said he hopes that happens before he retires.
6235544	eng	I didn't like coffee the first time I tried it.
6235545	eng	I promised Tom that I'd go to Boston with him.
6235546	eng	Tom said he expected us do the same thing he did.
6235547	eng	I didn't know that you needed to do that today.
6235548	eng	I never told Tom I didn't know how to do that.
6235549	eng	Tom said he didn't want to watch TV this evening.
6235550	eng	I didn't know that you could understand French.
6235551	eng	I know that you and Tom will do that together.
6235552	eng	Tom said he didn't think we should be doing that.
6235553	eng	I didn't know that we were supposed to do that.
6235554	eng	I knew Tom wouldn't likely be able to do that.
6235555	eng	Tom said he didn't think he had to do that today.
6235556	eng	I didn't know if I'd be able to do that or not.
6235557	eng	I knew Tom wasn't going to be able to do that.
6235558	eng	Tom said he didn't have anything he needed to do.
6235559	eng	I didn't know how to do what needed to be done.
6235560	eng	I found some old coins in the box Tom gave me.
6235561	eng	Tom said he didn't do what he was supposed to do.
6235562	eng	I didn't know how to do that until last spring.
6235563	eng	I forgot to remind Tom that he had to do that.
6235564	eng	Tom said he did that, but he didn't really do it.
6235565	eng	I didn't have enough time, so I didn't do that.
6235566	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be upset.
6235567	eng	Tom said he could do that, but he wasn't able to.
6235568	eng	I didn't have enough strength to open the door.
6235569	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be ready.
6235570	eng	Tom said he assumed you wouldn't want to do that.
6235571	eng	I didn't commit the crime I've been accused of.
6235572	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be early.
6235573	eng	Tom said doing that shouldn't take too much time.
6235574	eng	I didn't anticipate that it would be a problem.
6235575	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be awake.
6235576	eng	Tom said I should've asked him to do that for me.
6235577	eng	I did that yesterday, so I don't have to today.
6235578	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be alone.
6235579	eng	Tom quit studying French after just three months.
6235580	eng	I did that for more than three hours yesterday.
6235581	eng	I doubt that Tom will be fired for doing that.
6235582	eng	Tom promised himself he wouldn't do that anymore.
6235583	eng	I did that a lot better than I thought I would.
6235584	eng	I doubt that Tom will be fined for doing that.
6235585	eng	Tom probably won't do that again until next year.
6235586	eng	I did that a lot better than I thought I could.
6235587	eng	I doubt if Tom will be through doing that yet.
6235588	eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that on his own.
6235589	eng	I can't sing very well and neither can my wife.
6235590	eng	I don't think that Tom looks like his brother.
6235591	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why you didn't do that.
6235592	eng	I can't remember exactly where I parked my car.
6235593	eng	I don't think Tom would be tempted to do that.
6235594	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who's going to do that.
6235595	eng	I can't play the dulcimer as well as I used to.
6235596	eng	I don't think Tom would be nervous doing that.
6235597	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to get to my place.
6235598	eng	I can understand why you don't want to do that.
6235599	eng	I don't think Tom would be frightened by that.
6235600	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's going to be fired.
6235601	eng	I came here as soon as I heard you needed help.
6235602	eng	I don't think Tom will be hesitant to do that.
6235603	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly how to do that.
6235604	eng	How old were you when you first went to Boston?
6235605	eng	I don't think Tom wanted to do that yesterday.
6235606	eng	Tom probably doesn't have the ability to do that.
6235607	eng	How much time do you think you need to do that?
6235608	eng	I don't think Tom really knows how to do that.
6235609	eng	Tom probably doesn't have enough time to do that.
6235610	eng	How much longer to you think I need to do this?
6235611	eng	I don't think Tom really has to do that again.
6235612	eng	Tom probably did that just to get some attention.
6235613	eng	How many times do you laugh in an ordinary day?
6235614	eng	I don't think Tom is interested in doing that.
6235615	eng	Tom poured two cups of coffee and gave one to me.
6235616	eng	How many times did you go swimming last summer?
6235617	eng	I don't think Tom is in his office on Mondays.
6235618	eng	Tom often puts honey in his tea instead of sugar.
6235619	eng	How many more hours do you plan to study today?
6235620	eng	I don't think Tom is going to do that anymore.
6235621	eng	Tom never returned the money he borrowed from me.
6235622	eng	How many months does it really take to do that?
6235623	eng	I don't think Tom can stop me from doing that.
6235624	eng	Tom looked like he wasn't in a hurry to get home.
6235625	eng	How many days will it actually take to do that?
6235626	eng	I don't think I really had to do that for Tom.
6235627	eng	Tom left here thirty minutes before you got here.
6235628	eng	How many days does it actually take to do that?
6235629	eng	I don't really expect Tom to come to my party.
6235630	eng	Tom knows he shouldn't try doing that by himself.
6235631	eng	How many books do you think you read last year?
6235632	eng	I don't need to know why Tom wants to do that.
6235633	eng	Tom knew that he'd be able to do that eventually.
6235634	eng	How long would you recommend we stay in Boston?
6235635	eng	I don't know why Tom shouldn't have done that.
6235636	eng	Tom knew he might not need to do that by himself.
6235637	eng	How do you think we should handle this problem?
6235638	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't come to the party.
6235639	eng	Tom knew he might not have to do that by himself.
6235640	eng	How did you know what to do when that happened?
6235641	eng	I don't know whether Tom is having fun or not.
6235642	eng	Tom isn't yet quite sure what he should be doing.
6235643	eng	Even if you don't want to do that, you need to.
6235644	eng	I don't know whether Tom is a Canadian or not.
6235645	eng	Tom isn't willing to do that unless you help him.
6235646	eng	Even if you don't want to do that, you have to.
6235647	eng	I don't know whether Tom can sing well or not.
6235648	eng	Tom isn't very likely to be fired for doing that.
6235649	eng	Don't you think it would be foolish to do that?
6235650	eng	I don't know whether Tom can cook well or not.
6235651	eng	Tom isn't very likely be arrested for doing that.
6235652	eng	Don't forget to remind me to renew my passport.
6235653	eng	I don't know where Tom learned how to do that.
6235654	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knows what's going on.
6235655	eng	Doing that will be a lot easier than you think.
6235656	eng	I don't know where Tom has been all afternoon.
6235657	eng	Tom isn't likely to be reluctant to do that.
6235658	eng	Do you want to take a walk before going to bed?
6235659	eng	I don't know what to buy Tom for his birthday.
6235660	eng	Tom isn't likely to be motivated to do that.
6235661	eng	Do you really think it's impossible to do that?
6235662	eng	I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
6235663	eng	Tom isn't likely to be desperate to do that.
6235664	eng	Do you really think it's depressing to do that?
6235665	eng	I don't know how to deal with people like Tom.
6235666	eng	Tom is the same friendly person he's always been.
6235667	eng	Do you really think doing that would be stupid?
6235668	eng	I don't go to the movies as often as Tom does.
6235669	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to know what to do.
6235670	eng	Didn't you know you were likely to be arrested?
6235671	eng	I didn't wear the shirt Tom wanted me to wear.
6235672	eng	Tom is the only one who knows what we need to do.
6235673	eng	Didn't you know you could walk there from here?
6235674	eng	I didn't want you to tell Tom about the party.
6235675	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be tired.
6235676	eng	Did you read comic books when you were a child?
6235677	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom about what happened.
6235678	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be happy.
6235679	eng	Could you please dig this hole a little deeper?
6235680	eng	I didn't want Tom to help me with my homework.
6235681	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't have an umbrella.
6235682	eng	Can't you stay in Boston until at least Monday?
6235683	eng	I didn't think Tom's idea was a very good one.
6235684	eng	Tom is the only one who didn't volunteer to help.
6235685	eng	Can I stay in Boston for a couple more days?
6235686	eng	I didn't think Tom would be drunk, but he was.
6235687	eng	Tom is still too young to get a driver's license.
6235688	eng	As I told you before, I can't help you do that.
6235689	eng	I didn't think Tom would be busy this morning.
6235690	eng	Tom is staying in a motel not very far from here.
6235691	eng	Are you tired of people telling you what to do?
6235692	eng	I didn't think Tom really knew how to do that.
6235693	eng	Tom is someone I have trouble getting along with.
6235694	eng	Are you really thinking about moving to Boston?
6235695	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I wanted him to do that.
6235696	eng	Tom is probably waiting for you in the lobby now.
6235697	eng	All three of Mary's ex-husbands live in Boston.
6235698	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I couldn't eat peanuts.
6235699	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who need to do that.
6235700	eng	About how many minutes will it take to do that?
6235701	eng	I didn't tell Tom I'd never done that before.
6235702	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who have to do that.
6235703	eng	About how many minutes does it take to do that?
6235704	eng	I didn't remember to send Tom a birthday card.
6235705	eng	Tom is one of the thirty people who were injured.
6235706	eng	A majority of the people here can speak French.
6235707	eng	I didn't really think Tom did that by himself.
6235708	eng	Tom is much smarter than most people think he is.
6235709	eng	"How do you get to school?" "By bus and train."
6235710	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was swimming or not.
6235711	eng	Tom is lucky to still be excused from doing that.
6235712	eng	Your parents would never allow you to do that.
6235713	eng	I didn't know that Tom would be at your party.
6235714	eng	Tom is lucky that so many people have helped him.
6235715	eng	You're the only person I've ever really hated.
6235716	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't able to do that.
6235717	eng	Tom is in his third season as the team's manager.
6235718	eng	You're the only person I know who can do that.
6235719	eng	I didn't know that Tom was interested in jazz.
6235720	eng	Tom inherited a grand piano from his grandfather.
6235721	eng	You're the only one who's supposed to do that.
6235722	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to Australia.
6235723	eng	Tom hasn't lost as much weight as he says he has.
6235724	eng	You're the only one who's not able to do that.
6235725	eng	I didn't know that Tom used to be a policeman.
6235726	eng	Tom hasn't been seen in public since he resigned.
6235727	eng	You're the only one who knows how to fix that.
6235728	eng	I didn't know that Tom expected me to do that.
6235729	eng	Tom hasn't been doing that as often as he should.
6235730	eng	You're still a resident of Boston, aren't you?
6235731	eng	I didn't know Tom was living with your family.
6235732	eng	Tom has worked as a bartender since last October.
6235733	eng	You're not the only one who's able to do that.
6235734	eng	I didn't know Tom wanted to do that yesterday.
6235735	eng	Tom has told me he has to go to Boston next week.
6235736	eng	You're not supposed to be doing that, are you?
6235737	eng	I didn't know Tom thought I shouldn't do that.
6235739	eng	You're likely the only person who can do that.
6235740	eng	I didn't know Tom needed to do that yesterday.
6235741	eng	Tom has raised three million dollars for charity.
6235742	eng	You're feeling a lot better today, aren't you?
6235743	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't have time to do that.
6235744	eng	Tom has managed to do everything he needed to do.
6235745	eng	You'll likely lose some weight if you do that.
6235746	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom, but I'm glad I did.
6235747	eng	Tom has borrowed a lot of money from his friends.
6235748	eng	You'll go to the hospital tomorrow, won't you?
6235749	eng	I didn't have the heart to tell Tom the truth.
6235750	eng	Tom has been getting into trouble a lot recently.
6235751	eng	You'd probably be able to do that by yourself.
6235752	eng	I didn't expect to hear back from Tom so soon.
6235753	eng	Tom has been doing that for the last three years.
6235754	eng	You wouldn't like it if I did that, would you?
6235755	eng	I didn't even try to pretend that I liked Tom.
6235756	eng	Tom has been doing that for at least three years.
6235757	eng	You won't be able to do that without our help.
6235758	eng	I didn't believe Tom when he said he loved me.
6235759	eng	Tom has an upset stomach because he ate too much.
6235760	eng	You were tricked into doing that, weren't you?
6235761	eng	I did that as soon as Tom told me I needed to.
6235762	eng	Tom has advised me not to start doing that again.
6235763	eng	You were the last one to do that, weren't you?
6235764	eng	I couldn't find the money that Tom had hidden.
6235765	eng	Tom hardly ever goes to places like that anymore.
6235766	eng	You were supposed to have done that yesterday.
6235767	eng	I can't remember what Tom told me I should do.
6235768	eng	Tom got up an hour later than usual this morning.
6235769	eng	You were excused from doing that, weren't you?
6235770	eng	I can't remember what Tom told me I had to do.
6235771	eng	Tom got his first chance to do that this morning.
6235772	eng	You thought that we could do that, didn't you?
6235773	eng	I can't do that, and Tom can't do that either.
6235774	eng	Tom got a little drunk and became very talkative.
6235775	eng	You thought I'd refuse to do that, didn't you?
6235776	eng	I asked Tom why he did that the way he did it.
6235777	eng	Tom expects to be finished doing that in October.
6235778	eng	You thought I'd already done that, didn't you?
6235779	eng	I always thought Tom would eventually do that.
6235780	eng	Tom drinks two or three cups of coffee every day.
6235781	eng	You thought I knew how to do that, didn't you?
6235782	eng	How many times do you think Tom has done that?
6235783	eng	Tom doesn't yet know I'm not very happy about it.
6235784	eng	You think I really have to do that, don't you?
6235785	eng	How did you talk Tom into buying that for you?
6235786	eng	Tom doesn't think you'll be permitted to do that.
6235787	eng	You still do that whenever you can, don't you?
6235788	eng	How did you know Tom was going to be arrested?
6235789	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that is a good idea.
6235790	eng	You should stay in Boston for a few more days.
6235791	eng	Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
6235792	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what he's talking about.
6235793	eng	You should go to Boston and visit your family.
6235794	eng	Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to be here.
6235795	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be amused by what's going on.
6235796	eng	You should be able to do that without my help.
6235797	eng	Everyone knew that Tom didn't like doing that.
6235798	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be afraid to do that anymore.
6235799	eng	You seemed convinced that I needed to do that.
6235800	eng	Does Tom think it's safe to cross this bridge?
6235801	eng	Tom doesn't really think we can do that, does he?
6235802	eng	You seem to be keeping yourself in good shape.
6235803	eng	Does Tom still do that as often as he used to?
6235804	eng	Tom doesn't really think he can do that, does he?
6235805	eng	You really should've gone to Boston last week.
6235806	eng	Does Tom still come to Boston every Christmas?
6235807	eng	Tom doesn't know why he's getting another chance.
6235808	eng	You overheard what we were saying, didn't you?
6235809	eng	Do you want me to get Tom to buy that for you?
6235810	eng	Tom doesn't know who can sing well and who can't.
6235811	eng	You must be able to speak French for this job.
6235812	eng	Do you want me to ask Tom to buy that for you?
6235813	eng	Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to park there.
6235814	eng	You look like you're too tired to do anything.
6235815	eng	Do you think Tom would be hesitant to do that?
6235816	eng	Tom doesn't have very much money, but he gets by.
6235817	eng	You know that I've never done that, don't you?
6235818	eng	Do you think Tom will be permitted to do that?
6235819	eng	Tom doesn't have very much experience doing that.
6235820	eng	You knew I didn't need to do that, didn't you?
6235821	eng	Do you mean you didn't really see Tom do that?
6235822	eng	Tom doesn't have those kinds of problems anymore.
6235823	eng	You knew I didn't have to do that, didn't you?
6235824	eng	Do you know the reason why Tom was doing that?
6235825	eng	Tom didn't want to think about what might happen.
6235826	eng	You hope you don't need to do that, don't you?
6235827	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was living in Boston?
6235828	eng	Tom didn't want to do that, but he had no choice.
6235829	eng	You haven't had a chance to do that, have you?
6235830	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to do that?
6235831	eng	Tom didn't want me to help him with his homework.
6235832	eng	You haven't finished doing that yet, have you?
6235833	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to be here?
6235834	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who he needed to talk to.
6235835	eng	You haven't done that yet this year, have you?
6235836	eng	Didn't you know that Tom spent time in prison?
6235837	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware of what was going on.
6235838	eng	You haven't done that as many times as I have.
6235839	eng	Didn't you know Tom would want you to do that?
6235840	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he had to do.
6235841	eng	You haven't actually ever done that, have you?
6235842	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still studying French?
6235843	eng	Tom didn't seem convinced that he had to do that.
6235844	eng	You had a dog when you were a kid, didn't you?
6235845	eng	Didn't you know Tom was living on Park Street?
6235846	eng	Tom didn't like sushi the first time he tried it.
6235847	eng	You don't think that I should do that, do you?
6235848	eng	Didn't you know Tom was in Boston last winter?
6235849	eng	Tom didn't learn how to do that from his parents.
6235851	eng	Didn't you know Tom was good at playing chess?
6235852	eng	Tom didn't know that what he'd done wasn't legal.
6235853	eng	You don't think I should've done that, do you?
6235854	eng	Didn't you know Tom doesn't have any brothers?
6235855	eng	Tom didn't know that we were supposed to do that.
6235856	eng	You don't really think we can do that, do you?
6235857	eng	Did you know that Tom would be here this week?
6235858	eng	Tom didn't know that he had to do that yesterday.
6235859	eng	You don't really feel like doing that, do you?
6235860	eng	Did you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
6235861	eng	Tom didn't know how long he was supposed to wait.
6235862	eng	You don't need to do that anymore, do you?
6235863	eng	Did you know that Tom was planning to do that?
6235864	eng	Tom didn't know he was supposed to do that today.
6235865	eng	You don't need to go there unless you want to.
6235866	eng	Did you know that Tom was in Boston last year?
6235867	eng	Tom didn't have to do that, but he did it anyway.
6235868	eng	You don't need to do that by yourself, do you?
6235869	eng	Ask Tom if he knows how to operate a forklift.
6235870	eng	Tom didn't do that as well as I thought he would.
6235871	eng	You don't know who's going to do that, do you?
6235872	eng	A lot of people criticized Tom for doing that.
6235873	eng	Tom did that for three hours yesterday afternoon.
6235874	eng	You don't know when I need to do that, do you?
6235875	eng	"Will you meet Tom tomorrow?" "Yes, I plan to."
6235876	eng	Tom decided it would be too difficult to do that.
6235877	eng	You don't have you to do that anymore, do you?
6235878	eng	You've asked Tom not to do that, haven't you?
6235879	eng	Tom couldn't read or write until he was thirteen.
6235880	eng	You don't have to do that by yourself, do you?
6235881	eng	You're the only one who ever really knew Tom.
6235882	eng	Tom could be prejudiced, but I don't think he is.
6235883	eng	You don't have to do that again today, do you?
6235884	eng	You're the one who got Tom drunk, aren't you?
6235885	eng	Tom came over just as I was about to do that.
6235886	eng	You don't do that now as often as you used to.
6235887	eng	You're not going to let Tom do that, are you?
6235888	eng	Tom called me to tell me that he has a flat tire.
6235889	eng	You do that every Monday afternoon, don't you?
6235890	eng	You're not expecting Tom to do that, are you?
6235891	eng	Tom began playing the drums when he was thirteen.
6235892	eng	You didn't think I needed to do that, did you?
6235893	eng	You'll never let Tom do that again, will you?
6235894	eng	Tom assured me that he would never do that again.
6235895	eng	You didn't know that I could do that, did you?
6235896	eng	You'll do that if Tom asks you to, won't you?
6235897	eng	Tom asked me if any of my sisters were unmarried.
6235898	eng	You didn't have to do that yesterday, did you?
6235899	eng	You'd never permit Tom to do that, would you?
6235900	eng	Tom asked if he really had to do that by himself.
6235902	eng	You were the one who inspired Tom to do that.
6235903	eng	Tom apparently has to study French at his school.
6235904	eng	You didn't actually do that yourself, did you?
6235905	eng	You warned Tom you might do that, didn't you?
6235906	eng	Tom apparently had to study French at his school.
6235907	eng	You did that in Boston last month, didn't you?
6235908	eng	You told Tom he couldn't do that, didn't you?
6235909	eng	Tom and his friends are outside, waiting for you.
6235910	eng	You agreed that we should do that, didn't you?
6235911	eng	You thought Tom ought to do that, didn't you?
6235912	eng	Tom and I'll wait for you in front of the school.
6235913	eng	When was the last time you were out on a date?
6235914	eng	You think Tom isn't going do that, don't you?
6235915	eng	Tom and I'll probably never see each other again.
6235916	eng	What made you think I was finished doing that?
6235917	eng	You think I could get Tom do that, don't you?
6235918	eng	Tom and I won't play study together this evening.
6235919	eng	We're fortunate that we're allowed to do that.
6235920	eng	You should've told Tom why he had to do that.
6235921	eng	Tom and I went outside to see what was happening.
6235922	eng	We used to go to Boston at least once a month.
6235923	eng	You should've given Tom more time to do that.
6235924	eng	Tom and I plan to spend Valentine's Day together.
6235925	eng	We should leave this area as soon as possible.
6235926	eng	You should tell Tom that you have to do that.
6235927	eng	Tom and I live across the street from each other.
6235928	eng	We should get out of here as soon as possible.
6235929	eng	You should tell Tom that he ought to do that.
6235930	eng	Tom and I even often wear the same color clothes.
6235931	eng	We might stay in Boston for a couple of weeks.
6235932	eng	You should tell Tom that he needs to do that.
6235933	eng	Tom and I entered the classroom at the same time.
6235934	eng	We may need to stay in Boston for a few weeks.
6235935	eng	You should let Tom know that you can do that.
6235936	eng	Tom and I couldn't agree on what we needed to do.
6235937	eng	We may need to live in Boston for a few years.
6235938	eng	You should ask Tom for permission to do that.
6235939	eng	Tom and I both don't remember where we first met.
6235940	eng	We may have to stay in Boston for a few weeks.
6235941	eng	You seemed to be surprised when Tom did that.
6235942	eng	Tom and I are getting ready to do that right now.
6235943	eng	We may have to live in Boston for a few years.
6235944	eng	You seemed convinced that Tom had to do that.
6235945	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what he promised to do.
6235946	eng	We may have to be in Boston for a week or two.
6235947	eng	You seem convinced that Tom wants to do that.
6235948	eng	Tom's French has improved a lot since last year.
6235949	eng	We lived in Chicago before we moved to Boston.
6235950	eng	You seem convinced that Tom needs to do that.
6235951	eng	Tom would probably be happy to buy that for you.
6235952	eng	We have permission to build thirty new houses.
6235953	eng	You saw Tom doing that yesterday, didn't you?
6235954	eng	Tom would be disappointed if he saw you do that.
6235955	eng	We always get a lot of snow this time of year.
6235956	eng	You know why Tom wants to do that, don't you?
6235957	eng	Tom wondered how much time he'd have to do that.
6235958	eng	We always get a lot of rain this time of year.
6235959	eng	You knew that Tom was doing that, didn't you?
6235960	eng	Tom won't likely give you permission to do that.
6235961	eng	Unfortunately, I was stupid enough to do that.
6235962	eng	You knew Tom would be doing that, didn't you?
6235963	eng	Tom won't likely be present at Monday's meeting.
6235964	eng	This morning's meeting was shorter than usual.
6235965	eng	You don't want Tom to do that for me, do you?
6235966	eng	Tom won't likely be finished doing that by 2:30.
6235967	eng	They say it gets very cold here in the winter.
6235968	eng	You don't think Tom wants to do that, do you?
6235969	eng	Tom won't likely be difficult to get along with.
6235970	eng	There's something I have to talk to you about.
6235971	eng	You don't think Tom ought to do that, do you?
6235972	eng	Tom won't likely be confused about that anymore.
6235973	eng	There's no way I'm going to do that by myself.
6235974	eng	You don't think Tom needs to do that, do you?
6235975	eng	Tom won't likely be awake at this time of night.
6235976	eng	There are a few magazines on the coffee table.
6235977	eng	You don't think Tom meant to do that, do you?
6235978	eng	Tom won't let his children speak French at home.
6235979	eng	The beach is always crowded this time of year.
6235980	eng	You don't think Tom is going do that, do you?
6235981	eng	Tom will probably to be excused from doing that.
6235982	eng	Please check to see if there are any mistakes.
6235983	eng	You don't really want Tom to do that, do you?
6235984	eng	Tom will probably be through doing that by 2:30.
6235985	eng	No one wants to do that, but one of us has to.
6235986	eng	You don't really care what Tom wants, do you?
6235987	eng	Tom will probably be present at today's meeting.
6235988	eng	My truck was slightly damaged in the accident.
6235989	eng	You don't like the way Tom does that, do you?
6235990	eng	Tom will probably be exhausted after doing that.
6235991	eng	My last name was Jackson before I got married.
6235992	eng	You don't like it when Tom does that, do you?
6235993	eng	Tom wasn't the first one to get up this morning.
6235994	eng	My family has a summer house in the mountains.
6235995	eng	You don't know why Tom is doing that, do you?
6235996	eng	Tom wasn't taller than me when we were thirteen.
6235997	eng	Just thinking about doing that makes me tired.
6235998	eng	You didn't want to help Tom do that, did you?
6235999	eng	Tom wasn't able to think of a good hiding place.
6236000	eng	It's important to do that every day, isn't it?
6236001	eng	You didn't want to do that with Tom, did you?
6236002	eng	Tom was the only other person who could do that.
6236003	eng	It'll take you at least three days to do that.
6236004	eng	You did that the way Tom told you to, I hope.
6236005	eng	Tom was the one who showed me how to copy files.
6236006	eng	It'll take me at least three hours to do that.
6236007	eng	You did that just to impress Tom, didn't you?
6236008	eng	Tom was the manager of our team three years ago.
6236009	eng	It'll take a lot of time to finish doing that.
6236010	eng	You asked Tom why he'd done that, didn't you?
6236011	eng	Tom was the last person who lived in this house.
6236012	eng	It'll probably be possible for you to do that.
6236013	eng	You asked Tom to stop doing that, didn't you?
6236014	eng	Tom was in his mid thirties when he got married.
6236015	eng	It wouldn't be any trouble to do that for you.
6236016	eng	You asked Tom to do that quietly, didn't you?
6236017	eng	Tom was happy that someone wanted his old piano.
6236018	eng	It would be very unfortunate if that happened.
6236019	eng	You asked Tom to do that for you, didn't you?
6236020	eng	Tom wants to know what we expect to happen next.
6236021	eng	It would be unethical for me to tell you that.
6236022	eng	You and Tom will do that together, won't you?
6236023	eng	Tom walked across the room to open the curtains.
6236024	eng	It would be ridiculous to do that by yourself.
6236025	eng	You and I are the only people Tom knows here.
6236026	eng	Tom told us that it wasn't necessary to do that.
6236027	eng	It would be impossible to do that by yourself.
6236028	eng	You already know why Tom did that, don't you?
6236029	eng	Tom told me why he wanted me to do that for him.
6236030	eng	It would be great if you could do that for me.
6236031	eng	You agreed to ask Tom to do that, didn't you?
6236032	eng	Tom told me there was no need for me to do that.
6236033	eng	It would be depressing to do that by yourself.
6236034	eng	Would you be good enough to buy that for Tom?
6236035	eng	Tom told me that he's unenthusiastic about that.
6236036	eng	It won't be easy to do that without some help.
6236037	eng	Would it be OK if Tom did that instead of me?
6236038	eng	Tom told me that he's troubled by what happened.
6236039	eng	It looked like you were just about to do that.
6236040	eng	Would Tom still be willing to do that for us?
6236041	eng	Tom told me that he's grateful for all our help.
6236042	eng	Is it OK if I stay in Boston for another week?
6236043	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't be able to do that?
6236044	eng	Tom told me that he'll be in Boston next Monday.
6236045	eng	If you try, I think you'll be able to do that.
6236046	eng	Who told you Tom wasn't going to be arrested?
6236047	eng	Tom thought he might need to do that by himself.
6236048	eng	If you don't do that, it'll cause me problems.
6236049	eng	When was it that you went to Boston with Tom?
6236050	eng	Tom thought he might have to do that by himself.
6236051	eng	If you aren't busy, perhaps you could help me.
6236052	eng	When did you find out Tom had been in prison?
6236053	eng	Tom thinks that doing that would be a good idea.
6236054	eng	I've lived in Boston for the past three years.
6236055	eng	When did you decide to permit Tom to do that?
6236056	eng	Tom surrendered himself to the police on Monday.
6236057	eng	I've decided to stay here for a few more days.
6236058	eng	Was it you who told Tom he shouldn't do that?
6236059	eng	Tom studied French for three hours this morning.
6236060	eng	I've decided not to live in Boston any longer.
6236061	eng	Was it you who told Tom he needed to do that?
6236062	eng	Tom still has a lot to do before he can go home.
6236063	eng	I've been told we're not allowed to park here.
6236064	eng	Three of Tom's friends are already in prison.
6236065	eng	Tom still doesn't know what he's supposed to do.
6236066	eng	I'm the only person here who can speak French.
6236067	eng	There's no way Tom did that without any help.
6236068	eng	Tom started to go insane after his parents died.
6236069	eng	I'm the only one who knows what we have to do.
6236070	eng	There's no way I'm going to do that with Tom.
6236071	eng	Tom started screaming, so the children ran away.
6236072	eng	I'm sure I won't be allowed to do that either.
6236073	eng	There's no chance that Tom will ever do that.
6236074	eng	Tom sleeps as if she had never done that before.
6236075	eng	I'm sure I won't be able to do that by myself.
6236076	eng	The reason Tom went to Boston was to do that.
6236077	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that without permission.
6236078	eng	I'm supposed to do that at least once a month.
6236079	eng	The only one here that's able to do that is Tom.
6236080	eng	Tom should've been very hungry when he got home.
6236081	eng	I'm pretty sure banks will be closed tomorrow.
6236082	eng	That was the first time I helped Tom do that.
6236083	eng	Tom should've been amused by what was happening.
6236084	eng	I'm pretty happy with the progress we've made.
6236085	eng	Please tell Tom that he needs to work harder.
6236086	eng	Tom should be able to do that without your help.
6236087	eng	I'm not the only one who knows how to do that.
6236088	eng	Please tell Tom that I don't need to do that.
6236089	eng	Tom seems to have trouble controlling his anger.
6236090	eng	I'm not the only one who didn't pass the test.
6236091	eng	Please find out when Tom wants us to do that.
6236092	eng	Tom seemed to have a hard time making ends meet.
6236093	eng	I'm glad I stayed in Boston for a week longer.
6236094	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what he did was wrong.
6236095	eng	Tom seemed satisfied with the answer I gave him.
6236096	eng	I'm a lot smarter than most people think I am.
6236097	eng	It was yesterday that Tom started to do that.
6236098	eng	Tom says you don't want to go to Boston with us.
6236099	eng	I'll try not to take up too much of your time.
6236100	eng	It takes a lot of courage to do what Tom did.
6236101	eng	Tom says he thought he could do that by himself.
6236102	eng	I'd rather not visit Boston during the winter.
6236103	eng	It sounds like Tom might not want to do that.
6236104	eng	Tom says he never feels like doing that anymore.
6236105	eng	I'd rather do that now while it's still light.
6236106	eng	It sounds like Tom might not need to do that.
6236107	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he could ever do that.
6236108	eng	I'd like to see you before I leave for Boston.
6236109	eng	It sounds like Tom might not have to do that.
6236110	eng	Tom says he doesn't really feel like doing that.
6236111	eng	I'd like to do that with you today, but can't.
6236112	eng	It looks like Tom isn't very good at dancing.
6236113	eng	Tom says he doesn't have the courage to do that.
6236114	eng	I'd go camping with you if my leg didn't hurt.
6236115	eng	Is it true that Tom was the one who did that?
6236116	eng	Tom says he doesn't care whether we stay or not.
6236117	eng	I'd be very grateful if you'd help me do that.
6236118	eng	Is Tom the only one who knows how to do that?
6236119	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe you really did that.
6236120	eng	I'd be very disappointed if I saw you do that.
6236121	eng	I'm the only person who can help Tom do that.
6236122	eng	Tom says he doesn't feel like doing that right now.
6236123	eng	I wouldn't want to do anything that's illegal.
6236124	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be hesitant to do that.
6236125	eng	Tom said we shouldn't leave until after sunrise.
6236126	eng	I wouldn't have done that if I didn't have to.
6236127	eng	I'm sure Tom will be organized. He always is.
6236128	eng	Tom said three million dollars had been donated.
6236129	eng	I wonder if it's against the rules to do that.
6236130	eng	I'm not going to permit Tom to do that again.
6236131	eng	Tom said that was the first time he'd done that.
6236132	eng	I wish you would do that early in the morning.
6236133	eng	I wonder if Tom will be reluctant to do that.
6236134	eng	Tom said that just doing that isn't good enough.
6236135	eng	I wish we'd stayed in Boston for another week.
6236136	eng	I wish that I could spend more time with Tom.
6236137	eng	Tom said that he wasn't studying French anymore.
6236138	eng	I wish that I could spend more time in Boston.
6236139	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom about what I'd done.
6236140	eng	Tom said that he thought Boston was a safe city.
6236141	eng	I wish I'd remembered to buy flowers for Mary.
6236142	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to stop doing that.
6236143	eng	Tom said that he had a lot of fun at your party.
6236144	eng	I wish I were better at playing the saxophone.
6236145	eng	I went to the same kindergarten that Tom did.
6236146	eng	Tom said it wasn't the first time that happened.
6236147	eng	I wish I were able to visit Boston more often.
6236148	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom not to do that.
6236149	eng	Tom said it was more difficult than he expected.
6236150	eng	I wish I could stay in Boston a little longer.
6236151	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom how to do that.
6236152	eng	Tom said it felt good to get outside in the sun.
6236153	eng	I wasn't surprised that you needed to do that.
6236154	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom couldn't do that.
6236155	eng	Tom said he's ready to do whatever is necessary.
6236156	eng	I was surprised that I didn't need to do that.
6236157	eng	I was in love with Tom when I was a teenager.
6236158	eng	Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
6236159	eng	I was surprised that I didn't have to do that.
6236160	eng	I was impressed by the how well Tom did that.
6236161	eng	Tom said he's been waiting for over three hours.
6236162	eng	I wanted to stay home yesterday, but I didn't.
6236163	eng	I wanted to do that, but Tom wouldn't let me.
6236164	eng	Tom said he's been asked not to do that anymore.
6236165	eng	I wanted to go to Boston and live with my dad.
6236166	eng	I want to spend the rest of my life with Tom.
6236167	eng	Tom said he's always been pretty good at sports.
6236168	eng	I wanted to do that yesterday, but I couldn't.
6236169	eng	I want to know where Tom went to high school.
6236170	eng	Tom said he'd help me figure out how to do that.
6236171	eng	I want to sell everything that's in my garage.
6236172	eng	I want to finish eating before Tom gets here.
6236173	eng	Tom said he'd do that for you if you asked him to.
6236174	eng	I want to move out and find a place of my own.
6236175	eng	I understand why Tom doesn't want to do that.
6236176	eng	Tom said he'd do that for me if I wanted him to.
6236177	eng	I want to make sure that doesn't happen to me.
6236178	eng	I tried to convince Tom not to do that again.
6236179	eng	Tom said he'd be going back to Boston on Monday.
6236180	eng	I want to know if you have a driver's license.
6236181	eng	I told Tom that I wanted to meet his parents.
6236182	eng	Tom said he'd be able to do that this afternoon.
6236183	eng	I want to get a tattoo of a dragon on my back.
6236184	eng	I told Tom that I don't have time to do that.
6236185	eng	Tom said he wished you wouldn't do that anymore.
6236186	eng	I want to ask you some questions about French.
6236187	eng	I told Tom that I didn't remember doing that.
6236188	eng	Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
6236189	eng	I tried to stay awake, but I soon fell asleep.
6236190	eng	I told Tom that I didn't need to do anything.
6236191	eng	Tom said he wasn't permitted to do that anymore.
6236192	eng	I thought you'd be through doing that by 2:30.
6236193	eng	I told Tom that I didn't know how to do that.
6236194	eng	Tom said he was too old to go mountain climbing.
6236195	eng	I thought you'd be outside on a day like this.
6236196	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have to do anything.
6236197	eng	Tom said he was the only one who had to do that.
6236198	eng	I thought you were going to do that yesterday.
6236199	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have anything to do.
6236200	eng	Tom said he wanted to be an electrical engineer.
6236201	eng	I thought you said you've seen people do that.
6236202	eng	I told Tom I thought he was wasting his time.
6236203	eng	Tom said he thought he would be able to do that.
6236204	eng	I thought you said you've only done that once.
6236205	eng	I thought Tom would be doing that by himself.
6236206	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what had to be done.
6236207	eng	I thought you said you were glad you did that.
6236208	eng	I thought Tom would be awake when I got home.
6236209	eng	Tom said he thought he could do that by himself.
6236210	eng	I thought you said you were afraid to do that.
6236211	eng	I thought Tom was present at today's meeting.
6236212	eng	Tom said he thought doing that wouldn't be safe.
6236213	eng	I thought you didn't know how to speak French.
6236214	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask us to do that.
6236215	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't be busy on Monday.
6236216	eng	I think you'll be able to do that by yourself.
6236217	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask me to do that.
6236218	eng	Tom said he might go to Boston in a week or two.
6236219	eng	I think that what you've suggested won't work.
6236220	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be reluctant to do that.
6236221	eng	Tom said he may stay in Boston for a few months.
6236222	eng	I think it's probably not possible to do that.
6236223	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be motivated to do that.
6236224	eng	Tom said he learned how to do that the hard way.
6236225	eng	I think I didn't make a good first impression.
6236226	eng	I think Tom would be forgiven if he did that.
6236227	eng	Tom said he knew he might be allowed to do that.
6236228	eng	I think I can do both things at the same time.
6236229	eng	I think Tom would be forgiven for doing that.
6236230	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be able to do that today.
6236231	eng	I still have a lot to do before I can go home.
6236232	eng	I think Tom would be excused from doing that.
6236233	eng	Tom said he hoped he could learn how to do that.
6236234	eng	I stayed in Boston for three months last year.
6236235	eng	I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
6236236	eng	Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop that.
6236237	eng	I shouldn't have done that without permission.
6236238	eng	I think Tom won't be the next one to do that.
6236239	eng	Tom said he doesn't have enough time to do that.
6236240	eng	I should've stayed in Boston for another week.
6236241	eng	I think Tom won't be the last one to do that.
6236242	eng	Tom said he didn't want to study French anymore.
6236243	eng	I should've handled the situation differently.
6236244	eng	I think Tom won't be doing that anytime soon.
6236245	eng	Tom said he didn't want to sing with us anymore.
6236246	eng	I should be doing the same thing you're doing.
6236247	eng	I think Tom will have a hard time doing that.
6236248	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help weed the garden.
6236249	eng	I should be able to help you tomorrow morning.
6236250	eng	I think Tom will be the first one to do that.
6236251	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go to Boston with me.
6236252	eng	I should be able to do that without your help.
6236253	eng	I think Tom will be interested in doing that.
6236254	eng	Tom said he didn't want to force you to do that.
6236255	eng	I should be able to change the tire by myself.
6236256	eng	I think Tom is the only Canadian on our team.
6236257	eng	Tom said he didn't think that actually happened.
6236258	eng	I regret that I can't help you in this matter.
6236259	eng	I think Tom is sure that's what he has to do.
6236260	eng	Tom said he didn't think he should say anything.
6236261	eng	I realize I don't have enough time to do that.
6236262	eng	I think Tom is coming to Boston next weekend.
6236263	eng	Tom said he didn't believe that really happened.
6236264	eng	I pretended I didn't know anything about that.
6236265	eng	I think Tom could've been tempted to do that.
6236267	eng	I made the mistake of trying to do that alone.
6236268	eng	I think Tom could be just the person we need.
6236269	eng	Tom said I wasn't good enough to be on the team.
6236270	eng	I looked around to see if anyone was watching.
6236271	eng	I think I'm not supposed to help Tom do that.
6236272	eng	Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
6236273	eng	I looked around the room to see who was there.
6236274	eng	I still haven't told Tom why I won't do that.
6236275	eng	Tom really would've enjoyed doing that with you.
6236276	eng	I know this won't be the last time we do this.
6236277	eng	I should've known better than to believe Tom.
6236278	eng	Tom really needs to do that as soon as possible.
6236279	eng	I hope you don't get suspended for doing that.
6236280	eng	I should've done that the way Tom told me to.
6236281	eng	Tom promised that that would never happen again.
6236282	eng	I hope you don't expect me to do that for you.
6236283	eng	I should wait until Tom gets here to do that.
6236284	eng	Tom promised that he wouldn't lie to me anymore.
6236285	eng	I hope you can understand why I won't do that.
6236286	eng	I should tell Tom that I want him to do that.
6236287	eng	Tom promised me that that'll never happen again.
6236288	eng	I have to go to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6236289	eng	I should tell Tom I want to find another job.
6236290	eng	Tom probably should do that as soon as possible.
6236291	eng	I have a candle, but I don't have any matches.
6236292	eng	I should probably tell Tom what he has to do.
6236293	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what he did was wrong.
6236294	eng	I had to do that even though I didn't want to.
6236295	eng	I should probably tell Tom what I want to do.
6236296	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I'm not Canadian.
6236297	eng	I had some free time yesterday, so I did that.
6236298	eng	I should probably tell Tom what I need to do.
6236299	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I don't like him.
6236300	eng	I guess I'm never going to be able to do that.
6236301	eng	I should probably tell Tom what I have to do.
6236302	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how he should do that.
6236303	eng	I got back home sooner than I thought I would.
6236304	eng	I should probably tell Tom to do that for me.
6236305	eng	Tom probably doesn't know exactly what happened.
6236306	eng	I gained a lot of weight when I was in Boston.
6236307	eng	I should probably tell Tom I want to do that.
6236308	eng	Tom probably doesn't know anything about Boston.
6236309	eng	I don't want to take over the family business.
6236310	eng	I should probably tell Tom I need to do that.
6236311	eng	Tom probably doesn't know a lot about Australia.
6236312	eng	I don't want to do this, but I have no choice.
6236313	eng	I should probably tell Tom I have to do that.
6236314	eng	Tom probably doesn't have time to do that today.
6236315	eng	I don't want to be the one who has to do that.
6236316	eng	I never thought Tom would be able to do that.
6236317	eng	Tom plans to start doing that as soon as he can.
6236318	eng	I don't want anyone in my room while I'm away.
6236319	eng	I need to make sure that Tom doesn't do that.
6236320	eng	Tom looked like he wasn't in a hurry to do that.
6236321	eng	I don't think you'll have much fun doing that.
6236322	eng	I might speak French with Tom when I see him.
6236323	eng	Tom knows a lot about wild animals in this area.
6236324	eng	I don't think it's ethical for you to do that.
6236325	eng	I looked around the room, but didn't see Tom.
6236326	eng	Tom isn't very likely to go to camp this summer.
6236327	eng	I don't think it would be possible to do that.
6236328	eng	I like the same kind of stuff that Tom likes.
6236329	eng	Tom isn't very likely to be there for very long.
6236330	eng	I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.
6236331	eng	I knew Tom would likely not agree to do that.
6236332	eng	Tom isn't likely to be hungry when he gets here.
6236333	eng	I don't think I'll be the next one to do that.
6236334	eng	I knew Tom would be arrested sooner or later.
6236335	eng	Tom isn't likely to be sensible about that.
6236336	eng	I don't think I'll be the last one to do that.
6236337	eng	I knew Tom might not want to do that anymore.
6236338	eng	Tom isn't likely to be hesitant to do that.
6236339	eng	I don't think I'll be awake when you get home.
6236340	eng	I hope that Tom will teach me how to do that.
6236341	eng	Tom isn't going to be very happy if you do that.
6236342	eng	I don't think I'd have the courage to do that.
6236343	eng	I hope Tom isn't irritated by all this noise.
6236344	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what we ought to do.
6236345	eng	I don't think I'd ever want to live in Boston.
6236346	eng	I hope Tom isn't difficult to get along with.
6236347	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what he needs to do.
6236348	eng	I don't think I'd be interested in doing that.
6236349	eng	I hope Tom helps me with my homework tonight.
6236350	eng	Tom is trying to earn as much money as possible.
6236351	eng	I don't think I have the willpower to do that.
6236352	eng	I hope Tom doesn't go to Boston next weekend.
6236353	eng	Tom is too diplomatic to do something like that.
6236354	eng	I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
6236355	eng	I haven't yet told Tom why I need to do that.
6236356	eng	Tom is the only person I would trust to do that.
6236357	eng	I don't really have time to do that right now.
6236358	eng	I finally managed to persuade Tom to do that.
6236359	eng	Tom is the only person I know who can't do that.
6236360	eng	I don't need to go to Boston until next month.
6236361	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will do that.
6236362	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem to be busy.
6236363	eng	I don't like the way my mother braids my hair.
6236364	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be home.
6236365	eng	Tom is the only one who didn't come here by car.
6236366	eng	I don't like riding my motorcycle in the rain.
6236367	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be here.
6236368	eng	Tom is the kind of person who likes a challenge.
6236369	eng	I don't let people I don't know into my house.
6236370	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be cold.
6236371	eng	Tom is staying in a motel not too far from here.
6236372	eng	I don't know why I wasn't supposed to do that.
6236373	eng	I doubt if Tom will be up this late at night.
6236374	eng	Tom is probably not going to do that by himself.
6236375	eng	I don't know who's going to be at the meeting.
6236376	eng	I doubt if Tom will be in Boston this summer.
6236377	eng	Tom is probably not going to be able to do that.
6236378	eng	I don't know whether I have to do that or not.
6236379	eng	I doubt if Tom will be in Boston next Monday.
6236380	eng	Tom is one person I never want to talk to again.
6236381	eng	I don't know if I have enough time to do that.
6236382	eng	I don't want you to tell Tom about the party.
6236383	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who had to do that.
6236384	eng	I don't know how to eat sushi with chopsticks.
6236385	eng	I don't want to tell Tom about what happened.
6236386	eng	Tom is much richer than most people think he is.
6236387	eng	I don't know how much time we have to do that.
6236388	eng	I don't want Tom to help me with my homework.
6236389	eng	Tom is likely to still be determined to do that.
6236390	eng	I don't know how much money I'm going to need.
6236391	eng	I don't understand why Tom shouldn't do that.
6236392	eng	Tom is likely to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6236393	eng	I don't know anyone who might want to do that.
6236394	eng	I don't think Tom would permit me to do that.
6236395	eng	Tom is likely to be difficult to get along with.
6236396	eng	I don't have to go to Boston until next month.
6236397	eng	I don't think Tom would care if you did that.
6236398	eng	Tom is going to be very sorry he didn't do that.
6236399	eng	I don't have time to go jogging every morning.
6236400	eng	I don't think Tom would be afraid to do that.
6236401	eng	Tom is fortunate that he's permitted to do that.
6236402	eng	I don't have time right now to talk to anyone.
6236403	eng	I don't think Tom will be tempted to do that.
6236404	eng	Tom is certainly supposed to be able to do that.
6236405	eng	I don't have enough time to do that right now.
6236406	eng	I don't think Tom will be nervous doing that.
6236407	eng	Tom is by far the smartest student in our class.
6236408	eng	I don't have enough money to pay all my bills.
6236409	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that with me.
6236410	eng	Tom hopes that he doesn't have to do that again.
6236411	eng	I don't enjoy doing that as much as I used to.
6236412	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that anymore.
6236413	eng	Tom hasn't come to French class for three weeks.
6236414	eng	I don't earn enough money to support a family.
6236415	eng	I don't think Tom will be careless this time.
6236416	eng	Tom has two daughters. Both of them are married.
6236417	eng	I don't care what you're going to do tomorrow.
6236418	eng	I don't think Tom will be at today's meeting.
6236419	eng	Tom has to start doing that as soon as possible.
6236420	eng	I don't care what kind of music you listen to.
6236421	eng	I don't think Tom will be allowed to do that.
6236422	eng	Tom has the same kind of computer that you have.
6236423	eng	I didn't want to talk about what had happened.
6236424	eng	I don't think Tom really did that by himself.
6236425	eng	Tom has the courage to do that, I'm pretty sure.
6236426	eng	I didn't want to spend as much money as I did.
6236427	eng	I don't think Tom is finished doing that yet.
6236428	eng	Tom has studied French for at least three years.
6236429	eng	I didn't want to do this, but I had no choice.
6236430	eng	I don't think Tom is able to do that anymore.
6236431	eng	Tom has promised that he'll never be late again.
6236432	eng	I didn't think that anyone would recognize me.
6236433	eng	I don't think Tom has the stamina to do that.
6236434	eng	Tom has known how to do that since he was three.
6236435	eng	I didn't think I'd get bored, but I was wrong.
6236436	eng	I don't think Tom has the courage to do that.
6236437	eng	Tom has decided to leave early tomorrow morning.
6236438	eng	I didn't think I'd be the last one to do that.
6236439	eng	I don't think Tom has the ability to do that.
6236440	eng	Tom has decided he's the one who should do that.
6236441	eng	I didn't tell the police officer my real name.
6236442	eng	I don't think Tom has enough time to do that.
6236443	eng	Tom has been told that he's required to do that.
6236444	eng	I didn't tell anyone why I had gone to Boston.
6236445	eng	I don't think Tom ever gets anywhere on time.
6236446	eng	Tom has been speaking French since he was a kid.
6236447	eng	I didn't speak French well enough for the job.
6236448	eng	I don't think Tom ever considered doing that.

6236450	eng	I didn't really feel like eating Chinese food.
6236451	eng	I don't really think Tom did that by himself.
6236452	eng	Tom has an ex-wife and three children in Boston.
6236453	eng	I didn't realize I had my shirt on inside out.
6236454	eng	I don't need to tell Tom about what happened.
6236455	eng	Tom has already told me I don't need to do that.
6236456	eng	I didn't learn how to do that from my parents.
6236457	eng	I don't like broccoli and Tom doesn't either.
6236458	eng	Tom has already told me I don't have to do that.
6236459	eng	I didn't know you weren't supposed to do that.
6236460	eng	I don't know why Tom was supposed to do that.
6236461	eng	Tom has already asked the police for protection.
6236462	eng	I didn't know you used to be a French teacher.
6236463	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't like my friends.
6236464	eng	Tom got up much earlier than usual this morning.
6236465	eng	I didn't know whether I had to do that or not.
6236466	eng	I don't know whether Tom will do that or not.
6236467	eng	Tom finally managed to buy everything he needed.
6236468	eng	I didn't know where the fire extinguisher was.
6236469	eng	I don't know where Tom usually goes swimming.
6236470	eng	Tom explained why it was a good idea to do that.
6236471	eng	I didn't know that you were going to be there.
6236472	eng	I don't know where Tom usually goes shopping.

6236475	eng	I don't know what Tom wants to eat for lunch.
6236476	eng	Tom doesn't want to be the first one to do that.
6236477	eng	I didn't know that you didn't want to do that.
6236478	eng	I don't know what I did to make Tom so angry.
6236479	eng	Tom doesn't think they're capable of doing that.
6236480	eng	I didn't know that what I'd done wasn't legal.
6236481	eng	I don't know how well Tom can play the drums.

6236483	eng	I didn't know that what I was doing was wrong.
6236484	eng	I don't have to tell Tom about what happened.

6236487	eng	I don't believe a word of what Tom just said.
6236488	eng	Tom doesn't think that doing that is a bad idea.
6236489	eng	I didn't know that I had to do that yesterday.
6236490	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom how much I weighed.
6236491	eng	Tom doesn't think he'll ever be able to do that.
6236492	eng	I didn't know that I had to do that by myself.
6236493	eng	I didn't think the jokes Tom told were funny.
6236494	eng	Tom doesn't think he'll be permitted to do that.

6236505	eng	I didn't think Tom would allow us to do that.

6236525	eng	I didn't have much time to finish my homework.
6236526	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I intended to do that.

6236564	eng	I can't figure out how to get the window open.
6236565	eng	I didn't know that Tom had already done that.

6236579	eng	I almost always do that right after breakfast.
6236580	eng	I didn't know Tom was your significant other.
6236581	eng	Tom claims he was beaten while he was in prison.
6236582	eng	How many weeks does it really take to do that?

6236594	eng	How did you know what to do in that situation?
6236595	eng	I didn't feel I should do what Tom was doing.
6236596	eng	Tom assured me that he wouldn't do that anymore.
6236597	eng	Even if you don't want to do that, you should.
6236598	eng	I didn't expect such a nice present from Tom.
6236599	eng	Tom asked me to give him enough time to do that.
6236600	eng	Don't you think it would be unsafe to do that?
6236601	eng	I can still remember the day I first met Tom.
6236602	eng	Tom and his neighbors don't get along very well.
6236603	eng	Don't you think it would be tiring to do that?
6236604	eng	I advise you to do that before Tom gets here.
6236605	eng	Tom and I went out for dinner yesterday evening.
6236606	eng	Don't you think it would be stupid to do that?
6236607	eng	How many minutes will it take Tom to do that?

6236617	eng	Tom and I moved into our new house last weekend.
6236618	eng	Do you really think it's enjoyable to do that?
6236619	eng	How are we going to keep Tom from doing that?
6236620	eng	Tom and I like to sit on the porch after dinner.
6236621	eng	Do you really think it's dangerous to do that?
6236622	eng	Do you want me to get Tom to do that for you?
6236623	eng	Tom and I got married in Boston three years ago.
6236624	eng	Do you really think doing that would be wrong?
6236625	eng	Do you think Tom would likely do that for us?
6236626	eng	Tom and I gave each other presents on Christmas.
6236627	eng	Do you really think doing that would be smart?
6236628	eng	Do you think Tom would be obliged to do that?
6236629	eng	Tom and I couldn't agree on where we should eat.
6236630	eng	Do you really think doing that would be silly?
6236631	eng	Do you think Tom would be nervous doing that?
6236632	eng	Tom and I couldn't agree on what should be done.
6236633	eng	Do you really think doing that would be risky?
6236634	eng	Do you still see Tom as often as you used to?
6236635	eng	Tom and I are still waiting for you to get here.
6236636	eng	Do you have a pair of scissors I could borrow?
6236637	eng	Do you know the reason why Tom is doing that?
6236638	eng	Tom always seems to have a lot of math homework.
6236639	eng	Do you get along well with your mother-in-law?
6236640	eng	Do you have any idea what Tom is going to do?
6236641	eng	Tom admitted he did what we asked him not to do.
6236642	eng	Didn't you know that I used to live in Boston?
6236643	eng	Didn't you suspect that Tom was lying to you?
6236644	eng	Tom admitted he did what he said he wouldn't do.
6236645	eng	Did your whole family come to Boston with you?
6236646	eng	Didn't you know that Tom is a French teacher?
6236647	eng	Tom admits he's been doing that for a long time.
6236648	eng	Can you tell me exactly what needs to be done?
6236649	eng	Didn't you know Tom wasn't going to be there?
6236650	eng	Tom's house is on the other side of the street.
6236651	eng	As I told you before, I don't want to do that.
6236652	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to enjoy doing that?
6236653	eng	Tom's brother didn't make it out alive, either.
6236654	eng	Aren't you the one who volunteered to do that?
6236655	eng	Didn't you know Tom owns more than one house?
6236656	eng	Tom wouldn't have let his own children do that.
6236657	eng	Are you really thinking about getting married?
6236658	eng	Didn't you know Tom had spent time in prison?
6236659	eng	Tom would probably be happy to do that for you.
6236660	eng	Are we supposed to stop at a railway crossing?
6236661	eng	Didn't you know Tom doesn't have any sisters?
6236662	eng	Tom would probably be able to buy that for you.
6236663	eng	Am I the only one who doesn't want to do that?
6236664	eng	Didn't you know Tom and I used to be married?
6236665	eng	Tom would be very disappointed if you did that.
6236666	eng	Am I the only one who doesn't need to do that?
6236667	eng	Did you know that Tom didn't want to do that?
6236668	eng	Tom wondered who in the room understood French.
6236669	eng	Am I the only one who doesn't have to do that?
6236670	eng	Did you know that Tom almost never does that?
6236671	eng	Tom won't likely be outside on a day like this.
6236672	eng	About how many hours do you do that every day?
6236673	eng	Did you know Tom was going to propose to you?
6236674	eng	Tom won't likely be impressed with this report.
6236675	eng	A wise person wouldn't do something like that.
6236676	eng	Did you know Tom used to be a French teacher?
6236677	eng	Tom won't likely be as careful as he should be.
6236678	eng	"How do you go to school?" "By bus and train."
6236679	eng	Apparently, Tom was on television last night.
6236680	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without your help.
6236681	eng	You've already tried doing that, haven't you?
6236682	eng	All three of Tom's brothers can speak French.
6236683	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without some help.
6236684	eng	You're the only one who knows how to do that.
6236685	eng	About how many times a week does Tom do that?
6236686	eng	Tom will unlikely have to do that anytime soon.
6236687	eng	You're the only one who didn't pass the test.
6236688	eng	A judge had ordered Tom to leave the country.
6236689	eng	Tom will probably get punished if he does that.
6236690	eng	You're a lot smarter now than you used to be.
6236691	eng	"Whose car is that over there?" "It's Tom's."
6236692	eng	Tom will probably get arrested if he does that.
6236693	eng	You're a graduate of the same school as I am.
6236694	eng	"Who's that gentleman?" "That's Tom Jackson."
6236695	eng	Tom will probably be unenthusiastic about that.
6236696	eng	You'll do that as soon as you can, won't you?
6236697	eng	You're the one who convinced Tom to do that.
6236698	eng	Tom will probably be through doing that by now.
6236699	eng	You'd like me to do that, too, wouldn't you?
6236700	eng	You're not suggesting Tom did that, are you?
6236701	eng	Tom will probably be starved when he gets home.
6236702	eng	You wouldn't care if I did that, would you?
6236703	eng	You'll do that with Tom tomorrow, won't you?
6236704	eng	Tom will probably be impressed by what you did.
6236705	eng	You won't be able to see anything from there.
6236706	eng	You'll ask Tom to do that for us, won't you?
6236707	eng	Tom will probably be amused by what's going on.
6236708	eng	You won't be able to do that without my help.
6236709	eng	You'd never allow Tom to do that, would you?
6236710	eng	Tom will likely give you permission to do that.
6236711	eng	You were embarrassed to do that, weren't you?
6236712	eng	You were quicker at doing that than Tom was.
6236713	eng	Tom will likely be finished doing that by 2:30.
6236714	eng	You used to do that every Monday, didn't you?
6236715	eng	You tried to get Tom to do that, didn't you?
6236716	eng	Tom will likely be difficult to get along with.
6236717	eng	You used to do that all the time, didn't you?
6236718	eng	You tricked Tom into doing that, didn't you?
6236719	eng	Tom will be intoxicated by the time you arrive.
6236720	eng	You used to be a history teacher, didn't you?
6236721	eng	You told Tom that you'd do that, didn't you?
6236722	eng	Tom will be here for at least three more years.
6236723	eng	You think I really had to do that, don't you?
6236724	eng	You told Tom I wouldn't do that, didn't you?
6236725	eng	Tom wasn't convinced that he needed to do that.
6236726	eng	You think I need to do that today, don't you?
6236727	eng	You told Tom I hated doing that, didn't you?
6236728	eng	Tom wasn't able to do that until he was thirty.
6236729	eng	You think I have to do that today, don't you?
6236730	eng	You think that Tom won't do that, don't you?
6236731	eng	Tom was the first person to tell me about that.
6236732	eng	You think I don't need to do that, don't you?
6236733	eng	You stopped Tom from doing that, didn't you?
6236734	eng	Tom was the first one in our family to do that.
6236735	eng	You think I don't have to do that, don't you?
6236736	eng	You shouldn't have permitted Tom to do that.
6236737	eng	Tom was reading a book all yesterday afternoon.
6236738	eng	You think I can do that by myself, don't you?
6236739	eng	You should've asked Tom before you did that.
6236740	eng	Tom was one of the many people who got injured.
6236741	eng	You still want to do that someday, don't you?
6236742	eng	You should tell Tom you won't do that again.
6236743	eng	Tom usually reads when he's waiting for people.
6236744	eng	You still do that once in a while, don't you?
6236745	eng	You should tell Tom I won't do that anymore.
6236746	eng	Tom used to do that when he was in high school.
6236747	eng	You stayed in Boston for a while, didn't you?
6236748	eng	You should probably tell Tom you'll do that.
6236749	eng	Tom told me that he's interested in doing that.
6236750	eng	You shouldn't have been permitted to do that.
6236751	eng	You should probably show Tom how to do that.
6236752	eng	Tom told me that he'd be in Boston next Monday.
6236753	por	Todos os amores são eternos. O que muda é a pessoa.
6236754	eng	You should've waited until Monday to do that.
6236755	eng	You should probably not tell Tom to do that.
6236756	eng	Tom told me that he has decided not to do that.
6236757	eng	You should've done that before you went home.
6236758	eng	You should let Tom know that you'll do that.
6236759	eng	Tom told me that I wouldn't be able to do that.
6236760	eng	You should try to resist the urge to do that.
6236761	eng	You seem to be trying to get Tom to do that.
6236762	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't be in Boston next week.
6236763	eng	You should stay here with us for a few weeks.
6236764	eng	You seem to be reluctant to do that for Tom.
6236765	eng	Tom thought that doing that would be a mistake.
6236766	eng	You should be able to do that in three hours.
6236767	eng	You refused to help Tom do that, didn't you?
6236768	eng	Tom thought he'd be able to do that by himself.
6236769	eng	You promised us you wouldn't do that anymore.
6236770	eng	You may be able to talk Tom into doing that.
6236771	eng	Tom thought he would be able to do that for me.
6236772	eng	You promised that you wouldn't do that again.
6236773	eng	You know that Tom should do that, don't you?
6236774	eng	Tom thinks that doing that would be a bad idea.
6236775	eng	You never thought I'd do that again, did you?
6236776	eng	You know that Tom has to do that, don't you?
6236777	eng	Tom surprised all of us when he went to Boston.
6236778	eng	You never really enjoyed doing that, did you?
6236779	eng	You know that Tom didn't do that, don't you?
6236780	eng	Tom still isn't very good at playing the flute.
6236781	eng	You never got the chance to do that, did you?
6236782	eng	You know it was Tom who did that, don't you?
6236783	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he has to do that.
6236784	eng	You never expected to do that again, did you?
6236785	eng	You haven't told Tom who did that, have you?
6236786	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he had to do that.
6236787	eng	You need to know the reasons why we did that.
6236788	eng	You don't really think Tom did that, do you?
6236789	eng	Tom still hasn't done what you asked him to do.
6236790	eng	You know I didn't want to do that, don't you?
6236791	eng	You don't like the way Tom did that, do you?
6236792	eng	Tom still doesn't know why he needs to do that.
6236793	eng	You knew that I couldn't do that, didn't you?
6236794	eng	You didn't think Tom would do that, did you?
6236795	eng	Tom stayed with us for three weeks last summer.
6236796	eng	You hope I'm not going to do that, don't you?
6236797	eng	You didn't think Tom could do that, did you?
6236798	eng	Tom started crying when his father spanked him.
6236799	eng	You don't want us to do that anymore, do you?
6236800	eng	You didn't tell Tom how to do that, did you?
6236801	eng	Tom shouldn't do that kind of thing by himself.
6236802	eng	You don't think I'm going to do that, do you?
6236803	eng	You didn't know Tom had to do that, did you?
6236804	eng	Tom should've stayed in Boston a few more days.
6236805	eng	You don't really want to do that now, do you?
6236806	eng	You did that without Tom's help, didn't you?
6236807	eng	Tom should've done that when he had the chance.
6236808	eng	You don't really think I can do that, do you?
6236809	eng	You could make Tom do that if you wanted to.
6236810	eng	Tom should've been finished doing that by 2:30.
6236811	eng	You don't really have to do that now, do you?
6236812	eng	You believe that Tom can do that, don't you?
6236813	eng	Tom should've been amused by what was going on.
6236814	eng	You don't need to do that right away, do you?
6236815	eng	You asked me to do that for Tom, didn't you?
6236816	eng	Tom should've been able to do that much better.
6236817	eng	You don't know why I need to do that, do you?
6236818	eng	You asked if Tom had to do that, didn't you?
6236819	eng	Tom should be glad that that's going to happen.
6236820	eng	You don't know why I have to do that, do you?
6236821	eng	Why did you think Tom would like to do that?
6236822	eng	Tom should be able to do that without any help.
6236823	eng	You don't have to do that unless you want to.
6236824	eng	Who told you Tom couldn't understand French?
6236825	eng	Tom should be able to do that for you, I think.
6236826	eng	You don't have to be tall to play basketball.
6236827	eng	When did you find out Tom had been arrested?
6236828	eng	Tom seems to have started enjoying his classes.
6236829	eng	You don't have time to do that today, do you?
6236830	eng	What do you think of the stew that Tom made?
6236831	eng	Tom seems to have a hard time making ends meet.
6236832	eng	You don't feel like doing that today, do you?
6236833	eng	What did you tell Tom he was supposed to do?
6236834	eng	Tom seems to be the one most likely to do that.
6236835	eng	You don't ever want to do that again, do you?
6236836	eng	What did you tell Tom he was expected to do?
6236837	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what he needed to do.
6236838	eng	You do that at least once a month, don't you?
6236839	eng	What Tom said happened didn't really happen.
6236840	eng	Tom seemed convinced that he needed to do that.
6236841	eng	You didn't think you should do that, did you?
6236842	eng	We may go to Boston next month to visit Tom.
6236843	eng	Tom says that someday he'll be able to do that.
6236844	eng	You didn't think you had to do that, did you?
6236845	eng	Was it you who told Tom he ought to do that?
6236846	eng	Tom says that he's willing to do that for free.
6236847	eng	You didn't realize I had to do that, did you?
6236848	eng	Was it you who told Tom he needs to do that?
6236849	eng	Tom says it's time we did something about that.
6236850	eng	You didn't know anything about this, did you?
6236851	eng	Was it you who told Tom about what happened?
6236852	eng	Tom says he's always been interested in sports.
6236853	eng	You didn't know I shouldn't do that, did you?
6236854	eng	There's little chance that Tom will do that.
6236855	eng	Tom says he thinks it might be easy to do that.
6236856	eng	You didn't know I needed to do that, did you?
6236857	eng	There's apparently no cure for what Tom has.
6236858	eng	Tom says he isn't planning to do that tomorrow.
6236859	eng	You didn't have any help doing that, did you?
6236860	eng	There wasn't enough evidence to convict Tom.
6236861	eng	Tom says he has something to do this afternoon.
6236862	eng	You didn't have a chance to do that, did you?
6236863	eng	The only one here who's able do that is Tom.
6236864	eng	Tom says he doesn't think that'll happen today.
6236865	eng	You didn't actually need to do that, did you?
6236866	eng	The only one here who has to do that is Tom.
6236867	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can do that today.
6236868	eng	You didn't actually have to do that, did you?
6236869	eng	The cut on Tom's leg appears to have healed.
6236870	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how to do that.
6236871	eng	You did apologize for doing that, didn't you?
6236872	eng	Someone tried to steal Tom's car last night.
6236873	eng	Tom says he doesn't need to do that right away.
6236874	eng	You could stay with us in Boston if you want.
6236875	eng	So far, Tom is the only one who's done that.
6236876	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what made him do that.
6236877	eng	You could do that right now if you wanted to.
6236878	eng	Please tell me whether Tom does that or not.
6236879	eng	Tom says he doesn't have to do that right away.
6236880	eng	You could be doing that now if you wanted to.
6236881	eng	Please tell Tom to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6236882	eng	Tom says he doesn't have to do that by himself.
6236883	eng	You can still do that pretty well, can't you?
6236884	eng	Perhaps Tom would enjoy doing that with you.
6236885	eng	Tom says he doesn't have time to do that today.
6236886	eng	You can do that better than anyone else here.
6236887	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what he needs to buy.
6236888	eng	Tom says he doesn't feel like doing that today.
6236889	eng	You always do that in the evening, don't you?
6236890	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that I won't do that.
6236891	eng	Tom says he doesn't ever want to do that again.
6236892	eng	Would you still be willing to do that for us?
6236893	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
6236896	eng	It's clear that Tom doesn't want to do that.
6236897	eng	Tom said your snoring didn't bother him at all.
6236898	eng	Who told you that you didn't need to do that?
6236899	eng	It's clear that Tom doesn't want to be here.
6236900	eng	Tom said you just have to wait a little longer.
6236901	eng	Who told you that you didn't have to do that?
6236902	eng	It's clear that Tom doesn't like doing that.
6236903	eng	Tom said we weren't allowed to do that anymore.
6236904	eng	Who do you like to spend your free time with?
6236905	eng	It sounds like Tom might be able to do that.
6236906	eng	Tom said we needed to be a little more careful.
6236907	eng	Who cooks better, your mother or your father?
6236908	eng	It looks like Tom is about the start crying.
6236909	eng	Tom said there might be one piece of cake left.
6236910	eng	When you need help, who do you usually go to?
6236911	eng	Isn't there a chance that Tom is doing that?
6236912	eng	Tom said that's not likely to happen this week.
6236913	eng	When you have some free time, please do that.
6236914	eng	I've never actually gone on a date with Tom.
6236915	eng	Tom said that won't likely happen anytime soon.
6236916	eng	When the weather's nice, I do that every day.
6236917	eng	I'm the only one who really understands Tom.
6236918	eng	Tom said that probably wouldn't happen anymore.
6236919	eng	What you're planning to do is very dangerous.
6236920	eng	I'm the only one who ever really helped Tom.
6236921	eng	Tom said that he'd be glad to buy that for you.
6236922	eng	What were you doing at 2:30 in the afternoon?
6236923	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be tempted to do that.
6236924	eng	Tom said that he wanted to talk to the manager.
6236925	eng	What do you think the best way to do that is?
6236926	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be up this late at night.
6236927	eng	Tom said that he really did do that by himself.
6236928	eng	What do you think is the best way to do that?
6236929	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be in Boston next Monday.
6236930	eng	Tom said that he needed to talk to the manager.
6236931	eng	What color do you plan to paint your kitchen?
6236932	eng	I'm sure Tom will be ready to leave by 2:30.
6236933	eng	Tom said it's not the first time that happened.
6236934	eng	We've all taught French here for a few years.
6236935	eng	I'm sure Tom isn't the first one to do that.
6236936	eng	Tom said it wouldn't take much time to do that.
6236937	eng	We've all lived in Boston since we were born.
6236938	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom has relatives in Boston.
6236939	eng	Tom said his house wasn't damaged by the storm.
6236940	eng	We're fortunate that we're permitted do that.
6236941	eng	I'm going to ask Tom to never do that again.
6236942	eng	Tom said he's only done that about three times.
6236943	eng	We're fortunate that we were able to do that.
6236944	eng	I'm fairly certain Tom hasn't done that yet.
6236945	eng	Tom said he's looking forward to being retired.
6236946	eng	We might be in Boston the day after tomorrow.
6236947	eng	I'll have to stay here and help Tom do that.
6236948	eng	Tom said he's glad that that's going to happen.
6236949	eng	We hope that you'll be in Boston next spring.
6236950	eng	I wonder why Tom thought you had to do that.
6236951	eng	Tom said he's always been interested in sports.
6236952	eng	We have until October to finish this project.
6236953	eng	I wonder why Tom refused to help us do that.
6236954	eng	Tom said he'll do that for us if we ask him to.
6236955	eng	We don't go to Boston as often as we used to.
6236956	eng	I wonder where Tom found these blackberries.
6236957	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't bet on that horse.
6236958	eng	Three pieces of cheese remained on the plate.
6236959	eng	I wonder if Tom will be in Boston next year.
6236960	eng	Tom said he was present at yesterday's meeting.
6236961	eng	This morning's meeting was longer than usual.
6236962	eng	I wonder if Tom is strong enough to do that.
6236963	eng	Tom said he was going to lie down for a moment.
6236964	eng	They say that no two snowflakes are the same.
6236965	eng	I won't be able to stop Tom from doing that.
6236966	eng	Tom said he wanted to do everything by himself.
6236967	eng	There's no way I could've refused to do that.
6236968	eng	I wish I hadn't borrowed this book from Tom.
6236969	eng	Tom said he thought that would happen tomorrow.
6236970	eng	There's just no way that I can do that today.
6236971	eng	I wish I could play the tuba as well as Tom.
6236972	eng	Tom said he thought I should get more exercise.
6236973	eng	There's a fireplace, but there's no firewood.
6236974	eng	I wasn't the one who advised Tom to do that.
6236975	eng	Tom said he thought I looked like I was sleepy.
6236976	eng	There are still a lot of things I want to do.
6236977	eng	I was told that Tom doesn't have to do that.
6236978	eng	Tom said he thought I looked like I was lonely.
6236979	eng	There are still a lot of things I need to do.
6236980	eng	I want to know when Tom is going to do that.
6236981	eng	Tom said he learned how to do that last summer.
6236982	eng	There are still a lot of things I have to do.
6236983	eng	I want to be gone by the time Tom gets here.
6236984	eng	Tom said he had something to do this afternoon.
6236985	eng	There are at least three Toms at this school.
6236986	eng	I told Tom that I'd be reluctant to do that.
6236987	eng	Tom said he expects to be doing that on Monday.
6236988	eng	The weather was good, so we ate on the porch.
6236989	eng	I told Tom that I thought you could do that.
6236990	eng	Tom said he expected the job to be challenging.
6236991	eng	The road up ahead is blocked by fallen rocks.
6236992	eng	I told Tom I wanted to go mountain climbing.
6236993	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to ever do that again.
6236994	eng	The police said there were no major injuries.
6236995	eng	I told Tom I thought he was wasting my time.
6236996	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that on his own.
6236997	eng	The old man sitting on the wall looked bored.
6236998	eng	I told Tom I didn't need to do that anymore.
6236999	eng	Tom said he doesn't feel like doing that today.
6237000	eng	The man begging for money looked very hungry.
6237001	eng	I told Tom I didn't have to do that anymore.
6237002	eng	Tom said he doesn't ever want to do that again.
6237003	eng	That's the woman I saw yesterday in the park.
6237004	eng	I thought you said you'd ask Tom to do that.
6237005	eng	Tom said he didn't want to play tennis with me.
6237006	eng	Someone else must've seen what happened, too.
6237007	eng	I thought Tom would be reluctant to do that.
6237008	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go to Boston by bus.
6237009	eng	Please give me three tickets for the concert.
6237010	eng	I thought Tom would be motivated to do that.
6237011	eng	Tom said he didn't want to eat leftovers again.
6237013	eng	I thought Tom would be drunk, but he wasn't.
6237014	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to worry about that.
6237015	eng	My son-in-law works for an insurance company.
6237016	eng	I thought Tom wasn't through doing that yet.
6237017	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to help him do that.
6237018	eng	My children asked me to buy them a telescope.
6237019	eng	I thought Tom was supposed to be doing that.
6237020	eng	Tom said he didn't think he'd enjoy doing that.
6237021	eng	Mr. Jackson's first name was never mentioned.
6237022	eng	I thought Tom was smarter than anybody else.
6237023	eng	Tom said he didn't really feel like doing that.
6237024	eng	Maybe you're the only person who can do that.
6237025	eng	I thought Tom was going to have a good time.
6237026	eng	Tom said he didn't have the courage to do that.
6237027	eng	Many people have been complaining about that.
6237028	eng	I thought Tom was going to enjoy doing that.
6237029	eng	Tom said he didn't have anything to write with.
6237030	eng	Let's sit on one of the benches under a tree.
6237031	eng	I thought Tom might be permitted to do that.
6237032	eng	Tom said he didn't get enough sleep last night.
6237033	eng	Let's eat something before we start drinking.
6237034	eng	I thought Tom knew how to play the mandolin.
6237035	eng	Tom said I didn't sound as if I was in trouble.
6237036	eng	It's important that you learn how to do that.
6237037	eng	I think Tom wouldn't wait that long for you.
6237038	eng	Tom retired in 2013 and died three years later.
6237039	eng	It's been decided that I'll do that tomorrow.
6237040	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be hesitant to do that.
6237041	eng	Tom refused to do what I told him he had to do.
6237042	eng	It's an excellent idea, as far as I can tell.
6237043	eng	I think Tom would be safe if he stayed here.
6237044	eng	Tom really wanted to do that yesterday evening.
6237045	eng	It would be wonderful if you did that for me.
6237046	eng	I think Tom would be happier if he did that.
6237047	eng	Tom ran down the street without any clothes on.
6237048	eng	It would be nice if you could do that for me.
6237049	eng	I think Tom won't visit Boston anytime soon.
6237050	eng	Tom put her bag down and went into the kitchen.
6237051	eng	It would be good if you could do that for me.
6237052	eng	I think Tom will be the next one to do that.
6237053	eng	Tom promised me that he wouldn't be late again.
6237054	eng	It would be fantastic if you did that for me.
6237055	eng	I think Tom will be the last one to do that.
6237056	eng	Tom probably won't have the courage to do that.
6237057	eng	It would be dangerous to do that by yourself.
6237058	eng	I think Tom will be in his office on Monday.
6237059	eng	Tom probably won't have a hard time doing that.
6237060	eng	It would be a good idea to do that this week.
6237061	eng	I think Tom will be forgiven for doing that.
6237062	eng	Tom probably won't do that again until October.
6237064	eng	I think Tom will be able to help us do that.
6237065	eng	Tom probably won't be hungry when he gets here.
6237066	eng	It sounds like I won't need to do that again.
6237067	eng	I think Tom wasn't the first one to do that.
6237068	eng	Tom probably won't be doing that today, either.
6237069	eng	It seems like a stupid idea to me to do that.
6237070	eng	I think Tom is waiting for you on the porch.
6237071	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what he needs to buy.
6237072	eng	It probably won't be so expensive to do that.
6237073	eng	I think Tom is the only one who can do that.
6237074	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I won't do that.
6237075	eng	It looks as if someone has already done that.
6237076	eng	I think Tom is just pretending to be asleep.
6237077	eng	Tom probably doesn't know much about Australia.
6237078	eng	It impresses me that you know how to do that.
6237079	eng	I think Tom is doing that, but I'm not sure.
6237080	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
6237081	eng	It doesn't seem that I'll be able to do that.
6237082	eng	I think Tom did that by himself last Monday.
6237083	eng	Tom probably didn't want to do that by himself.
6237084	eng	It doesn't matter whether you do that or not.
6237085	eng	I think Tom could do a lot of things for us.
6237086	eng	Tom overslept and was late for his first class.
6237087	eng	If you don't know how to ski, I'll teach you.
6237088	eng	I suspected Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6237089	eng	Tom opened a cardboard box with his name on it.
6237090	eng	I've loved you since the moment we first met.
6237091	eng	I should've told Tom what needed to be done.
6237092	eng	Tom only eats out when his wife is out of town.
6237093	eng	I've been waiting in line for thirty minutes.
6237094	eng	I should've told Tom that he had to do that.
6237095	eng	Tom never expected to be able to do that again.
6237096	eng	I'm very tired and I want to go to bed early.
6237097	eng	I should've let Tom do what he wanted to do.
6237098	eng	Tom needs to stay in Boston for a couple weeks.
6237099	eng	I'm the only person who knows how to do that.
6237100	eng	I should've known that I couldn't trust Tom.
6237101	eng	Tom may need to stay in Boston a little longer.
6237102	eng	I'm sure I won't be allowed to do that again.
6237103	eng	I should've done that the way Tom suggested.
6237104	eng	Tom lives in a small house with his three dogs.
6237105	eng	I'm still not very good at playing the flute.
6237106	eng	I should tell Tom that he shouldn't do that.
6237107	eng	Tom lives downtown not far from where he works.
6237108	eng	I'm probably the only person who can do that.
6237109	eng	I should tell Tom I don't intend to do that.
6237110	eng	Tom lived in a small town for most of his life.
6237111	eng	I'm only going to have one chance to do that.
6237112	eng	I should be able to do that better than Tom.
6237113	eng	Tom likes to read when he's waiting for people.
6237114	eng	I'm not going to teach French here next year.
6237115	eng	I really should've told Tom to visit Boston.
6237116	eng	Tom knows he's not supposed to do that anymore.
6237117	eng	I'm not going to eat the rest of my sandwich.
6237118	eng	I really don't want to tell Tom where I was.
6237119	eng	Tom knows he'll never be able to do that again.
6237120	eng	I'm going to have to do that sooner or later.
6237121	eng	I pretended that I didn't know Tom was rich.
6237122	eng	Tom isn't willing to do that without some help.
6237123	eng	I'm embarrassed because I can't do that well.
6237124	eng	I never thought I'd see Tom in Boston again.
6237125	eng	Tom isn't the kind of person who would do that.
6237126	eng	I'll help you as soon as I finish doing this.
6237127	eng	I need to ask Tom for permission to do that.
6237128	eng	Tom isn't likely to be arrested for doing that.
6237129	eng	I'll do that whether I get permission or not.
6237130	eng	I know Tom could do that if he tried harder.
6237131	eng	Tom isn't likely to be through doing that.
6237132	eng	I'd rather do that now while it's still cool.
6237133	eng	I know I'm not supposed to help Tom do that.
6237134	eng	Tom isn't likely to be tempted to do that.
6237135	eng	I'd rather be doing something else right now.
6237136	eng	I know I won't be able to change Tom's mind.
6237137	eng	Tom isn't likely to be fascinated by that.
6237138	eng	I'd be grateful for any help you could offer.
6237139	eng	I knew that Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6237140	eng	Tom isn't going to be very happy to leave here.
6237141	eng	I wouldn't do that even if I were very bored.
6237142	eng	I knew Tom wouldn't likely agree to do that.
6237143	eng	Tom isn't doing what he's supposed to be doing.
6237144	eng	I wouldn't be doing that if I didn't need to.
6237145	eng	I knew Tom would likely not want to do that.
6237146	eng	Tom isn't adventurous enough to try doing that.
6237147	eng	I wouldn't be doing that if I didn't have to.
6237148	eng	I hope Tom knows he doesn't need to do that.
6237149	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what we need to do.
6237150	eng	I wonder if it would be dangerous to do that.
6237151	eng	I hope Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
6237152	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what we have to do.
6237153	eng	I wish I'd been courageous enough to do that.
6237154	eng	I hope Tom is gone by the time we get there.
6237155	eng	Tom is trying hard to do what needs to be done.
6237156	eng	I wish I was better at playing the saxophone.
6237157	eng	I haven't heard from Tom since last October.
6237158	eng	Tom is the only person here I can really trust.
6237159	eng	I watched a basketball game on TV last night.
6237160	eng	I have a feeling that Tom needed to do that.
6237161	eng	Tom is the only one who didn't need to do that.
6237162	eng	I wasn't aware that I was being photographed.
6237163	eng	I guess I should've expected Tom to do that.
6237164	eng	Tom is the only one who didn't have to do that.
6237165	eng	I was wondering if you'd like to do that now.
6237166	eng	I forgot to tell Tom that I needed his help.
6237167	eng	Tom is the only one who didn't do his homework.
6237168	eng	I wanted to thank you for helping me do that.
6237169	eng	I doubt if Tom will be reluctant to do that.
6237170	eng	Tom is the one who knows what needs to be done.
6237171	eng	I wanted to do that, but I wasn't allowed to.
6237172	eng	I doubt if Tom will be motivated to do that.
6237173	eng	Tom is supposed to do that before he goes home.
6237174	eng	I want to stay in Boston for at least a week.
6237175	eng	I doubt if Tom will be desperate to do that.
6237176	eng	Tom is sitting at one of the tables back there.
6237177	eng	I want to stay in Boston for a few more days.
6237178	eng	I don't want Tom to kiss me in public again.
6237179	eng	Tom is saving money so he can buy a motorcycle.
6237180	eng	I want to rent a house close to where I work.
6237181	eng	I don't want Tom to go to Boston without me.
6237182	eng	Tom is probably not going to do that very well.
6237183	eng	I want to know why you haven't done that yet.
6237184	eng	I don't understand why Tom ought to do that.
6237185	eng	Tom is probably not going to do that this week.
6237186	eng	I want to know if you've ever been to Boston.
6237187	eng	I don't understand why Tom needs to do that.
6237188	eng	Tom is probably not as rich as he claims to be.
6237189	eng	I want to know how I can lose weight quickly.
6237190	eng	I don't think they'll permit Tom to do that.
6237191	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who could do that.
6237192	eng	I thought you were the one chosen to do that.
6237193	eng	I don't think that Tom made a wise decision.
6237194	eng	Tom is one of the nicest kids I've ever taught.
6237195	eng	I thought you were supposed to do that today.
6237196	eng	I don't think Tom would still be downstairs.
6237197	eng	Tom is now richer than he ever thought he'd be.
6237198	eng	I thought you were still planning to do that.
6237199	eng	I don't think Tom would have fun doing that.
6237200	eng	Tom is likely to still be reluctant to do that.
6237201	eng	I thought you said you're willing to do that.
6237202	eng	I don't think Tom would ever really do that.
6237203	eng	Tom is likely to still be motivated to do that.
6237204	eng	I thought you said you'd never do that again.
6237205	eng	I don't think Tom would allow me to do that.
6237206	eng	Tom is likely to still be desperate to do that.
6237207	eng	I thought you said you were ready to do that.
6237208	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that tomorrow.
6237209	eng	Tom is likely to be present at today's meeting.
6237210	eng	I thought you said you were going to do that.
6237211	eng	I don't think Tom really enjoyed doing that.
6237212	eng	Tom is going to Boston to live with his father.
6237213	eng	I thought I'd be finished doing that by 2:30.
6237214	eng	I don't think Tom needed to do that outside.
6237215	eng	Tom is getting to be pretty good at doing that.
6237216	eng	I thought I was going to get a higher salary.
6237217	eng	I don't think Tom could handle the pressure.
6237218	eng	Tom is different from the rest of the children.
6237219	eng	I thought I might be coming down with a cold.
6237220	eng	I don't think Tom can afford to buy any car.
6237221	eng	Tom is a lot more interesting than his brother.
6237222	eng	I think this is the perfect place to do that.
6237223	eng	I don't speak French and Tom doesn't either.
6237224	eng	Tom is a lot less interesting than his brother.
6237225	eng	I think it'll be impossible to do that today.
6237226	eng	I don't really want to tell Tom where I was.
6237227	eng	Tom is a little bit tired, so he won't do that.
6237228	eng	I think it would be disrespectful to do that.
6237229	eng	I don't really expect Tom to be at my party.
6237230	eng	Tom hopes to be back in Boston by late October.
6237231	eng	I think it might not be dangerous to do that.
6237232	eng	I don't need to stay home to help Tom today.
6237233	eng	Tom hopes he doesn't have to work this weekend.
6237234	eng	I think I'll stay in Boston for another week.
6237235	eng	I don't know why Tom wasn't at school today.
6237236	eng	Tom hasn't yet told me why he needs to do that.
6237237	eng	I think I could come to Boston for Christmas.
6237238	eng	I don't know why Tom is supposed to do that.
6237239	eng	Tom hasn't played volleyball since high school.
6237240	eng	I still haven't done what you asked me to do.
6237241	eng	I don't know why Tom dropped out of college.
6237242	eng	Tom has worked for our company for three years.
6237243	eng	I still haven't done what I'm supposed to do.
6237244	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't want to do that.
6237245	eng	Tom has wanted to learn French for a long time.
6237246	eng	I still come to Boston at least once a month.
6237247	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't need to do that.
6237248	eng	Tom has to go to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6237249	eng	I shouldn't have been doing what I was doing.
6237250	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't have to do that.
6237251	eng	Tom has to do that before he can go home today.
6237252	eng	I should've stayed in Boston a little longer.
6237253	eng	I don't know whether Tom is swimming or not.
6237254	eng	Tom has to be present at the meeting on Monday.
6237255	eng	I should've been finished doing that by 2:30.
6237256	eng	I don't know whether Tom can do that or not.
6237257	eng	Tom has never had the chance to try doing that.
6237258	eng	I should've been able to do that much better.
6237259	eng	I don't know where Tom went to kindergarten.
6237260	eng	Tom has never had a real job in his whole life.
6237261	eng	I should be able to do that without any help.
6237262	eng	I don't know where Tom learned how to drive.
6237263	eng	Tom has never asked me to help him do anything.
6237264	eng	I pretended I didn't know what was happening.
6237265	eng	I don't know when Tom will leave for Boston.
6237266	eng	Tom has done that more than he'd like to admit.
6237267	eng	I never expected to be able to do that again.
6237268	eng	I don't know if Tom likes spicy food or not.
6237269	eng	Tom has done almost nothing we asked him to do.
6237270	eng	I might live in Boston for another few years.
6237271	eng	I don't know exactly when Tom will get home.
6237272	eng	Tom has definitely gotten better at doing that.
6237273	eng	I majored in chemistry when I was in college.
6237274	eng	I don't have to stay home to help Tom today.
6237275	eng	Tom has decided I'm the one who should do that.
6237276	eng	I looked around, but I couldn't see anything.
6237277	eng	I don't have as much experience as Tom does.
6237278	eng	Tom has been sentenced to three months in jail.
6237279	eng	I know there must be some way we can do that.
6237280	eng	I don't believe Tom really wants to do that.
6237281	eng	Tom has been living by himself for three years.
6237282	eng	I know how to catch birds with my bare hands.
6237283	eng	I don't believe Tom really needs to do that.
6237284	eng	Tom has been collecting information about fish.
6237285	eng	I know I'm not supposed to do that by myself.
6237286	eng	I didn't wear the shirt Tom told me to wear.
6237288	eng	I knew I didn't have anything to worry about.
6237289	eng	I didn't want to do that without Tom's help.
6237290	eng	Tom has already spent all the money I gave him.
6237291	eng	I hung on to the rope for as long as I could.
6237292	eng	I didn't want Tom to know what had happened.
6237293	eng	Tom has a better chance of winning than you do.
6237294	eng	I hope you don't get punished for doing that.
6237295	eng	I didn't want Tom to go, but he went anyway.
6237296	eng	Tom had a very tough time making friends there.
6237297	eng	I hope you don't get arrested for doing that.
6237298	eng	I didn't understand what Tom said in French.
6237299	eng	Tom got home yesterday afternoon at about 2:30.
6237300	eng	I hope I get a lot of presents for Christmas.
6237301	eng	I didn't think you'd be afraid of Tom's dog.
6237302	eng	Tom gets his hair cut about three times a year.
6237303	eng	I hope I can visit Boston in the near future.
6237304	eng	I didn't think Tom would do that by himself.
6237305	eng	Tom explained why it was a bad idea to do that.
6237306	eng	I had the opportunity to do that last summer.
6237307	eng	I didn't think Tom would be doing that here.
6237308	eng	Tom doesn't want to spend much time doing that.
6237309	eng	I guess I'd rather go to Boston than Chicago.
6237310	eng	I didn't think Tom was being careful enough.
6237311	eng	Tom doesn't want to be the last one to do that.
6237312	eng	I don't yet have enough money to buy a house.
6237313	eng	I didn't think Tom really wanted to do that.
6237314	eng	Tom doesn't want to be here and I don't either.
6237315	eng	I don't want anyone looking through my stuff.
6237316	eng	I didn't think Tom really needed to do that.
6237317	eng	Tom doesn't want me to show you how to do that.
6237318	eng	I don't think you'll be permitted to do that.
6237319	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I was going to Boston.
6237320	eng	Tom doesn't think you'll be allowed to do that.
6237321	eng	I don't think you should do that by yourself.
6237322	eng	I didn't tell Tom who my French teacher was.
6237323	eng	Tom doesn't think they'll permit me to do that.
6237324	eng	I don't think that doing that is a good idea.
6237325	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I was supposed to do.
6237326	eng	Tom doesn't think they'll allow you to do that.
6237327	eng	I don't think I'll have to do that by myself.
6237328	eng	I didn't tell Tom I had been married before.
6237329	eng	Tom doesn't think they'll allow him to do that.
6237330	eng	I don't swim, but I enjoy going to the beach.
6237331	eng	I didn't tell Tom I didn't know how to swim.
6237332	eng	Tom doesn't think it's safe for you to do that.
6237333	eng	I don't really know how to do that very well.
6237334	eng	I didn't really want to help Tom, but I did.
6237335	eng	Tom doesn't think I'll be permitted to do that.
6237336	eng	I don't plan to do that until you tell me to.
6237337	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted to do that.
6237338	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be having such a good time.
6237339	eng	I don't need to worry about things like that.
6237340	eng	I didn't pay any attention to Tom's warning.
6237341	eng	Tom doesn't need me to do that for him anymore.
6237342	eng	I don't make as much money as you think I do.
6237343	eng	I didn't know you used to be married to Tom.
6237344	eng	Tom doesn't know who he should ask to help him.
6237345	eng	I don't know why I'm not supposed to do that.
6237346	eng	I didn't know whether to believe Tom or not.
6237347	eng	Tom doesn't know who can do that and who can't.
6237348	eng	I don't know who can sing well and who can't.
6237349	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was sleepy or not.
6237350	eng	Tom doesn't know whether he can do that or not.
6237351	eng	I don't know whether I should do that or not.
6237352	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was hungry or not.
6237353	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly what needs to be done.
6237354	eng	I don't know if that's true, but it might be.
6237355	eng	I didn't know whether Tom could swim or not.
6237356	eng	Tom doesn't have the time to do that right now.
6237357	eng	I don't know how to use this washing machine.
6237358	eng	I didn't know when Tom was going to do that.

6237360	eng	I don't know how to do what needs to be done.
6237361	eng	I didn't know the reason why Tom was crying.
6237362	eng	Tom doesn't have many opportunities to do that.
6237363	eng	I don't know anything about raising children.
6237364	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to kiss me.
6237365	eng	Tom died in a traffic accident three weeks ago.
6237366	eng	I don't have very much experience doing that.
6237367	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to be here.
6237368	eng	Tom didn't think the burning car would explode.
6237369	eng	I don't have to worry about things like that.
6237370	eng	I didn't know that Tom was a French teacher.
6237371	eng	Tom didn't tell me why he wanted me to do that.
6237372	eng	I don't have those kinds of problems anymore.
6237373	eng	I didn't know that Tom used to teach French.
6237374	eng	Tom didn't tell me he wanted to be a scientist.
6237375	eng	I don't have enough money to buy what I need.
6237376	eng	I didn't know Tom was still studying French.
6237377	eng	Tom didn't seem to know why that was happening.
6237378	eng	I don't have as many close friends as you do.
6237380	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that was happening.
6237381	eng	I don't have a ticket for tomorrow's concert.
6237382	eng	I didn't find the money that Tom had hidden.
6237383	eng	Tom didn't lose as much weight as he wanted to.
6237384	eng	I don't have a credit card or a bank account.
6237385	eng	I didn't do that because Tom told me not to.
6237386	eng	Tom didn't know we weren't supposed to do that.
6237387	eng	I don't get the chance to do that very often.
6237388	eng	I didn't buy Tom's explanation for a second.
6237389	eng	Tom didn't know that he didn't need to do that.
6237390	eng	I didn't want to stop doing what I was doing.
6237391	eng	How often does Tom go to Boston on business?
6237392	eng	Tom didn't know that he didn't have to do that.
6237393	eng	I didn't want to be the first one to do that.
6237394	eng	How often do you help Tom with his homework?
6237395	eng	Tom didn't know that I was supposed to do that.
6237396	eng	I didn't want to be alone on Valentine's Day.
6237397	eng	How many times will Tom to do that tomorrow?
6237398	eng	Tom didn't know how much money had been stolen.
6237399	eng	I didn't want the same thing to happen to me.
6237400	eng	How many seconds did it take Tom to do that?
6237401	eng	Tom didn't know I was supposed to do by myself.
6237402	eng	I didn't want the same thing to happen again.
6237404	eng	Tom didn't get home until very late last night.
6237405	eng	I didn't want my parents to know I was drunk.
6237406	eng	How many months will it take Tom to do that?
6237407	eng	Tom did that here yesterday for the first time.
6237408	eng	I didn't think I would be nervous doing that.
6237409	eng	How many minutes did it take Tom to do that?
6237410	eng	Tom could've refused to do that, but he didn't.
6237411	eng	I didn't tell my wife that I'd been laid off.
6237413	eng	Tom could be busy now, but I don't think he is.
6237414	eng	I didn't study, but I passed the test anyway.
6237415	eng	How did you know what else Tom needed to do?
6237416	eng	Tom continued to do that until the day he died.
6237417	eng	I didn't see any familiar faces at the party.
6237418	eng	How did you know Tom would agree to do that?
6237419	eng	Tom climbed up the tree as quickly as he could.
6237420	eng	I didn't really think I'd be able to do that.
6237421	eng	How did you know Tom was going be in Boston?
6237422	eng	Tom came over for just as I was about to leave.
6237423	eng	I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.
6237424	eng	Has Tom decided what he's going to major in?
6237425	eng	Tom began taking piano lessons three years ago.
6237426	eng	I didn't need to hurry. I had plenty of time.
6237427	eng	Do you think that Tom will do that tomorrow?
6237428	eng	Tom asked me if I knew how to get to his house.
6237429	eng	I didn't need to finish doing that yesterday.
6237430	eng	Do you think Tom would permit us to do that?
6237431	eng	Tom asked if he was really required to do that.
6237432	eng	I didn't like beer the first time I tried it.
6237433	eng	Do you think Tom would permit me to do that?
6237434	eng	Tom asked if he really needed to wear a helmet.
6237435	eng	I didn't know you were still studying French.
6237436	eng	Do you think Tom would be unable to do that?
6237437	eng	Tom apparently has to speak French for his job.
6237438	eng	I didn't know you used to have a crush on me.
6237439	eng	Do you think Tom would be afraid to do that?
6237440	eng	Tom and three other prisoners got into a fight.
6237441	eng	I didn't know you didn't know how to do that.
6237442	eng	Do you think Tom might be a little confused?
6237443	eng	Tom and I were sitting together at the concert.
6237444	eng	I didn't know whether I could do that or not.
6237445	eng	Do you know whether or not Tom will do that?
6237446	eng	Tom and I were just talking about that earlier.
6237447	eng	I didn't know when I was supposed to do that.
6237448	eng	Didn't you know that Tom saw you doing that?
6237449	eng	Tom and I were at home together that afternoon.
6237450	eng	I didn't know what to do when I broke my leg.
6237451	eng	Didn't you know that Tom also speaks French?
6237452	eng	Tom and I went sailing together three days ago.
6237453	eng	I didn't know what time I needed to be there.
6237454	eng	Didn't you know Tom wasn't going to do that?
6237455	eng	Tom and I went for a drive yesterday afternoon.
6237456	eng	I didn't know that you'd already bought eggs.
6237457	eng	Didn't you know Tom was supposed to do that?
6237458	eng	Tom and I sometimes speak French to each other.
6237460	eng	Didn't you know Tom was planning to do that?
6237461	eng	Tom and I seldom speak to each other in French.
6237462	eng	I didn't know that you were a French teacher.
6237463	eng	Didn't you know Tom was allergic to walnuts?
6237464	eng	Tom and I looked at each other for a long time.
6237465	eng	I didn't know that you couldn't speak French.
6237466	eng	Didn't you know Tom had more than one house?

6237471	eng	I didn't know that I needed to do that today.
6237472	eng	Didn't you know Tom doesn't like doing that?

6237474	eng	I didn't know that I had done anything wrong.
6237475	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't enjoy doing that?
6237476	eng	Tom and I entered the library at the same time.
6237477	eng	I didn't know how much the ticket would cost.
6237478	eng	Didn't you know Tom could hear what we said?

6237486	eng	I didn't have time to do what had to be done.
6237487	eng	Did you know Tom is good at speaking French?

6237489	eng	I didn't have time to do what I wanted to do.
6237490	eng	Did you know Tom is actually a conservative?
6237491	eng	Tom and I aren't talking to each other anymore.
6237492	eng	I didn't have time to do what I needed to do.
6237493	eng	Can you remember the first time you met Tom?
6237494	eng	Tom and I are thinking about getting a divorce.
6237495	eng	I didn't have enough money to go home by bus.
6237496	eng	Both of Tom's brothers died in the accident.
6237497	eng	Tom and I are going to tie the knot in October.
6237498	eng	I didn't have any money, so I didn't do that.
6237499	eng	All three of Tom's brothers want to do that.
6237500	eng	Tom and I are going out for a drink after work.
6237501	eng	I didn't get home until very late last night.
6237502	eng	You're a little older than Tom, aren't you?
6237503	eng	Tom and I always speak to each other in French.
6237504	eng	I didn't bring that matter up at the meeting.
6237505	eng	You're a close friend of Tom's, aren't you?
6237506	eng	Tom already owns more cars than he'll ever use.
6237507	eng	I can't go to Boston until after next Monday.
6237508	eng	You'll teach Tom how to do that, won't you?
6237509	eng	Tom admitted he was the one who broke the eggs.
6237510	eng	I bought a handmade rug a couple of days ago.
6237511	eng	You wouldn't ask Tom to do that, would you?
6237512	eng	Tom admitted he didn't want to do that anymore.
6237513	eng	I admitted that I didn't know how to do that.
6237514	eng	You want Tom to do that for you, don't you?
6237515	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what he said he'd do.
6237516	eng	How many times do you think you've done that?
6237517	eng	You waited until Tom got there, didn't you?
6237518	eng	Tom admitted he did what he promised not to do.
6237519	eng	How many times did you go skiing last winter?

6237522	eng	How many times did you go hiking last summer?
6237523	eng	You told Tom he should do that, didn't you?

6237525	eng	How many textbooks did you buy last semester?
6237526	eng	You think that Tom will do that, don't you?
6237527	eng	Tom's doctor advised him to get more exercise.
6237528	eng	How many minutes will it take you to do that?
6237529	eng	You think Tom shouldn't do that, don't you?
6237530	eng	Tom would've done that already if he knew how.
6237531	eng	How many days will it really take to do that?
6237532	eng	You still hope Tom will do that, don't you?
6237533	eng	Tom would've done that already if he could've.
6237534	eng	How many days does it really take to do that?
6237535	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom where you live.
6237536	eng	Tom would stop doing that if you asked him to.
6237537	eng	How long have you been trying to lose weight?
6237538	eng	You should've told Tom to buy that for you.
6237539	eng	Tom would probably be able to do that for you.
6237540	eng	Have you ever been criticized for doing that?
6237541	eng	You should've asked Tom to do that for you.
6237542	eng	Tom would like you to show him how to do that.
6237543	eng	Don't you think it would be wrong to do that?
6237544	eng	You should tell Tom why you had to do that.
6237545	eng	Tom would like to know why you didn't do that.
6237546	eng	Don't you think it would be smart to do that?
6237547	eng	You should tell Tom that he has to do that.
6237548	eng	Tom would have to be pretty stupid to do that.
6237549	eng	Don't you think it would be risky to do that?
6237550	eng	You seem convinced that Tom has to do that.
6237551	eng	Tom won't likely have to do that anytime soon.
6237552	eng	Doing that would be the sensible thing to do.
6237553	eng	You need to keep Tom from doing that again.
6237554	eng	Tom won't likely be very concerned about that.
6237555	eng	Doing that would be the rational thing to do.
6237556	eng	You know why Tom has to do that, don't you?
6237557	eng	Tom won't likely be amused by what's going on.
6237558	eng	Do you think doing that would be a good idea?
6237559	eng	You know why Tom didn't do that, don't you?
6237560	eng	Tom won't be finished doing that until Monday.
6237561	eng	Do you still do that as often as you used to?
6237562	eng	You knew Tom wanted to do that, didn't you?
6237563	eng	Tom won't be as busy tomorrow as he was today.
6237564	eng	Do you really think it's possible to do that?
6237565	eng	You knew Tom shouldn't do that, didn't you?
6237566	eng	Tom won't be able to move the desk by himself.
6237567	eng	Do you really think it would safe to do that?
6237568	eng	You knew Tom needed to do that, didn't you?
6237569	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without our help.
6237570	eng	Do you really think doing that would be wise?
6237571	eng	You hope that Tom won't do that, don't you?
6237572	eng	Tom won't be able to do that until next month.
6237573	eng	Do you really think doing that would be safe?
6237574	eng	You haven't asked Tom to do that, have you?
6237575	eng	Tom will very likely get fired for doing that.
6237576	eng	Do you really think doing that would be easy?
6237577	eng	You have to keep Tom from doing that again.
6237578	eng	Tom will probably have a hard time doing that.
6237579	eng	Do you know what Mr. Jackson's first name is?
6237580	eng	You forgave Tom for doing that, didn't you?
6237581	eng	Tom will probably have a good time doing that.
6237582	eng	Do you always lock your house when you leave?
6237583	eng	You don't think Tom should do that, do you?
6237584	eng	Tom will probably get injured if he does that.
6237585	eng	Didn't you know you were supposed to do that?
6237586	eng	You don't think Tom did that right, do you?
6237587	eng	Tom will probably be the last one to get here.
6237588	eng	Didn't you know you could get there by train?
6237589	eng	You don't know why Tom wants me to do that.
6237590	eng	Tom will probably be the first one to do that.
6237591	eng	Didn't you know this building had a basement?
6237592	eng	You don't know why Tom did do that, do you?
6237593	eng	Tom will probably be interested in doing that.

6237606	eng	Did you know Mozart wrote a bassoon concerto?
6237607	eng	You asked Tom how he'd do that, didn't you?
6237608	eng	Tom will probably be excited about doing that.
6237609	eng	Could you take care of my dog while I'm away?
6237610	eng	You agreed to help Tom do that, didn't you?
6237611	eng	Tom will likely be present at today's meeting.
6237612	eng	Can you tell me exactly what you tried to do?
6237613	eng	Will Tom study French with us this evening?
6237614	eng	Tom will likely be out of the office all week.
6237615	eng	Can you remember the first time you did that?
6237616	eng	Why do you think Tom won't have to do that?
6237617	eng	Tom will be thirsty when he finishes the race.
6237618	eng	Aren't you the one who's supposed to do that?
6237619	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that?
6237620	eng	Tom will be the only one permitted to do that.
6237621	eng	Are your parents still married to each other?
6237622	eng	Who told you Tom would know how to do that?
6237623	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who wanted to do that.
6237624	eng	Are you sure that you won't do that tomorrow?
6237625	eng	Who told you Tom was living on Park Street?
6237626	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who needed to do that.
6237627	eng	Are you going to come to Boston next weekend?
6237628	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom do that?
6237629	eng	Tom wasn't the first one to decide to do that.
6237630	eng	All three of my sisters died in the accident.
6237631	eng	When did you find out Tom had been injured?
6237632	eng	Tom was the one who talked me into doing that.
6237633	eng	About how many years will it take to do that?
6237634	eng	Were you impressed by the way Tom did that?
6237635	eng	Tom was the one responsible for what happened.
6237636	eng	About how many years does it take to do that?
6237637	eng	We've been looking for Tom for a long time.
6237638	eng	Tom was the first one to volunteer to help us.
6237639	eng	About how many weeks will it take to do that?
6237640	eng	We should try to get Tom to come to Boston.
6237641	eng	Tom was only able to do that for a short time.
6237642	eng	About how many weeks does it take to do that?
6237643	eng	We never would've permitted Tom to do that.
6237644	eng	Tom was never told what had actually happened.
6237645	eng	About how many hours will it take to do that?
6237646	eng	We didn't know whether Tom was busy or not.
6237647	eng	Tom was living in Boston when I first met him.
6237648	eng	About how many hours does it take to do that?
6237649	eng	Wasn't Tom supposed to do that before 2:30?
6237650	eng	Tom wants to do that, but he doesn't know how.
6237651	eng	About how many books did you read last month?
6237652	eng	There's no way Tom would forget to do that.
6237653	eng	Tom wanted to do that, but he didn't know how.
6237654	eng	A lot of people criticized me for doing that.
6237655	eng	That was the first time Tom ever kissed me.
6237656	eng	Tom used to have a summer home near the beach.
6237657	eng	"Have you ever done that?" "Yes, many times."
6237658	eng	That was the first time I'd seen Tom dance.
6237659	eng	Tom told us that we needed to be more careful.
6237660	eng	You've worked in Boston before, haven't you?
6237661	eng	Tell Tom he needs to get that done by 2:30.
6237662	eng	Tom told the police that he heard three shots.
6237663	eng	You've never done that kind of thing before.
6237664	eng	Please tell Tom that I'll do that tomorrow.
6237665	eng	Tom told me why it was a good idea to do that.
6237666	eng	You're the only one who volunteered to help.
6237667	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to get here early.
6237668	eng	Tom told me that he's the next one to do that.
6237669	eng	You're one of the friendliest people I know.
6237670	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to do that.
6237671	eng	Tom told me that he was proud of his children.
6237672	eng	You're not doing that the way I told you to.
6237673	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't have to do that.
6237674	eng	Tom told me that he thought you could do that.
6237675	eng	You'll never be given the chance to do that.
6237676	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want to do that.
6237677	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't know what that is.
6237678	eng	You'll never be able to do that by yourself.
6237679	eng	My guess is that Tom won't need to do that.
6237680	eng	Tom told me that Boston was his favorite city.
6237681	eng	You'll have plenty of time to do that later.
6237682	eng	My guess is that Tom won't have to do that.
6237683	eng	Tom told me his parents were getting divorced.
6237684	eng	You'll find that doing that is a lot of fun.
6237685	eng	Maybe Tom won't come to Boston this summer.
6237686	eng	Tom told me he wanted to learn how to do that.
6237687	eng	You'll eventually figure out how to do that.
6237688	eng	Just make sure you tell Tom not to do that.
6237689	eng	Tom told me I wasn't doing that the right way.
6237690	eng	You'll be the only one permitted to do that.
6237691	eng	It's necessary for Tom to go there himself.
6237692	eng	Tom thought he would be able to do that today.
6237693	eng	You'd get angry if I did that, wouldn't you?
6237694	eng	It's likely that Tom will do that tomorrow.
6237695	eng	Tom thought I was going to be able to do that.
6237696	eng	You weren't able to do that today, were you?
6237697	eng	It's already 2:30 and Tom still isn't here.
6237698	eng	Tom thinks that doing that would be a mistake.
6237699	eng	You were the only who did that, weren't you?
6237700	eng	It'll probably be tough for Tom to do that.
6237701	eng	Tom survived the accident with minor injuries.
6237702	eng	You were able to do that today, weren't you?
6237703	eng	It'll probably be risky for Tom to do that.
6237704	eng	Tom still hasn't told me why he won't do that.
6237705	eng	You want to learn how to do that, don't you?
6237706	eng	It wouldn't be very nice to do that to Tom.
6237707	eng	Tom still has a lot of things he wants to buy.
6237708	eng	You used to do that quite often, didn't you?
6237709	eng	It would be foolish for Tom not to do that.
6237710	eng	Tom still has a lot of things he needs to buy.
6237711	eng	You used to be a country singer, didn't you?
6237712	eng	It would be fantastic if Tom could do that.
6237713	eng	Tom still does that even though he's very old.
6237714	eng	You thought I'd stop doing that, didn't you?
6237715	eng	It sounds like Tom doesn't want to do that.
6237716	eng	Tom spent the whole afternoon feeding pigeons.
6237717	eng	You thought I'd quit doing that, didn't you?
6237718	eng	It sounds like Tom doesn't need to do that.
6237719	eng	Tom spent most of his free time reading books.
6237720	eng	You thought I shouldn't do that, didn't you?
6237721	eng	It sounds like Tom doesn't have to do that.
6237722	eng	Tom spent his summer vacation studying French.
6237723	eng	You thought I needed to do that, didn't you?
6237724	eng	It seems to me that Tom is doing very well.
6237725	eng	Tom showed the old man the way to the station.
6237726	eng	You think I do that all the time, don't you?
6237727	eng	It seems like Tom is having fun doing that.
6237728	eng	Tom should've taken the examination yesterday.
6237729	eng	You swore you'd be in Boston on my birthday.
6237730	eng	It looks like Tom might be able to do that.
6237731	eng	Tom should've been studying French last night.
6237732	eng	You still don't know how to do that, do you?
6237733	eng	It looks like Tom isn't having a good time.
6237734	eng	Tom should've been able to do that on his own.
6237735	eng	You shouldn't speak French in the classroom.
6237736	eng	It looks like Tom is having fun doing that.
6237737	eng	Tom should've been able to do that by himself.
6237738	eng	You should've been the first one to do that.
6237739	eng	It looks as if Tom is doing that right now.
6237740	eng	Tom should be able to show you how to do that.
6237741	eng	You should make sure that you do that today.
6237742	eng	It doesn't seem like Tom enjoys doing that.
6237743	eng	Tom should be able to do that without my help.
6237744	eng	You should go ahead and do that by yourself.
6237745	eng	It didn't seem like Tom enjoyed doing that.
6237746	eng	Tom seldom, if ever, complains about anything.
6237747	eng	You should do that while you're still young.
6237748	eng	Is there any chance that Tom won't do that?
6237749	eng	Tom seems to have started to enjoy doing that.
6237750	eng	You should do that now before it's too late.
6237751	eng	I've promised to do that with Tom tomorrow.
6237752	eng	Tom seems to have lost interest in doing that.
6237753	eng	You really like to do that a lot, don't you?
6237754	eng	I've been asked to help Tom write a speech.
6237755	eng	Tom says there's nothing he can do about that.
6237756	eng	You really like doing that a lot, don't you?
6237757	eng	I'm worried that Tom won't like my parents.
6237758	eng	Tom says he's too old to start doing that now.
6237759	eng	You might not feel like doing that tomorrow.
6237760	eng	I'm the only person who can help Tom today.
6237761	eng	Tom says he won't do that unless you help him.
6237762	eng	You look more like a teacher than a student.
6237763	eng	I'm the only one who ever really liked Tom.
6237764	eng	Tom says he wants to do everything by himself.
6237765	eng	You look like you've put on a little weight.
6237766	eng	I'm sure that's not the school Tom goes to.
6237767	eng	Tom says he thinks he might be fired tomorrow.
6237768	eng	You know why I needed to do that, don't you?
6237769	eng	I'm sure that's not the medicine Tom needs.
6237770	eng	Tom says he sells about thirty of these a day.
6237771	eng	You know I'm supposed to do that, don't you?
6237772	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't permit me to do that.
6237773	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to live in Australia.
6237774	eng	You know I have to do that today, don't you?
6237775	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if you did that.
6237776	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he ought to do that.
6237777	eng	You knew I'd be able to do that, didn't you?
6237778	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't care if you did that.
6237779	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how old he is.
6237780	eng	You hope to do that this weekend, don't you?
6237781	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be afraid to do that.
6237782	eng	Tom says he doesn't know where he should park.
6237783	eng	You haven't finish doing that yet, have you?
6237784	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be reluctant to do that.
6237785	eng	Tom says he doesn't know if he has to do that.
6237786	eng	You don't want to do that right now, do you?
6237787	eng	I'm sure Tom will be ready to do that soon.
6237788	eng	Tom says he doesn't feel motivated to do that.
6237789	eng	You don't really want to go with us, do you?
6237790	eng	I'm sure Tom will be in a hurry to do that.
6237791	eng	Tom says he definitely wants to do that again.
6237792	eng	You don't really care how I do that, do you?
6237793	eng	I'm sure Tom will be in Boston next Monday.
6237794	eng	Tom says he can't really recall what happened.
6237795	eng	You don't need to do that right now, do you?
6237796	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be handcuffed.
6237797	eng	Tom said you're a better guitarist than he is.
6237798	eng	You don't need to do that every day, do you?
6237799	eng	I'm quite sure Tom has relatives in Boston.
6237800	eng	Tom said there's nothing he can do about that.
6237801	eng	You don't know why I had to do that, do you?
6237802	eng	I'm probably the person Tom is waiting for.
6237803	eng	Tom said there was blood on the kitchen floor.
6237804	eng	You don't have to do that right now, do you?
6237805	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom will vouch for me.
6237806	eng	Tom said the decision was made by a committee.
6237807	eng	You don't have to do that every day, do you?
6237808	eng	I'm glad that Tom didn't ask me to do that.
6237809	eng	Tom said that the judge's decision was unfair.
6237810	eng	You don't have enough time to do that today.
6237811	eng	I'm glad Tom taught me some French phrases.
6237812	eng	Tom said that he'd be glad to do that for you.
6237813	eng	You don't believe I really did that, do you?
6237814	eng	I'd rather do that by myself than with Tom.
6237815	eng	Tom said last night's concert was three hours.
6237816	eng	You didn't want to do that with me, did you?
6237817	eng	I wonder why Tom thought we had to do that.
6237818	eng	Tom said last night's concert was pretty good.
6237819	eng	You didn't seem to be in a hurry to do that.
6237820	eng	I wonder why Tom thought he had to do that.
6237821	eng	Tom said his father told him never to do that.
6237822	eng	You didn't really enjoy doing that, did you?
6237823	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks we need to do that.
6237824	eng	Tom said he's only been to Boston three times.
6237825	eng	You didn't know you had to do that, did you?
6237826	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks we have to do that.
6237827	eng	Tom said he's been trying to do that all week.
6237828	eng	You didn't get a chance to do that, did you?
6237829	eng	I wonder why Tom still drives that old car.
6237830	eng	Tom said he's always been pretty good at math.
6237831	eng	You did that at the last minute, didn't you?
6237832	eng	I wonder if Tom would permit me to do that.
6237833	eng	Tom said he's always been interested in music.
6237834	eng	You could easily have done that by yourself.
6237835	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom about what we did.
6237836	eng	Tom said he'll be at this afternoon's meeting.
6237837	eng	You can stay with us as long as you want to.
6237838	eng	I went to the same kindergarten as Tom did.
6237839	eng	Tom said he'd do that for us if we asked him to.
6237840	eng	You can stay with us as long as you need to.
6237841	eng	I wasn't the one who wanted Tom to do that.
6237842	eng	Tom said he'd be afraid to do that by himself.
6237843	eng	You and I are the only ones who can do that.
6237844	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom had to do that.
6237845	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be able to do that today.
6237846	eng	Wouldn't you like to go to the zoo tomorrow?
6237847	eng	I wasn't sure how to answer Tom's question.
6237848	eng	Tom said he would've done that if he could've.
6237849	eng	Would you mind if I didn't do that tomorrow?
6237850	eng	I wasn't convinced that Tom had to do that.
6237851	eng	Tom said he won't do that unless you help him.
6237852	eng	Would you like to eat dinner on the veranda?
6237853	eng	I was surprised that Tom wanted to do that.
6237854	eng	Tom said he wished you wouldn't do that again.
6237855	eng	Why haven't you done what you said you'd do?
6237856	eng	I was surprised that Tom needed to do that.
6237857	eng	Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
6237858	eng	Why don't you do that before you go home?
6237859	eng	I was lying to Tom when I said I'd do that.
6237860	eng	Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
6237861	eng	Why did you think I didn't enjoy doing that?
6237862	eng	I was in Boston the night Tom was murdered.
6237863	eng	Tom said he was looking forward to doing that.
6237864	eng	Who told you I wouldn't know how to do that?
6237865	eng	I was hoping Tom would be more cooperative.
6237866	eng	Tom said he was going to permit us to do that.
6237867	eng	When are you going to start studying French?
6237868	eng	I wanted to do something to make Tom happy.
6237869	eng	Tom said he wants to do everything by himself.
6237870	eng	What were you afraid of when you were a kid?
6237871	eng	I want to know when Tom is going to Boston.
6237872	eng	Tom said he wanted to be the one who did that.
6237873	eng	Weren't you supposed to do that last Monday?
6237874	eng	I want to know what Tom is doing in Boston.
6237875	eng	Tom said he thought you would want to do that.
6237876	eng	Weren't you supposed to do that by yourself?
6237877	eng	I try to always do the same thing Tom does.
6237878	eng	Tom said he thought it probably wouldn't snow.
6237879	eng	Weren't you supposed to do that before 2:30?
6237880	eng	I tried to get Tom to learn how to do that.
6237881	eng	Tom said he thought he didn't need to do that.
6237882	eng	We've had no snow at all so far this winter.
6237883	eng	I told Tom you'd probably enjoy doing that.
6237884	eng	Tom said he thought he didn't have to do that.
6237885	eng	We've been living in Boston for a long time.
6237886	eng	I told Tom that I thought he could do that.
6237887	eng	Tom said he thought I looked like I was tired.
6237888	eng	We're too smart to do something that stupid.
6237889	eng	I told Tom that I didn't know how to drive.
6237890	eng	Tom said he thinks his team will probably win.
6237891	eng	We won't be staying in Boston for very long.
6237892	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have enough money.
6237893	eng	Tom said he should've stayed in Boston longer.
6237894	eng	We should leave this area as soon as we can.
6237895	eng	I told Tom I'd stay in Boston until Monday.
6237896	eng	Tom said he regretted his decision to do that.
6237897	eng	We should get out of here as soon as we can.
6237898	eng	I told Tom I don't have to do that anymore.
6237899	eng	Tom said he paid thirty dollars for this book.
6237900	eng	We probably won't be in Boston until Monday.
6237901	eng	I thought you said you've seen Tom do that.
6237902	eng	Tom said he needed to find another babysitter.
6237903	eng	We might stay in Boston for a few more days.
6237904	eng	I thought Tom would be up before breakfast.
6237905	eng	Tom said he may go to Boston for Thanksgiving.
6237906	eng	We had to change the locks on all the doors.
6237907	eng	I thought Tom would be in Boston on Monday.
6237908	eng	Tom said he learned how to do that in October.
6237909	eng	We could go see a movie or go out to dinner.
6237910	eng	I thought Tom would be hesitant to do that.
6237911	eng	Tom said he knew he might not need to do that.
6237912	eng	We both have to stay in Boston until Monday.
6237913	eng	I thought Tom would be embarrassed by that.
6237914	eng	Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
6237915	eng	Was it snowing this morning when you got up?
6237916	eng	I thought Tom would be angrier than he was.
6237917	eng	Tom said he hadn't thought about it like that.
6237918	eng	Was it raining this morning when you got up?
6237919	eng	I thought Tom was the first one to do that.
6237920	eng	Tom said he had his reasons for leaving early.
6237921	eng	This is a list of things I need to do today.
6237922	eng	I thought Tom was interested in doing that.
6237923	eng	Tom said he doesn't think you need to do that.
6237924	eng	This evening is the only time I can do that.
6237925	eng	I thought Tom was in his office on Mondays.
6237926	eng	Tom said he doesn't think you have to do that.
6237927	eng	This book seems to be missing several pages.
6237928	eng	I thought Tom was going to win the contest.
6237929	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he needs to do that.
6237930	eng	There's something else I wanted to tell you.
6237931	eng	I thought Tom was going to enjoy the party.
6237932	eng	Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
6237933	eng	There's nothing else I need to do right now.
6237934	eng	I think you could talk Tom into doing that.
6237935	eng	Tom said he doesn't have any plans to do that.
6237936	eng	There's apparently no cure for that disease.
6237937	eng	I think we shouldn't permit Tom to do that.
6237938	eng	Tom said he didn't want to go camping with us.
6237939	eng	There are many ways to remedy the situation.
6237940	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be willing to do that.
6237941	eng	Tom said he didn't want to ask you to do that.
6237942	eng	The road up ahead is blocked by a landslide.
6237943	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be tempted to do that.
6237944	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to do that for him.
6237945	eng	The reason I came here today was to do that.
6237946	eng	I think Tom would like to be in Boston now.
6237947	eng	Tom said he didn't think that really happened.
6237948	eng	The questions on yesterday's exam were easy.
6237949	eng	I think Tom would be happy if you did that.
6237950	eng	Tom said he didn't have to do that by himself.
6237951	eng	The car is all packed and we're ready to go.
6237952	eng	I think Tom would be glad if that happened.
6237953	eng	Tom said he didn't have time to do that today.
6237954	eng	The boy sitting in the corner looked lonely.
6237955	eng	I think Tom won't be here until much later.
6237956	eng	Tom said he didn't have anything he had to do.
6237957	eng	That's a problem we need to deal with today.
6237958	eng	I think Tom won't be awake when I get home.
6237959	eng	Tom said he didn't have any problem with that.
6237960	eng	Please make sure that you do that every day.
6237961	eng	I think Tom will stay in Boston all summer.
6237962	eng	Tom said he didn't feel like doing that today.
6237963	eng	Please let me know before you do that again.
6237964	eng	I think Tom will be doing that again today.
6237965	eng	Tom said he didn't ever want to do that again.
6237966	eng	Only one of my grandmothers is still living.
6237967	eng	I think Tom might've been offended by that.
6237968	eng	Tom said he assumed you would want to do that.
6237969	eng	My sisters will be teachers like our mother.
6237970	eng	I think Tom might go to Boston in the fall.
6237971	eng	Tom said doing that was the right thing to do.
6237972	eng	My parents would never permit me to do that.
6237973	eng	I think Tom isn't the first one to do that.
6237974	eng	Tom recommends that you don't do that anymore.
6237975	eng	My computer is three years older than yours.
6237976	eng	I think Tom is getting tired of doing that.
6237977	eng	Tom really needs to do that as soon as he can.
6237978	eng	Maybe I can go to Boston with you next week.
6237979	eng	I think Tom is difficult to get along with.
6237980	eng	Tom really doesn't want to go to school today.
6237981	eng	Mary picked a flower and put it in her hair.
6237982	eng	I think Tom has to be shown how to do that.
6237983	eng	Tom ran away from home at the age of thirteen.
6237984	eng	Many people don't like going to the dentist.
6237985	eng	I think Tom has never done that by himself.
6237986	eng	Tom promised that he'd do that, but he didn't.
6237987	eng	Many people I didn't know were at the party.
6237988	eng	I think Tom did that, but I could be wrong.
6237989	eng	Tom promised me that he wouldn't go out alone.
6237990	eng	John Lennon's songs are still popular today.
6237991	eng	I think Tom could've been offended by that.
6237992	eng	Tom promised he'd do that before he went home.
6237993	eng	It's been three years since I last did that.
6237994	eng	I think Tom could teach you how to do that.
6237995	eng	Tom probably won't ever need to do that again.
6237996	eng	It's about time we did something about that.
6237997	eng	I think I heard Tom say that he'll do that.
6237998	eng	Tom probably won't ever have to do that again.
6237999	eng	It'll take me a good three hours to do that.
6238000	eng	I sure hope Tom comes to Boston in October.
6238001	eng	Tom probably should do that as soon as he can.
6238002	eng	It would be very insensitive to do that now.
6238003	eng	I should've told Tom not to stay in Boston.
6238004	eng	Tom probably doesn't know anything about this.
6238005	eng	It would be possible to do that by yourself.
6238006	eng	I should've told Tom not to come to Boston.
6238007	eng	Tom probably doesn't know a lot about animals.
6238008	eng	It won't be hard to find someone to do that.
6238009	eng	I should've listened to Tom more carefully.
6238010	eng	Tom probably didn't want to do that yesterday.
6238011	eng	It won't be easy to find someone to do that.
6238012	eng	I should've known better than to trust Tom.
6238013	eng	Tom picked up a rock and threw it at the wolf.
6238014	eng	It should be interesting for you to do that.
6238015	eng	I should've given Tom more time to do that.
6238016	eng	Tom owns an apartment building on Park Street.
6238017	eng	It seems that something strange is going on.
6238018	eng	I should tell Tom that he ought to do that.
6238019	eng	Tom never did have a very good sense of humor.
6238020	eng	It probably won't be interesting to do that.
6238021	eng	I should tell Tom that he needs to do that.
6238022	eng	Tom needs to know the reasons why we did that.
6238023	eng	If you have any questions, ask your teacher.
6238024	eng	I should tell Tom that I intend to do that.
6238025	eng	Tom might be glad that that's going to happen.
6238026	eng	I've never tasted anything like this before.
6238027	eng	I should tell Tom that I don't like my job.
6238028	eng	Tom may also have been in Boston last weekend.
6238029	eng	I've never had the chance to try doing that.
6238030	eng	I should probably tell Tom I won't do that.
6238031	eng	Tom married a girl three years older than him.
6238032	eng	I've been working in Boston for three years.
6238033	eng	I should probably tell Tom I can't do that.
6238034	eng	Tom managed to get out of the pool by himself.
6238036	eng	I should ask Tom for permission to do that.
6238037	eng	Tom looked like he was in a hurry to get home.
6238038	eng	I've asked the same question to many people.
6238039	eng	I saw a woman I didn't know talking to Tom.
6238040	eng	Tom looked around, but he didn't see anything.
6238041	eng	I've already done what I was supposed to do.
6238042	eng	I really don't think Tom wanted to do that.
6238043	eng	Tom knew his plan needed some improvements.
6238044	eng	I've already done everything I needed to do.
6238045	eng	I really don't think Tom needed to do that.
6238046	eng	Tom knew he was supposed to do that yesterday.
6238047	eng	I'm thinking of going to Boston next spring.
6238048	eng	I often help Tom carry water from the well.
6238049	eng	Tom just wants to stay at home in his pajamas.
6238050	eng	I'm the only one who stayed awake all night.
6238051	eng	I never told Tom I wanted to go to Harvard.
6238052	eng	Tom just told people what they needed to know.
6238054	eng	I never told Tom I didn't know how to swim.
6238055	eng	Tom just sat there as if nothing had happened.
6238056	eng	I'm planning to stay in Boston until Monday.
6238057	eng	I might be able to stay in Boston with Tom.
6238058	eng	Tom isn't very likely be fired for doing that.
6238059	eng	I'm not sure if I can do that, but I'll try.
6238060	eng	I lied to Tom when said I wouldn't do that.
6238061	eng	Tom isn't the only one who's going to do that.
6238062	eng	I'm not going to stay in Boston much longer.
6238063	eng	I lied to Tom when I said I didn't do that.
6238064	eng	Tom isn't supposed to be doing that right now.
6238065	eng	I'm not going to do that if I don't have to.
6238066	eng	I know Tom will probably regret doing that.
6238067	eng	Tom isn't likely to figure out how to do that.
6238068	eng	I'm not as good at French as you think I am.
6238069	eng	I know Tom will have to do that on his own.
6238070	eng	Tom isn't going to be very anxious to do that.
6238071	eng	I'm glad I'm not the one who has to do that.
6238072	eng	I know Tom will eventually want to do that.
6238073	eng	Tom is waiting for me in front of the station.
6238074	eng	I'll probably not be in Boston next weekend.
6238075	eng	I know Tom hasn't forgotten how to do that.
6238076	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what we should do.
6238077	eng	I'll buy you one of those for your birthday.
6238078	eng	I knew that Tom wouldn't do that yesterday.
6238079	eng	Tom is trying to figure out what he has to do.
6238080	eng	I'd go to Boston with you if I had the time.
6238081	eng	I knew Tom wouldn't likely have to do that.
6238082	eng	Tom is the only person I know who can do that.
6238083	eng	I'd be very thankful if you did that for me.
6238084	eng	I knew Tom would unlikely agree to do that.
6238085	eng	Tom is the only person here who can do that.
6238086	eng	I'd be very grateful if you did that for me.
6238087	eng	I knew Tom would likely be able to do that.
6238088	eng	Tom is the only person I can trust to do that.
6238089	eng	I'd be grateful if you'd do that for me.
6238090	eng	I hope that Tom doesn't find out the truth.
6238091	eng	Tom is the only one who knows how to fix that.
6238092	eng	I'd be disappointed if I saw you doing that.
6238093	eng	I hope Tom won't tell me I need to do that.
6238094	eng	Tom is the only one who feels like doing that.
6238095	eng	I wish you'd stay in Boston a few more days.
6238096	eng	I hope Tom won't tell me I have to do that.
6238097	eng	Tom is the only one here who has a girlfriend.
6238098	eng	I wish I hadn't forgotten to do my homework.
6238099	eng	I hope Tom doesn't say he wants to do that.
6238100	eng	Tom is the only one here permitted to do that.
6238101	eng	I wasn't wearing socks, so my feet got cold.
6238102	eng	I hope Tom doesn't say he needs to do that.
6238103	eng	Tom is saving money so he can buy a motorboat.
6238104	eng	I wasn't the only one who wanted to do that.
6238105	eng	I have a feeling that Tom ought to do that.
6238106	eng	Tom is one of the nicest kid I've ever taught.
6238107	eng	I wasn't the only one who needed to do that.
6238108	eng	I have a feeling that Tom needs to do that.
6238109	eng	Tom is one of the best athletes in our school.
6238110	eng	I wasn't the first one to decide to do that.
6238111	eng	I have a feeling Tom won't want to do that.
6238112	eng	Tom is looking forward to doing that with you.
6238113	eng	I wasn't convinced that I needed to do that.
6238114	eng	I have a feeling Tom will enjoy doing that.
6238115	eng	Tom is likely to still be hesitant to do that.
6238116	eng	I wasn't able to do that until I was thirty.
6238117	eng	I hate Tom, but not as much as he hates me.
6238118	eng	Tom is likely to be unenthusiastic about that.
6238119	eng	I wasn't able to do that because I was sick.
6238120	eng	I feel sure that Tom has already done that.
6238121	eng	Tom is likely to be troubled by what happened.
6238122	eng	I wasn't able to do anything I wanted to do.
6238123	eng	I doubt that Tom will be home this evening.
6238124	eng	Tom is likely to be through doing that by now.
6238125	eng	I want to know when you're going to do that.
6238126	eng	I doubt that I can prove that Tom did that.
6238127	eng	Tom is likely to be amused by what's going on.
6238128	eng	I want to know how you're going to get here.
6238129	eng	I doubt if Tom will be hesitant to do that.
6238130	eng	Tom is likely to be able to manage to do that.
6238131	eng	I used to speak French better than I do now.
6238132	eng	I don't want to tell you how Tom and I met.
6238133	eng	Tom is gradually getting better at doing that.
6238134	eng	I used to come to Boston about once a month.
6238135	eng	I don't want to help Tom with his homework.
6238136	eng	Tom is good at practically everything he does.
6238137	eng	I understand that you've started doing that.
6238138	eng	I don't want to do that without Tom's help.
6238139	eng	Tom is fortunate that he's allowed to do that.
6238140	eng	I thought you were interested in doing that.
6238141	eng	I don't think they'll allow Tom to do that.
6238142	eng	Tom is better this year than he was last year.
6238143	eng	I thought you were going to win the contest.
6238144	eng	I don't think it's safe for Tom to do that.
6238145	eng	Tom initially said he wasn't going to do that.
6238146	eng	I thought you said you'd stopped doing that.
6238147	eng	I don't think Tom would do that by himself.
6238148	eng	Tom hurt his elbow when he slipped on the ice.
6238149	eng	I thought you said you regretted doing that.
6238150	eng	I don't think Tom would care if I did that.
6238151	eng	Tom hopes he'll get a chance to do that again.
6238152	eng	I thought you didn't to know how to do that.
6238153	eng	I don't think Tom would be able to do that.
6238154	eng	Tom hasn't yet given me permission to do that.
6238155	eng	I thought perhaps more people would do that.
6238156	eng	I don't think Tom will be ready to do that.
6238157	eng	Tom hasn't been back to Boston in a long time.
6238158	eng	I thought I'd come up with the perfect plan.
6238159	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that today.
6238160	eng	Tom has to make a speech at the party tonight.
6238161	eng	I thought I'd be through doing that by 2:30.
6238162	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that again.
6238163	eng	Tom has the same kind of computer as you have.
6238164	eng	I thought I might not be allowed to do that.
6238165	eng	I don't think Tom will allow me to do that.
6238166	eng	Tom has spent more than three years in prison.
6238167	eng	I think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
6238168	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that anymore.
6238169	eng	Tom has finally done what he promised he'd do.
6238170	eng	I think it's probably impossible to do that.
6238171	eng	I don't think Tom really wanted to do that.
6238172	eng	Tom has enough time to do that if he wants to.
6238173	eng	I think it's little too late to do that now.
6238174	eng	I don't think Tom really needed to do that.
6238175	eng	Tom has enough money to buy whatever he wants.
6238176	eng	I think it wouldn't be dangerous to do that.
6238177	eng	I don't think Tom really enjoys doing that.
6238178	eng	Tom has enough money to buy whatever he needs.
6238179	eng	I think doing that would be too hard for me.
6238180	eng	I don't think Tom ought to do that anymore.
6238181	eng	Tom has done that more times than I can count.
6238182	eng	I think I'm not supposed to do that anymore.
6238183	eng	I don't really think Tom wanted to do that.
6238184	eng	Tom has done a good job for us here in Boston.
6238185	eng	I suggest not going to Boston in the winter.
6238186	eng	I don't really think Tom needed to do that.
6238187	eng	Tom has been told to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6238188	eng	I still get to Boston at least once a month.
6238189	eng	I don't need Tom to tell me how to do that.
6238190	eng	Tom has been one of my best friends for years.
6238191	eng	I spilled some juice while I was pouring it.
6238192	eng	I don't need Tom to do that for me anymore.
6238193	eng	Tom has been living in Boston for a few years.
6238194	eng	I shouldn't have dropped out of high school.
6238195	eng	I don't like Boston and Tom doesn't either.
6238196	eng	Tom has been doing that for a year and a half.
6238197	eng	I should've known that I couldn't trust you.
6238198	eng	I don't know why Tom dropped out of school.
6238199	eng	Tom has been doing that for a number of years.
6238200	eng	I should've done that when I had the chance.
6238201	eng	I don't know who Tom wants to do that with.
6238202	eng	Tom has been building houses for thirty years.
6238203	eng	I should've done that the way you suggested.
6238204	eng	I don't know whether Tom was hungry or not.
6238205	eng	Tom has also studied French for several years.
6238206	eng	I should be able to get that done by Monday.
6238207	eng	I don't know whether Tom likes dogs or not.
6238208	eng	Tom has already told me what needs to be done.
6238209	eng	I really want to go to the concert with you.
6238210	eng	I don't know whether Tom is thirsty or not.
6238211	eng	Tom has already told me what I needed to know.
6238212	eng	I really want to be able to do that someday.
6238213	eng	I don't know where Tom usually goes skiing.
6238214	eng	Tom happened to be on the same train as I was.
6238215	eng	I realized I didn't have to do that anymore.
6238216	eng	I don't know where Tom bought his computer.
6238217	eng	Tom gave me a nice umbrella, but I've lost it.
6238218	eng	I promised my parents that I'd study French.
6238219	eng	I don't know the reason why Tom was crying.
6238220	eng	Tom fell asleep while he was watching a movie.
6238221	eng	I probably won't ever have to do that again.
6238222	eng	I don't know how much more money Tom wants.
6238223	eng	Tom expects you to do that before you go home.
6238224	eng	I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
6238225	eng	I don't feel like talking to Tom right now.
6238226	eng	Tom enjoys going to the beach with his family.
6238227	eng	I plan to go to Boston the month after next.
6238228	eng	I don't believe Tom can do that by himself.
6238229	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that as much as you do.
6238230	eng	I might not go to Boston with you on Monday.
6238231	eng	I didn't want to hang out with Tom anymore.
6238232	eng	Tom doesn't think we're capable of doing that.
6238233	eng	I might go to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6238234	eng	I didn't want to go to the circus with Tom.
6238235	eng	Tom doesn't think they'll allow me to do that.
6238236	eng	I may be able to come to Boston next Monday.
6238237	eng	I didn't think that Tom would do that, too.
6238238	eng	Tom doesn't think it would be wise to do that.
6238239	eng	I know I won't be able to do that by myself.
6238240	eng	I didn't think Tom would forget to do that.
6238241	eng	Tom doesn't think he'll be allowed to do that.
6238242	eng	I know I shouldn't have done that by myself.
6238243	eng	I didn't think Tom was finished doing that.
6238244	eng	Tom doesn't take anything for granted anymore.
6238245	eng	I know I don't have anything to worry about.
6238246	eng	I didn't think Tom needed to do that again.
6238247	eng	Tom doesn't seem to enjoy reading comic books.
6238248	eng	I knew I didn't have enough time to do that.
6238249	eng	I didn't think Tom had ever been to Boston.
6238250	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be a student here anymore.
6238251	eng	I intend to move to Boston after I graduate.
6238252	eng	I didn't tell Tom why he needed to do that.
6238253	eng	Tom doesn't look like he's having a good time.
6238254	eng	I hope that I don't have to do that anymore.
6238255	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I enjoyed doing that.
6238256	eng	Tom doesn't like watching late night TV shows.
6238257	eng	I hope that I can visit Boston before I die.
6238258	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I grew up in Boston.
6238259	eng	Tom doesn't know whether he'll do that or not.
6238260	eng	I have a feeling that I've done this before.
6238261	eng	I didn't tell Tom how much money I'd spent.
6238262	eng	Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that.
6238263	eng	I hadn't intended to stay in Boston so long.
6238264	eng	I didn't tell Tom anything about the party.
6238265	eng	Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that anymore.
6238266	eng	I found that it's very difficult to do that.
6238267	eng	I didn't realize that Tom couldn't do that.
6238268	eng	Tom doesn't come to Boston very often anymore.
6238269	eng	I doubt if it would be dangerous to do that.
6238270	eng	I didn't realize Tom had already done that.
6238271	eng	Tom doesn't care whether he does that or not.
6238272	eng	I don't want to study French, but I have to.
6238273	eng	I didn't realize I had to help Tom do that.
6238274	eng	Tom doesn't believe he can do that by himself.
6238275	eng	I don't want to be the first one to do that.
6238276	eng	I didn't need to use the knife Tom lent me.
6238277	eng	Tom died less than a week after his operation.
6238278	eng	I don't want to be alone on Valentine's Day.
6238279	eng	I didn't let my children go to Tom's party.
6238280	eng	Tom didn't think you'd be able to do that.
6238281	eng	I don't want the same thing to happen to me.
6238282	eng	I didn't let Tom finish what he was saying.
6238283	eng	Tom didn't tell me whether or not he did that.
6238284	eng	I don't want the same thing to happen again.
6238285	eng	I didn't know why Tom wanted me to do that.
6238286	eng	Tom didn't start playing the banjo until 2013.
6238287	eng	I don't usually stop if the light's yellow.
6238288	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was tired or not.
6238289	eng	Tom didn't seem to be having such a good time.
6238290	eng	I don't understand what you expect me to do.
6238291	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was happy or not.
6238292	eng	Tom didn't know that what he'd done was wrong.
6238293	eng	I don't think you should be doing that here.
6238294	eng	I didn't know where Tom was planning to go.
6238295	eng	Tom didn't know that I wasn't able to do that.
6238296	eng	I don't think they'll permit you to do that.
6238297	eng	I didn't know where Tom had parked the car.
6238298	eng	Tom didn't know that I didn't want to do that.
6238299	eng	I don't think that doing that is a bad idea.
6238300	eng	I didn't know when Tom was going to arrive.
6238301	eng	Tom didn't know he wasn't supposed to do that.
6238302	eng	I don't think it's smart for you to do that.
6238303	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom did that.
6238304	eng	Tom didn't have the time to do that yesterday.
6238305	eng	I don't think it's silly for you to do that.
6238306	eng	I didn't know that Tom was studying French.
6238307	eng	Tom didn't have many opportunities to do that.
6238308	eng	I don't think it would be unsafe to do that.
6238309	eng	I didn't know that Tom was in love with me.
6238310	eng	Tom didn't hang out with us yesterday evening.
6238311	eng	I don't think it would be stupid to do that.
6238312	eng	I didn't know that Tom was already married.
6238313	eng	Tom didn't get here until 2:30 in the morning.
6238314	eng	I don't think doing that would be dangerous.
6238315	eng	I didn't know that Tom was able to do that.
6238316	eng	Tom didn't expect to be able to do that again.
6238317	eng	I don't think I've ever done that by myself.
6238318	eng	I didn't know that Tom knew how to do that.
6238319	eng	Tom didn't do a very good job washing the car.
6238320	eng	I don't think I'll have a chance to do that.
6238321	eng	I didn't know that Tom had so many friends.
6238322	eng	Tom decided to walk instead of taking the bus.
6238323	eng	I don't think I'll be able to do that again.
6238324	eng	I didn't know that Tom had an older sister.
6238325	eng	Tom decided he was the one who should do that.
6238326	eng	I don't think I have the stamina to do that.
6238327	eng	I didn't know how to answer Tom's question.
6238328	eng	Tom could possibly be nervous, but I doubt it.
6238329	eng	I don't think I have the ability to do that.
6238330	eng	I didn't know how much money Tom had spent.
6238331	eng	Tom can't do that alone. You need to help him.
6238332	eng	I don't really want to go swimming with you.
6238333	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't want to do that.
6238334	eng	Tom can't do that alone. You have to help him.
6238335	eng	I don't really feel like doing that anymore.
6238336	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't need to do that.
6238337	eng	Tom came over to my house yesterday afternoon.
6238338	eng	I don't play the trombone as well as you do.
6238339	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't have to do that.
6238340	eng	Tom began writing poetry when he was thirteen.
6238341	eng	I don't play tennis as often as I'd like to.
6238342	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that on time.
6238343	eng	Tom assured us that he wouldn't do that again.
6238344	eng	I don't often have a chance to speak French.
6238345	eng	I didn't know Tom would eventually do that.
6238346	eng	Tom assured me that he wouldn't do that again.
6238347	eng	I don't need to wear a suit and tie to work.
6238348	eng	I didn't know Tom would do that so quickly.
6238349	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to do that with him.
6238350	eng	I don't like it when people keep me waiting.
6238351	eng	I didn't know Tom was the one who did that.
6238352	eng	Tom asked me if I'd like to do that on Monday.
6238353	eng	I don't like girls who wear a lot of makeup.
6238354	eng	I didn't know Tom thought I should do that.
6238355	eng	Tom and I've known each other for a long time.
6238356	eng	I don't know why I was expelled from school.
6238357	eng	I didn't know Tom spoke French so fluently.
6238358	eng	Tom and I've decided to go to Boston together.
6238359	eng	I don't know where the fire extinguisher is.
6238360	eng	I didn't know Tom had to do that yesterday.
6238361	eng	Tom and I'll be playing tennis this afternoon.
6238362	eng	I don't know how long the meeting will last.
6238363	eng	I didn't know Tom had spent time in prison.

6238367	eng	Tom and I went to the mall together on Monday.
6238368	eng	I don't have to wear a suit and tie to work.
6238369	eng	I didn't do everything Tom wanted me to do.
6238370	eng	Tom and I used to work in the same department.
6238371	eng	I don't have to go there if I don't want to.
6238372	eng	I didn't ask Tom for permission to do that.
6238373	eng	Tom and I used to sing country music together.
6238374	eng	I don't feel like eating anything right now.
6238375	eng	I did that as soon as Tom told me I had to.
6238376	eng	Tom and I used to ride the same bus to school.
6238377	eng	I don't do that the same way most people do.
6238378	eng	I did basically the same thing as Tom did.
6238379	eng	Tom and I used to be in the same French class.
6238380	eng	I don't care what other people say about me.
6238381	eng	I can't remember how to get to Tom's house.
6238382	eng	Tom and I see each other at least once a week.
6238383	eng	I don't brush my teeth as often as I should.
6238385	eng	Tom and I sat next to each other on the train.
6238386	eng	I don't always get my homework done on time.
6238387	eng	I can't believe Tom isn't going to do that.
6238388	eng	Tom and I sat next to each other on the plane.
6238389	eng	I do want to do that at least one more time.
6238390	eng	I assume Tom would be reluctant to do that.
6238391	eng	Tom and I sat next to each other on the couch.
6238392	eng	I didn't want to talk about my private life.
6238393	eng	I asked Tom whether he wanted to go or not.
6238394	eng	Tom and I often speak to each other in French.
6238395	eng	I didn't want to study French, but I had to.
6238396	eng	How many weeks will it take Tom to do that?
6238397	eng	Tom and I often go mountain climbing together.
6238398	eng	I didn't want to spend that much for a meal.

6238400	eng	Tom and I live in the same apartment building.
6238401	eng	I didn't want to go to Boston, but I had to.
6238403	eng	Tom and I have decided never to do that again.
6238404	eng	I didn't want to do that as much as you did.
6238405	eng	How many hours will it take Tom to do that?
6238406	eng	Tom and I have a farm not too far from Boston.
6238407	eng	I didn't want to be the last one to do that.
6238408	eng	How long has Tom been working as carpenter?
6238409	eng	Tom and I hardly ever see each other nowadays.
6238410	eng	I didn't want the same thing to happen here.
6238411	eng	How did you know which bus Tom would be on?
6238412	eng	Tom and I got married when we were very young.
6238413	eng	I didn't think you'd be in Boston this week.
6238414	eng	How did you know that Tom was lying to you?
6238415	eng	Tom and I eat lunch together almost every day.
6238416	eng	I didn't think you'd be embarrassed by that.
6238417	eng	Has Tom ever criticized you for doing that?
6238418	eng	Tom and I don't talk to each other very often.
6238419	eng	I didn't think the meeting would be so long.
6238420	eng	Everything that's happening is Tom's fault.
6238421	eng	Tom and I don't know what we ought to do next.
6238422	eng	I didn't think doing that would be much fun.
6238423	eng	Even though it's Monday today, Tom is here.
6238424	eng	Tom and I don't do that as much as we used to.
6238425	eng	I didn't stand a chance of getting that job.
6238426	eng	Don't forget to put Tom's name on the list.
6238427	eng	Tom and I do that together as often as we can.
6238428	eng	I didn't lose as much weight as I wanted to.
6238429	eng	Does Tom stay with you when he's in Boston?
6238430	eng	Tom and I didn't know each other at that time.
6238431	eng	I didn't learn anything new at school today.
6238432	eng	Do you want me to get Tom to do that today?
6238433	eng	Tom and I decided to drive to Boston together.
6238434	eng	I didn't know what to do when that happened.
6238435	eng	Do you think Tom would be quiet doing that?
6238436	eng	Tom and I are thinking about getting divorced.
6238437	eng	I didn't know that I didn't need to do that.
6238438	eng	Do you think Tom would be happy doing that?
6238439	eng	Tom and I are still not talking to each other.
6238440	eng	I didn't know that I didn't have to do that.
6238441	eng	Do you think Tom will permit us to do that?
6238442	eng	Tom and I are no longer married to each other.
6238443	eng	I didn't know how to answer those questions.
6238444	eng	Do you know where Tom has been all morning?

6238448	eng	Tom and I are going swimming tomorrow morning.
6238450	eng	Do you know if Tom is permitted to do that?
6238451	eng	Tom and I almost always agree with each other.
6238452	eng	I didn't know I no longer needed to do that.
6238453	eng	Didn't you know that Tom wanted to do that?
6238454	eng	Tom Jackson didn't run for reelection in 2013.
6238455	eng	I didn't have the time to do that yesterday.
6238456	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to work in Boston?
6238457	eng	Tom's still just a kid, so let's forgive him.
6238458	eng	I didn't have many opportunities to do that.
6238459	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to live in Boston?
6238460	eng	Tom's salary has more than doubled in a year.
6238461	eng	I didn't have anything else I wanted to say.
6238462	eng	Didn't you know Tom owns more than one car?
6238463	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if we made him do that.
6238464	eng	I didn't get here until 2:30 in the morning.
6238465	eng	Didn't you know Tom is actually very smart?
6238466	eng	Tom would've wanted to go to Boston with you.
6238467	eng	I didn't expect to be able to do that again.
6238468	eng	Didn't you know Tom had to get a visa, too?
6238469	eng	Tom would've been happy if you'd done that.
6238470	eng	I didn't expect the meeting to last so long.
6238471	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't want to do that?
6238472	eng	Tom worked in Boston until his death in 2013.
6238473	eng	I didn't do that as quickly as I usually do.
6238474	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't need to do that?
6238475	eng	Tom won't likely ever be that careless again.
6238476	eng	I didn't do anything you wouldn't have done.
6238477	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't like to do that?
6238478	eng	Tom won't likely be up at this time of night.
6238479	eng	I didn't buy everything you asked me to buy.
6238480	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't like doing that?
6238481	eng	Tom won't likely be the first one to do that.
6238482	eng	I decided to walk instead of taking the bus.
6238483	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't have to do that?
6238484	eng	Tom won't likely be interested in doing that.
6238485	eng	I can continue to do that if you want me to.
6238486	eng	Didn't you know Tom and John were brothers?
6238487	eng	Tom won't find it so easy to do that anymore.
6238488	eng	I ate about the same amount as I usually do.
6238489	eng	Did you know that Tom was going to do that?
6238490	eng	Tom won't be able to do that while he's sick.
6238491	eng	I always thought I'd eventually get married.
6238492	eng	Did you know that Tom was going to be here?

6238496	eng	Tom will stay in the hospital until tomorrow.
6238497	eng	I actually spoke French to my teacher today.

6238500	eng	How often do you forget to do your homework?
6238501	eng	Did you know Tom was living on Park Street?

6238503	eng	How often do you change your guitar strings?
6238504	eng	Did you know Tom spent over $3,000 on that?

6238506	eng	How many years ago was it that you did that?
6238507	eng	Did you know Tom before he joined the team?
6238508	eng	Tom will probably be the next one to do that.
6238509	eng	How many seconds did it take you to do that?
6238510	eng	Can Tom stay in Boston with us next summer?
6238511	eng	Tom will probably be the last one to do that.
6238513	eng	Ask Tom if he wants to go swimming with us.
6238514	eng	Tom will probably be irritated by that noise.
6238515	eng	How many more years will we need to do that?
6238516	eng	Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
6238517	eng	Tom will probably be forgiven for doing that.
6238518	eng	How many more years will we have to do that?
6238519	eng	All three of Tom's ex-wives live in Boston.

6238527	eng	How many minutes did it take you to do that?
6238528	eng	You've already paid Tom back, haven't you?
6238529	eng	Tom went to a conference in Boston last week.
6238531	eng	You're not going to let Tom swim, are you?
6238532	eng	Tom went out for a walk in spite of the rain.
6238533	eng	How many foreign students are in your class?
6238534	eng	You'll try to help Tom do that, won't you?
6238535	eng	Tom wasn't the only one permitted to do that.
6238536	eng	How many cups of coffee do you drink a week?
6238537	eng	You'll tell Tom how to do that, won't you?
6238538	eng	Tom was the first one to get up this morning.
6238539	eng	How many bags of marshmallows did you bring?
6238540	eng	You'll show Tom how to do that, won't you?
6238541	eng	Tom was taller than me when we were thirteen.
6238542	eng	Have you ever been to a beach in the winter?
6238543	eng	You warned Tom not to do that, didn't you?
6238544	eng	Tom was only given thirty minutes to do that.
6238545	eng	From now on, I'm going to do that every day.
6238546	eng	You told Tom that I'd do that, didn't you?
6238547	eng	Tom was my saxophone teacher for three years.
6238548	eng	Don't you think it would be wise to do that?
6238549	eng	You told Tom he could do that, didn't you?
6238550	eng	Tom was in his office just a few minutes ago.
6238551	eng	Don't you think it would be safe to do that?
6238552	eng	You told Tom I didn't do that, didn't you?
6238553	eng	Tom was able to do that without any problems.
6238554	eng	Don't you think it would be easy to do that?
6238555	eng	You thought Tom would do that, didn't you?
6238556	eng	Tom wanted to do that even more than you did.
6238557	eng	Don't forget that you need to do that today.
6238558	eng	You think I'll do that for Tom, don't you?
6238559	eng	Tom usually does his homework in the kitchen.
6238560	eng	Don't forget that you have to do that today.
6238561	eng	You shouldn't have allowed Tom to do that.
6238562	eng	Tom used to work as a freelance photographer.
6238563	eng	Doing that was a very impulsive thing to do.
6238564	eng	You shouldn't do that until Tom gets here.
6238565	eng	Tom used to have a restaurant on Park Street.
6238566	eng	Doing that likely won't be very interesting.
6238567	eng	You should try to get Tom to do that, too.
6238568	eng	Tom used to go to Boston three times a month.
6238569	eng	Do your parents still permit you to do that?
6238570	eng	You should do that the way Tom showed you.
6238571	eng	Tom used the money I gave him to buy a bicycle.
6238572	eng	Do you think you'll finish doing that today?
6238573	eng	You like the way Tom does that, don't you?
6238574	eng	Tom took out his wallet and paid the cashier.
6238575	eng	Do you think you'd ever consider doing that?
6238576	eng	You know why Tom is doing that, don't you?
6238577	eng	Tom told us that doing that wasn't necessary.
6238578	eng	Do you think it's safe to cross this bridge?
6238579	eng	You hope that Tom will do that, don't you?
6238580	eng	Tom told me why it was a bad idea to do that.
6238581	eng	Do you still eat out as much as you used to?
6238582	eng	You don't think Tom would do that, do you?
6238583	eng	Tom told me that you're a compulsive gambler.
6238584	eng	Do you still do that as much as you used to?
6238585	eng	You don't know where Tom did that, do you?
6238586	eng	Tom told me that he's immune to that disease.
6238587	eng	Do you really think it's foolish to do that?
6238588	eng	You didn't remind Tom to do that, did you?
6238589	eng	Tom told me that he wouldn't do that anymore.
6238590	eng	Do you plan to stay in Boston for very long?
6238591	eng	You can likely talk Tom out of doing that.
6238592	eng	Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
6238593	eng	Do you know anyone who has gotten a divorce?
6238594	eng	You asked Tom why he did that, didn't you?
6238595	eng	Tom told me that I'm excused from doing that.
6238596	eng	Do you intend to stay in Boston for a while?
6238597	eng	You and Tom did that together, didn't you?
6238598	eng	Tom told me not to waste my time watching TV.
6238599	eng	Do you have many friends who don't eat meat?
6238600	eng	Would Tom still be able to do that for us?
6238601	eng	Tom told me it would be dangerous to do that.
6238602	eng	Do you have any objections to my doing that?
6238603	eng	Why don't you get Tom to help you do that?
6238604	eng	Tom told me how proud he was of his children.
6238605	eng	Do you come to Boston more than once a year?
6238606	eng	Why don't you get Tom to buy that for you?
6238607	eng	Tom told me he wasn't planning on doing that.
6238608	eng	Didn't you know Mary and Alice were sisters?
6238609	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't want to do that?
6238610	eng	Tom told me he was just trying to be helpful.
6238611	eng	Did you really not go to Boston last summer?
6238612	eng	Who told you Tom would be able to do that?
6238613	eng	Tom told me I didn't have to do that anymore.
6238614	eng	Did you know that your brake lights are out?
6238615	eng	Who told you Tom wasn't going to be fired?
6238616	eng	Tom thinks that doing that isn't a good idea.
6238617	eng	Did you finish reading that book last night?
6238618	eng	Who told you Tom couldn't ride a unicycle?
6238619	eng	Tom thinks some of his friends could do that.
6238620	eng	Can you tell me exactly what you want to do?
6238621	eng	What did you do that made Tom yell at you?
6238622	eng	Tom still just wants to stay at home all day.
6238623	eng	Can you tell me exactly what you need to do?
6238624	eng	We don't have to tell Tom why we did that.
6238625	eng	Tom still hasn't told me what he plans to do.
6238626	eng	Can you tell me exactly what you have to do?
6238627	eng	Wasn't Tom supposed to do that by himself?
6238628	eng	Tom still has a lot of things he wants to do.
6238629	eng	Can you tell me exactly what has to be done?
6238630	eng	Was it you who told Tom he should do that?
6238631	eng	Tom still has a lot of things he needs to do.
6238632	eng	As far as I know, I've never eaten dog meat.
6238633	eng	Was it you who told Tom he has to do that?
6238634	eng	Tom still doesn't know why he has to do that.
6238635	eng	Are either of your grandfathers still alive?
6238636	eng	Was it you who told Tom he had to do that?
6238637	eng	Tom spent a lot of time studying last summer.
6238638	eng	All three of us knew what needed to be done.
6238639	eng	Was Tom really able to do that by himself?
6238640	eng	Tom spent a lot of time doing that yesterday.
6238641	eng	About how many days will it take to do that?
6238642	eng	These books were recommended to me by Tom.
6238643	eng	Tom spends a lot of his free time doing that.
6238644	eng	About how many days does it take to do that?
6238645	eng	There was nothing Tom could do about that.
6238646	eng	Tom sometimes helps me with my math homework.
6238647	eng	"Have you done that already?" "No, not yet."
6238648	eng	The teacher caught Tom cheating on a test.
6238649	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that in such a hurry.
6238650	eng	"Have you already done that?" "No, not yet."
6238651	eng	The cut on Tom's leg seems to have healed.
6238652	eng	Tom shouldn't have been permitted to do that.
6238653	eng	"Did you do that on Monday?" "No, I didn't."
6238654	eng	Tell Tom he should do that this afternoon.
6238655	eng	Tom should've waited until Monday to do that.
6238656	eng	You've grown since the last time I saw you.
6238657	eng	Since Tom is sick, he can't do that today.
6238658	eng	Tom should probably not have done that again.
6238659	eng	You've decided not to do that, haven't you?
6238660	eng	Please tell Tom that I'll do that for him.
6238661	eng	Tom should only miss a week or two of school.
6238662	eng	You're too young to get a driver's license.
6238663	eng	Please tell Tom not to do that by himself.
6238664	eng	Tom should be present at next week's meeting.
6238665	eng	You're the only one who doesn't seem happy.
6238666	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to do that today.
6238667	eng	Tom should be allowed to go home early today.
6238668	eng	You're the only one who doesn't look tired.
6238669	eng	Please remind me to remind Tom to do that.
6238670	eng	Tom should be able to do that in three hours.
6238671	eng	You're the only one who doesn't look happy.
6238672	eng	Please find out when Tom wants to do that.
6238673	eng	Tom should be able to do that better than me.
6238674	eng	You're the one I want to go to Boston with.
6238675	eng	Please find out when Tom plans to do that.
6238676	eng	Tom seems to be aware of what he needs to do.
6238677	eng	You're not the only one who should do that.
6238678	eng	Please find out when Tom plans to be here.
6238679	eng	Tom seems convinced that he needs to do that.
6238680	eng	You're not the only one who didn't do that.
6238681	eng	Please don't do that until Tom gets there.
6238682	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what was happening.
6238683	eng	You're not the easiest person to live with.
6238684	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't write letters anymore.
6238685	eng	Tom seemed to be amused by what was going on.
6238686	eng	You're much taller than I thought you'd be.
6238687	eng	My guess is that Tom will want to do that.
6238688	eng	Tom says that more research needs to be done.
6238689	eng	You're a very secretive person, aren't you?
6238690	eng	My guess is that Tom will need to do that.
6238691	eng	Tom says it's little too late to do that now.
6238692	eng	You're a regular customer here, aren't you?
6238693	eng	My guess is that Tom will have to do that.
6238694	eng	Tom says he's already decided not to do that.
6238695	eng	You're a professional musician, aren't you?
6238696	eng	Maybe Tom would enjoy doing that with you.
6238697	eng	Tom says he'll be present at today's meeting.
6238698	eng	You're a native French speaker, aren't you?
6238699	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what he has to buy.
6238700	eng	Tom says he'd rather do that some other time.
6238701	eng	You're a friend of my sister's, aren't you?
6238702	eng	Let's go over to Tom's place and help him.
6238703	eng	Tom says he won't be bullied into doing that.
6238704	eng	You'll be here to do that later, won't you?
6238705	eng	Let's go over to Tom's house and help him.
6238706	eng	Tom says he thinks he can do that by himself.
6238707	eng	You'd like to see me do that, wouldn't you?
6238708	eng	It's been three months since Tom did that.
6238709	eng	Tom says he saw people running and screaming.
6238710	eng	You won't be permitted to do that anywhere.
6238711	eng	It'll probably be safe for Tom to do that.
6238712	eng	Tom says he doesn't think you should do that.
6238713	eng	You won't actually be doing that, will you?
6238714	eng	It'll probably be easy for Tom to do that.
6238715	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he'll ever do that.
6238716	eng	You weren't the one who did that, were you?
6238717	eng	It would be impossible for Tom to do that.
6238718	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can do that now.
6238719	eng	You were the one who did that, weren't you?
6238720	eng	It would be disappointing if Tom did that.
6238721	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what he ought to do.
6238722	eng	You were motivated to do that, weren't you?
6238723	eng	It was very insensitive of Tom to do that.
6238724	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what he needs to do.
6238725	eng	You were in Boston last month, weren't you?
6238726	eng	It sounds like Tom won't be here tomorrow.
6238727	eng	Tom says he doesn't have time to do that now.
6238728	eng	You were desperate to do that, weren't you?
6238729	eng	It sounds like Tom didn't want to do that.
6238731	eng	You want to know why I did that, don't you?
6238732	eng	It sounds like Tom didn't need to do that.
6238733	eng	Tom says he didn't know he needed to do that.
6238734	eng	You used to be a heroin addict, didn't you?
6238735	eng	It sounds like Tom didn't have to do that.
6238736	eng	Tom says everything's back to the way it was.
6238737	eng	You used to be a forest ranger, didn't you?
6238738	eng	It looks like Tom is doing that right now.
6238739	eng	Tom said yesterday's meeting was interesting.
6238740	eng	You think I'd regret doing that, don't you?
6238741	eng	It looks like Tom doesn't want to do that.
6238742	eng	Tom said we were supposed to do that as well.
6238743	eng	You think I should've done that, don't you?
6238744	eng	It looks like Tom doesn't know what to do.
6238745	eng	Tom said they wouldn't permit him to do that.
6238746	eng	You studied hard for the test, didn't you?
6238747	eng	Is there any chance that Tom will do that?
6238748	eng	Tom said they would be postponing the picnic.
6238749	eng	You shouldn't have been allowed to do that.
6238750	eng	Is there any chance Tom is doing that now?
6238751	eng	Tom said there wasn't enough time to do that.
6238752	eng	You should've been the last one to do that.
6238753	eng	Is Tom still be willing to do that for us?
6238754	eng	Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
6238755	eng	You should've been forgiven for doing that.
6238756	eng	I've spoken in French with Tom many times.
6238757	eng	Tom said the passengers' injuries were minor.
6238758	eng	You should've been excused from doing that.
6238759	eng	I'm the only one who ever really knew Tom.
6238760	eng	Tom said the fundraising event was a success.
6238761	eng	You should've been able to do that as well.
6238762	eng	I'm the one who showed Tom how to do that.
6238763	eng	Tom said that's not likely to happen anymore.
6238764	eng	You should stay in Boston for another week.
6238765	eng	I'm sure that Tom won't forget to do that.
6238766	eng	Tom said that probably wouldn't happen again.
6238767	eng	You should do that before it gets too late.
6238768	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be hesitant to do that.
6238769	eng	Tom said that he'd do that as soon as he can.
6238770	eng	You should consider not doing that anymore.
6238771	eng	I'm sure Tom will be reluctant to do that.
6238772	eng	Tom said that he wasn't playing golf anymore.
6238773	eng	You seemed to be in a big hurry to do that.
6238774	eng	I'm sure Tom will be awake before you are.
6238775	eng	Tom said that he wasn't able to walk anymore.
6238776	eng	You seemed convinced that I had to do that.
6238777	eng	I'm sure Tom has other things on his mind.
6238778	eng	Tom said that he wanted to borrow some money.
6238779	eng	You seem to know what you're talking about.
6238780	eng	I'm not the one who wanted Tom to do that.
6238781	eng	Tom said that he needed to borrow some money.
6238782	eng	You seem to be reluctant to do that for us.
6238783	eng	I'm absolutely sure that's what Tom wants.
6238784	eng	Tom said it wasn't the right time to do that.
6238785	eng	You said you wanted me to buy that for you.
6238786	eng	I'm absolutely sure that's what Tom needs.
6238788	eng	You really didn't want to do that, did you?
6238789	eng	I'd be disappointed if Tom didn't do that.
6238790	eng	Tom said his house wasn't in a good location.
6238791	eng	You promised us you wouldn't do that again.
6238792	eng	I wouldn't help Tom do that if I were you.
6238793	eng	Tom said he's really glad he moved to Boston.
6238794	eng	You need to do that more quickly next time.
6238795	eng	I wouldn't dream of asking Tom to do that.
6238796	eng	Tom said he's been trying to do that all day.
6238797	eng	You need to do that before you can go home.
6238798	eng	I wouldn't do that that way if I were Tom.
6238799	eng	Tom said he'd rather do that some other time.
6238800	eng	You need to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6238801	eng	I wonder why Tom thought I had to do that.
6238803	eng	You look like you were half expecting this.
6238804	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks I need to do that.
6238805	eng	Tom said he'd be embarrassed to do that here.
6238806	eng	You look exactly the same as you always do.
6238807	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks I have to do that.
6238808	eng	Tom said he'd be at this afternoon's meeting.
6238810	eng	I wonder why Tom never learned to do that.
6238811	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be able to do anytime soon.
6238812	eng	You know that I need to do that, don't you?
6238813	eng	I won't likely tell Tom I want to do that.
6238814	eng	Tom said he wished you would do that for him.
6238815	eng	You know that I have to do that, don't you?
6238816	eng	I won't likely tell Tom I need to do that.
6238817	eng	Tom said he watched them tear down the house.
6238818	eng	You know exactly how to do that, don't you?
6238819	eng	I won't likely tell Tom I have to do that.
6238820	eng	Tom said he wasn't willing to take that risk.
6238821	eng	You know better than to do that, don't you?
6238822	eng	I wish Tom hadn't convinced me to do that.
6238823	eng	Tom said he wasn't willing to do that for us.
6238824	eng	You knew I'd refuse to do that, didn't you?
6238825	eng	I wish Tom had told me about that earlier.
6238826	eng	Tom said he wasn't sure he wanted to do that.
6238827	eng	You haven't ruled out doing that, have you?
6238828	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom that we did that.
6238829	eng	Tom said he was living in Boston at the time.
6238830	eng	You haven't done that very often, have you?
6238831	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom that I'd do that.
6238832	eng	Tom said he was having a good time in Boston.
6238833	eng	You haven't done that in a while, have you?
6238834	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom about what I did.
6238835	eng	Tom said he was asked not to do that anymore.
6238836	eng	You have to have money in order to do that.
6238837	eng	I wish I hadn't promised Tom I'd help him.
6238838	eng	Tom said he wanted to stay home this weekend.
6238839	eng	You have to do that more quickly next time.
6238840	eng	I wish I hadn't mentioned that I knew Tom.
6238841	eng	Tom said he thought he might need to do that.
6238842	eng	You have to do that before you can go home.
6238843	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom quit doing that.
6238844	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that.
6238845	eng	You have to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6238846	eng	I wish I could play tennis as well as Tom.
6238847	eng	Tom said he thought he could help us do that.
6238848	eng	You hate it when people do that, don't you?
6238849	eng	I wasn't the one who asked Tom to do that.
6238850	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be safe.
6238851	eng	You had a good time doing that, didn't you?
6238852	eng	I wasn't sure if Tom could do that or not.
6238853	eng	Tom said he needs to find another babysitter.
6238854	eng	You don't want us to do that today, do you?
6238855	eng	I wasn't able to teach Tom how to do that.
6238856	eng	Tom said he learned how to do that on Monday.
6238857	eng	You don't think we need to do that, do you?
6238858	eng	I was surprised that Tom couldn't do that.
6238859	eng	Tom said he learned how to do that in Boston.
6238860	eng	You don't think I'd really do that, do you?
6238861	eng	I was impressed when I saw Tom doing that.
6238862	eng	Tom said he hopes to be back by October 20th.
6238863	eng	You don't seem to be in a hurry to do that.
6238864	eng	I wanted to go mountain climbing with Tom.
6238865	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be allowed to do that.
6238866	eng	You don't really understand French, do you?
6238867	eng	I wanted to go home early, but Tom didn't.
6238868	eng	Tom said he hated being treated like a child.
6238869	eng	You don't really think I'd do that, do you?
6238870	eng	I want to see the house where Tom grew up.
6238871	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to take that chance.
6238872	eng	You don't really care what I think, do you?
6238873	eng	I want to know how much ice cream Tom ate.
6238874	eng	Tom said he doesn't mind buying that for you.
6238875	eng	You don't know anything about this, do you?
6238876	eng	I want to apologize to Tom for doing that.
6238877	eng	Tom said he didn't want you to do that again.
6238878	eng	You don't have time to do that now, do you?
6238879	eng	I tried to discourage Tom from doing that.
6238880	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that right now.
6238881	eng	You don't feel like doing that now, do you?
6238882	eng	I tried to convince Tom to do that for us.
6238884	eng	You don't enjoy doing that anymore, do you?
6238885	eng	I tried to convince Tom to do that for me.
6238886	eng	Tom said he didn't want that to happen again.
6238887	eng	You don't actually want to do that, do you?
6238888	eng	I told Tom we didn't have time to do that.
6238889	eng	Tom said he didn't expect the job to be easy.
6238890	eng	You don't actually need to do that, do you?
6238891	eng	I told Tom that he didn't need to do that.
6238892	eng	Tom said he didn't do what he should've done.
6238893	eng	You don't actually have to do that, do you?
6238894	eng	I told Tom that he didn't have to do that.
6238895	eng	Tom said he didn't believe that would happen.
6238896	eng	You do that faster than anyone else I know.
6238897	eng	I told Tom that I thought he looked drunk.
6238898	eng	Tom said I didn't sound as excited as he was.
6238899	eng	You do that better than anyone else I know.
6238900	eng	I told Tom that I thought I could do that.
6238901	eng	Tom realized that he shouldn't be doing that.
6238902	eng	You do that as often as you can, don't you?
6238903	eng	I told Tom it was safe for him to do that.
6238904	eng	Tom put the clothes into the washing machine.
6238905	eng	You didn't really want to do that, did you?
6238906	eng	I told Tom he didn't have time to do that.
6238907	eng	Tom promised to donate three million dollars.
6238908	eng	You didn't really need to do that, did you?
6238909	eng	I thought you said you saw Tom doing that.
6238910	eng	Tom promised that that'll never happen again.
6238911	eng	You didn't really mean to do that, did you?
6238912	eng	I thought Tom would be tempted to do that.
6238913	eng	Tom probably won't need to do that this week.
6238914	eng	You didn't really have to do that, did you?
6238915	eng	I thought Tom would be nervous doing that.
6238916	eng	Tom probably won't have to do that this week.
6238917	eng	You didn't have to do that either, did you?
6238918	eng	I thought Tom would be frightened by that.
6238919	eng	Tom probably won't figure out how to do that.
6238920	eng	You did that for your children, didn't you?
6238921	eng	I thought Tom would be doing that outside.
6238922	eng	Tom probably doesn't want to do that anymore.
6238923	eng	You did that earlier this week, didn't you?
6238924	eng	I thought Tom would be doing that all day.
6238925	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what he has to buy.
6238926	eng	You decided to do that instead, didn't you?
6238927	eng	I thought Tom would be at today's meeting.
6238928	eng	Tom pretended that he didn't know the answer.
6238929	eng	You could stay at our house if you want to.
6238930	eng	I thought Tom wasn't being careful enough.
6238931	eng	Tom practices singing up to nine hours a day.
6238932	eng	You could spend your vacation in Australia.
6238933	eng	I thought Tom was the last one to do that.
6238934	eng	Tom practices basketball all day on weekends.
6238935	eng	You can stay in Boston as long as you like.
6238936	eng	I thought Tom was going to do that for me.
6238937	eng	Tom played several tunes for us on the piano.
6238938	eng	You can do that without my help, can't you?
6238939	eng	I thought Tom no longer needed to do that.
6238940	eng	Tom plants tomatoes in his garden every year.
6238941	eng	You can do that faster than I can, I think.
6238942	eng	I thought Tom might want to do that today.
6238943	eng	Tom often reads when he's waiting for people.
6238944	eng	You can do that better than I can, I think.
6238945	eng	I thought Tom might need to do that today.
6238946	eng	Tom often goes to Boston to visit his family.
6238947	eng	You already know how to do that, don't you?
6238948	eng	I thought Tom might have to do that today.
6238949	eng	Tom must've been tired after working all day.
6238950	eng	Wouldn't it be better if you did that here?
6238951	eng	I thought Tom might be allowed to do that.
6238952	eng	Tom might visit Boston on his way to Chicago.
6238953	eng	Would you like to study in another country?
6238954	eng	I thought Tom knew what needed to be done.
6238955	eng	Tom might not be willing to buy that for you.
6238956	eng	Would it be better to do that now or later?
6238957	eng	I thought I'd be able to help Tom do that.
6238958	eng	Tom might get arrested if he does that again.
6238959	eng	Who's the most intelligent person you know?
6238960	eng	I think you could convince Tom to do that.
6238961	eng	Tom made up his mind to try doing that again.
6238962	eng	Who told you I wouldn't be able to do that?
6238963	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be impressed by that.
6238964	eng	Tom loved doing that more than anything else.
6238965	eng	Who makes the big decisions in your family?
6238966	eng	I think Tom would be reluctant to do that.
6238967	eng	Tom looked like he was in a hurry to do that.
6238968	eng	Who do you intend to travel to Boston with?
6238969	eng	I think Tom would be motivated to do that.
6238970	eng	Tom likely doesn't have the money to do that.
6238971	eng	What were you doing yesterday at this time?
6238972	eng	I think Tom won't be reluctant to do that.
6238973	eng	Tom let me know that he was going to do that.
6238974	eng	What were you doing last week at this time?
6238975	eng	I think Tom won't be motivated to do that.
6238976	eng	Tom knows he is supposed to do that tomorrow.
6238977	eng	What did you do with the rest of the books?
6238978	eng	I think Tom will come to Boston on Monday.
6238979	eng	Tom knew he might need to do that by himself.
6238980	eng	We've been waiting for you for a long time.
6238981	eng	I think Tom will be doing that by himself.
6238982	eng	Tom knew he might have to do that by himself.
6238984	eng	I think Tom will be busy tomorrow morning.
6238985	eng	Tom just called me to tell me that he's lost.
6238986	eng	We'll probably be able to do that tomorrow.
6238987	eng	I think Tom will be able to do that today.
6238988	eng	Tom isn't the kind of person who would panic.
6238989	eng	We'd be lucky if we could actually do that.
6238990	eng	I think Tom taught French a few years ago.
6238991	eng	Tom isn't quite sure what he should be doing.
6238992	eng	We won't be teaching French here next year.
6238993	eng	I think Tom might be reluctant to do that.
6238994	eng	Tom isn't going to be very impressed by that.
6238995	eng	We should've stayed in Boston until Monday.
6238996	eng	I think Tom is going to Boston next month.
6238997	eng	Tom isn't coming back to Boston anytime soon.
6238998	eng	We need to make a decision about that soon.
6238999	eng	I think Tom has to be told not to do that.
6239000	eng	Tom is trying to do what he's supposed to do.
6239001	eng	We need to find a solution to that problem.
6239002	eng	I think Tom does that at least once a day.
6239003	eng	Tom is trying hard to do what has to be done.
6239004	eng	We have to find a solution to that problem.
6239005	eng	I think Tom could've done that on his own.
6239006	eng	Tom is training one of his horses for a race.
6239007	eng	We don't speak French outside of our house.
6239008	eng	I think Tom could've done that by himself.
6239009	eng	Tom is too young to go to the zoo by himself.
6239010	eng	We don't have enough time to do that today.
6239011	eng	I think Tom could do that if he wanted to.
6239012	eng	Tom is too serious to do something like that.
6239013	eng	We didn't have time to do things like this.
6239014	eng	I think Tom could be doing that right now.
6239015	eng	Tom is the only one who felt like doing that.
6239016	eng	This time of year always has a lot of rain.
6239017	eng	I think Tom could be a very rich man soon.
6239018	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't seem worried.
6239019	eng	This supermarket stays open until midnight.
6239020	eng	I think Tom can help us do that next week.
6239021	eng	Tom is the one who knows what should be done.
6239022	eng	This is the factory where my brother works.
6239023	eng	I think I heard Tom say that he'd do that.
6239024	eng	Tom is the one who knows what has to be done.
6239025	eng	This building has several empty apartments.
6239026	eng	I suspect Tom doesn't know how to do that.
6239027	eng	Tom is the one responsible for what happened.
6239028	eng	They say it's very cold here in the winter.
6239029	eng	I sure hope Tom goes to Boston next month.
6239030	eng	Tom is the guy over there wearing sunglasses.
6239031	eng	They probably don't know anything about it.
6239032	eng	I shouldn't have kept Tom waiting so long.
6239033	eng	Tom is the guy over there reading a magazine.
6239034	eng	The only native French speaker here is you.
6239035	eng	I should've let Tom go to Boston with you.
6239036	eng	Tom is the best French teacher I've ever had.
6239037	eng	The man carrying a briefcase seemed afraid.
6239038	eng	I should've asked Tom if he could do that.
6239039	eng	Tom is taller than any other boy in the room.
6239040	eng	The little boy who gave me this seemed shy.
6239041	eng	I should tell Tom I won't do that anymore.
6239042	eng	Tom is supposed to be doing his homework now.
6239043	eng	The last three days have been really muggy.
6239044	eng	I should probably tell Tom how to do that.
6239045	eng	Tom is stronger than most people think he is.
6239046	eng	The guy who cooked our dinner was very fat.
6239047	eng	I should probably show Tom how to do that.
6239048	eng	Tom is still the weakest singer in our choir.
6239049	eng	The guy playing the saxophone seemed drunk.
6239050	eng	I should probably not tell Tom to do that.
6239051	eng	Tom is probably too depressed to do that now.
6239052	eng	Please give me some money so I can do that.
6239053	eng	I saw Tom doing that just a few hours ago.
6239054	eng	Tom is one of the best-looking people I know.
6239055	eng	Please ask to see if it's OK if we do that.
6239056	eng	I really don't think Tom wants to do that.
6239057	eng	Tom is likely to still be willing to do that.
6239058	eng	My house was struck by lightning last week.
6239059	eng	I really don't think Tom needs to do that.
6239060	eng	Tom is likely to still be tempted to do that.
6239061	eng	My father would never permit me to do that.
6239062	eng	I only gave Tom thirty minutes to do that.
6239063	eng	Tom is likely to still be fascinated by that.
6239064	eng	My family moved to Boston when I was three.
6239065	eng	I never thought Tom would want to do that.
6239066	eng	Tom is likely to be the first one to do that.
6239067	eng	My computer cost a lot more than yours did.
6239068	eng	I never thought Tom would help us do that.
6239069	eng	Tom is likely to be interested in doing that.
6239070	eng	Most people here don't know how to do that.
6239071	eng	I never thought I'd see Tom do that again.
6239073	eng	Look what I found today at the supermarket.
6239074	eng	I never expected Tom to refuse to do that.
6239075	eng	Tom is likely to be hungry when he gets here.
6239076	eng	Let's not get up so early tomorrow morning.
6239077	eng	I need to remember to tell Tom to do that.
6239078	eng	Tom is likely to be homeless by next October.
6239079	eng	Let's get something to eat on the way home.
6239080	eng	I live in Boston and Tom lives in Chicago.
6239081	eng	Tom is fortunate to still be able to do that.
6239082	eng	Just make sure you don't forget to do that.
6239083	eng	I know why Tom wasn't supposed to do that.
6239084	eng	Tom is doing his best to get that done today.
6239085	eng	It's difficult to find a job at the moment.
6239086	eng	I know that you and Tom did that together.
6239087	eng	Tom is determined to finish doing that today.
6239088	eng	It'll probably be tough for you to do that.
6239089	eng	I know that Tom doesn't like me very much.
6239090	eng	Tom is apparently in the same boat as we are.
6239091	eng	It'll probably be risky for you to do that.
6239092	eng	I know Tom will have to do that next week.
6239093	eng	Tom is already looking forward to doing that.
6239094	eng	It'll probably be cheap for you to do that.
6239095	eng	I know Tom probably won't want to do that.
6239096	eng	Tom is actually a pretty good French speaker.
6239097	eng	It wouldn't be a very good idea to do that.
6239098	eng	I know Tom probably won't need to do that.
6239099	eng	Tom injured himself when he tried to do that.
6239100	eng	It would've been safer to do that together.
6239101	eng	I knew that Tom didn't do that on purpose.
6239102	eng	Tom hopes that everyone will enjoy his party.
6239103	eng	It would likely to be good if you did that.
6239104	eng	I knew Tom would likely refuse to do that.
6239105	eng	Tom hasn't performed live since his accident.
6239106	eng	It would be remarkable if we could do that.
6239107	eng	I hope that Tom comes to my party tonight.
6239108	eng	Tom hasn't done that as many times as I have.
6239109	eng	It would be foolish to do that by yourself.
6239110	eng	I hope Tom won't tell me I should do that.
6239111	eng	Tom has tried many different ways to do that.
6239112	eng	It would be fantastic if you could do that.
6239113	eng	I hope Tom knows when he needs to do that.
6239114	eng	Tom has told me that story many times before.
6239115	eng	It would be better not to do that too much.
6239116	eng	I hope Tom isn't the first one to do that.
6239117	eng	Tom has told me he'll study French next year.
6239118	eng	Is there any chance that you won't do that?
6239119	eng	I hope Tom isn't interested in doing that.
6239120	eng	Tom has probably already forgotten your name.
6239121	eng	If you wanted me to do that again, I would.
6239122	eng	I hope Tom is still awake when I get home.
6239123	eng	Tom has one daughter and three grandchildren.
6239124	eng	I've loved you since the first time we met.
6239125	eng	I hope Tom is present at our next meeting.
6239126	eng	Tom has known how to do that for a long time.
6239127	eng	I've learned a lot in the last three years.
6239128	eng	I hope Tom is finished doing that by 2:30.
6239129	eng	Tom has just started learning how to do that.
6239130	eng	I've invited a few friends over for dinner.
6239131	eng	I hope Tom doesn't get embarrassed easily.
6239132	eng	Tom has done that more than most people have.
6239133	eng	I've done that more than I'd like to admit.
6239134	eng	I have to remember to tell Tom to do that.
6239135	eng	Tom has decided to give up trying to do that.
6239136	eng	I'm too old to be doing this kind of thing.
6239137	eng	I have a feeling that Tom never does that.
6239139	eng	I'm the only one who knows how to fix this.
6239140	eng	I happened to be on the same plane as Tom.
6239141	eng	Tom has been doing that for a very long time.
6239142	eng	I'm the only one who isn't able to do that.
6239143	eng	I got tired of waiting for Tom to do that.
6239144	eng	Tom has been asking me questions all morning.
6239145	eng	I'm surprised that I don't have to do that.
6239146	eng	I forgot to tell Tom why I didn't do that.
6239147	eng	Tom has advised me to start doing that again.
6239148	eng	I'm sure that this is some kind of mistake.
6239149	eng	I figured Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6239150	eng	Tom has a master's degree in music education.
6239151	eng	I'm supposed to speak French in the office.
6239152	eng	I expect that Tom is doing that right now.
6239153	eng	Tom had trouble sleeping because of the pain.
6239154	eng	I'm not sure that I really need to do that.
6239155	eng	I doubt that Tom could do that by himself.
6239156	eng	Tom had to do something he didn't want to do.
6239157	eng	I'm not absolutely sure that's what I need.
6239158	eng	I doubt if Tom will be through doing that.
6239159	eng	Tom had no idea what he should've been doing.
6239160	eng	I'm looking for a doctor who speaks French.
6239161	eng	I doubt if Tom will be tempted to do that.
6239162	eng	Tom got very sick and had to be hospitalized.
6239163	eng	I'm going to have to do that all by myself.
6239164	eng	I doubt if Tom will be at the beach today.
6239165	eng	Tom got out of his truck and closed the door.
6239166	eng	I'll do that tomorrow even if it's raining.
6239167	eng	I doubt if Tom has the ability to do that.
6239168	eng	Tom got a chance to try doing that last week.
6239169	eng	I'd rather do that now before it gets dark.
6239170	eng	I don't want to tell Tom how much I weigh.
6239171	eng	Tom goes to Boston two or three times a year.
6239172	eng	I wouldn't want to do that if it's illegal.
6239173	eng	I don't want to hang out with Tom anymore.
6239174	eng	Tom gave me exactly what I told him I needed.
6239175	eng	I would've done that if I'd had the chance.
6239176	eng	I don't want to go to the circus with Tom.
6239177	eng	Tom doesn't want to be in Boston next Monday.
6239178	eng	I wonder if it's dangerous to do that here.
6239179	eng	I don't want to go and Tom doesn't either.
6239180	eng	Tom doesn't think we're ready to do that yet.
6239181	eng	I won't go to Boston unless you go with me.
6239182	eng	I don't want any of the stuff Tom gave me.
6239183	eng	Tom doesn't think he's capable of doing that.
6239184	eng	I wish we had the chance to try doing that.
6239185	eng	I don't understand why Tom should do that.
6239186	eng	Tom doesn't think he really needs to do that.
6239187	eng	I wish I hadn't tried to do that by myself.
6239188	eng	I don't understand why Tom has to do that.
6239189	eng	Tom doesn't think I'll be allowed to do that.
6239190	eng	I wish I hadn't forgotten to lock the door.
6239191	eng	I don't think Tom would forget to do that.
6239192	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what he needs to do.
6239193	eng	I wasn't surprised that I couldn't do that.
6239194	eng	I don't think Tom will do that by himself.
6239195	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know about what happened.
6239196	eng	I wasn't as hungry as I thought I would be.
6239197	eng	I don't think Tom will be at school today.
6239198	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry to do that.
6239199	eng	I was told we weren't allowed to swim here.
6239200	eng	I don't think Tom will be at home tonight.
6239201	eng	Tom doesn't really want to do that right now.
6239202	eng	I was forced to do that when I was younger.
6239203	eng	I don't think Tom really wants to do that.
6239204	eng	Tom doesn't really think I did that, does he?
6239205	eng	I was annoyed by the smell of rotting fish.
6239206	eng	I don't think Tom really plans to do that.
6239207	eng	Tom doesn't really enjoy doing that, does he?
6239208	eng	I was about to do that when the phone rang.
6239209	eng	I don't think Tom really needs to do that.
6239210	eng	Tom doesn't often have the chance to do that.
6239211	eng	I was able to do that without any problems.
6239212	eng	I don't think Tom really meant to do that.
6239213	eng	Tom doesn't often complain about the weather.
6239214	eng	I wanted to do that even more than you did.
6239215	eng	I don't think Tom ought to have done that.
6239216	eng	Tom doesn't make me laugh the way he used to.
6239217	eng	I want to stay in Boston until next Monday.
6239218	eng	I don't think Tom ought to do that inside.
6239219	eng	Tom doesn't like what you're doing right now.
6239220	eng	I want to see a doctor as soon as possible.
6239221	eng	I don't think Tom is reluctant to do that.
6239222	eng	Tom doesn't like spending time in the garden.
6239223	eng	I want to know why you're going to do that.
6239224	eng	I don't think Tom is permitted to do that.
6239225	eng	Tom doesn't know he's not likely to be fired.
6239226	eng	I want to know why you didn't call me back.
6239227	eng	I don't think Tom is motivated to do that.
6239228	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly what he ought to do.
6239229	eng	I want to know where you've hidden the key.
6239230	eng	I don't think Tom is desperate to do that.
6239231	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly what he needs to do.
6239232	eng	I want to know when we're going to do that.
6239233	eng	I don't think Tom is back from Boston yet.
6239234	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly what has to be done.
6239235	eng	I want to know how you're going to do that.
6239236	eng	I don't think Tom can afford to buy a car.
6239237	eng	Tom doesn't know a lot about classical music.
6239238	eng	I want to buy a house in this neighborhood.
6239239	eng	I don't think I should ask Tom to do that.
6239240	eng	Tom doesn't have very many friends in Boston.
6239241	eng	I want to buy a car, but I can't afford to.
6239242	eng	I don't suppose Tom will do that tomorrow.
6239243	eng	Tom doesn't have much experience in teaching.
6239244	eng	I try to never make the same mistake twice.
6239245	eng	I don't see why Tom would want to do that.
6239246	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends here except you.
6239247	eng	I thought you were still working in Boston.
6239248	eng	I don't remember the first time I met Tom.
6239249	eng	Tom doesn't have a choice. He has to do that.
6239250	eng	I thought you said you'd do that on Monday.
6239251	eng	I don't remember Tom asking me to do that.
6239252	eng	Tom doesn't doubt his own ability to do that.
6239253	eng	I thought you said you heard some gunshots.
6239254	eng	I don't really think Tom wants to do that.
6239255	eng	Tom died shortly after the ambulance arrived.
6239256	eng	I thought you said you heard a dog barking.
6239257	eng	I don't really think Tom needs to do that.
6239258	eng	Tom died less than a week after the accident.
6239259	eng	I thought a lot about how I should do that.
6239260	eng	I don't really enjoy hanging out with Tom.
6239261	eng	Tom didn't want to admit he couldn't do that.
6239262	eng	I thought I'd forgotten to lock the door.
6239263	eng	I don't need any of the stuff Tom gave me.
6239264	eng	Tom didn't think we would be able to do that.
6239265	eng	I thought I'd be able to do that yesterday.
6239266	eng	I don't like the way Tom cooks vegetables.
6239267	eng	Tom didn't tell me that he grew up in Boston.
6239268	eng	I thought I'd be able to do that by myself.
6239269	eng	I don't know why Tom went to the hospital.
6239270	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what he needed to do.
6239271	eng	I thought I could do that without any help.
6239272	eng	I don't know why Tom wanted me to do that.
6239273	eng	Tom didn't seem to enjoy reading comic books.
6239274	eng	I though I'd never get a chance to do that.
6239275	eng	I don't know why Tom is afraid to do that.
6239276	eng	Tom didn't seem like he was enjoying himself.
6239277	eng	I think you could've done that on your own.
6239278	eng	I don't know who Tom went to the zoo with.
6239279	eng	Tom didn't often do that when he was younger.
6239280	eng	I think something strange is going on here.
6239281	eng	I don't know whether Tom is sleepy or not.
6239282	eng	Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
6239283	eng	I think it's probably unethical to do that.
6239284	eng	I don't know whether Tom is dead or alive.
6239285	eng	Tom didn't know what he should've been doing.
6239286	eng	I think it's probably not cheap to do that.
6239287	eng	I don't know whether Tom can drive or not.
6239288	eng	Tom didn't know that he had to do that today.
6239289	eng	I think it's probably expensive to do that.
6239290	eng	I don't know where Tom keeps his passport.
6239291	eng	Tom didn't know it was impossible to do that.
6239292	eng	I think it's probably dangerous to do that.
6239293	eng	I don't know where Tom buys his groceries.
6239294	eng	Tom didn't know how much money he would need.
6239295	eng	I think it wouldn't be much fun to do that.
6239296	eng	I don't know where Tom bought his bicycle.
6239297	eng	Tom didn't know how much I wanted to do that.
6239298	eng	I think it would be a good idea to do that.
6239299	eng	I don't know when Tom is supposed to come.
6239300	eng	Tom didn't know anything about what happened.
6239301	eng	I think it might be interesting to do that.
6239302	eng	I don't know what kind of music Tom likes.
6239303	eng	Tom didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that.
6239304	eng	I think I'm the only one who can't do that.
6239305	eng	I don't know what Tom would like me to do.
6239306	eng	Tom didn't do that because he didn't want to.
6239307	eng	I still haven't learned how to drive a car.
6239308	eng	I don't know how much money Tom has spent.
6239309	eng	Tom didn't do everything we wanted him to do.
6239310	eng	I don't care about what Tom says about me.
6239311	eng	Tom did that for the first time this morning.
6239312	eng	I still have a lot of things I want to buy.
6239313	eng	I don't believe Tom really has to do that.
6239314	eng	Tom devoted a lot of time to studying French.
6239315	eng	I still have a lot of things I need to buy.
6239316	eng	I do basically the same thing as Tom does.
6239317	eng	Tom decided I was the one who should do that.
6239318	eng	I still have a lot of things I have to buy.
6239319	eng	I didn't warn Tom about what might happen.
6239320	eng	Tom cut his finger when he was opening a can.
6239321	eng	I still have a couple of books you lent me.
6239322	eng	I didn't want to go to the dance with Tom.
6239323	eng	Tom could get injured if he tried to do that.
6239324	eng	I should've waited until Monday to do that.
6239325	eng	I didn't want to go and Tom didn't either.
6239326	eng	Tom could get arrested if he does that again.
6239327	eng	I should've stayed in Boston, but I didn't.
6239328	eng	I didn't want Tom to know what I had done.
6239329	eng	Tom could be supportive when he wanted to be.
6239330	eng	I should've stayed and helped you clean up.
6239331	eng	I didn't want Tom to go to Boston with me.
6239332	eng	Tom clapped his hands and the light went out.
6239333	eng	I should've known that you'd be here today.
6239334	eng	I didn't trust Tom and he didn't trust me.
6239335	eng	Tom chose to go to Boston instead of Chicago.
6239336	eng	I should've discussed that with my parents.
6239337	eng	I didn't think Tom would still be at home.
6239338	eng	Tom came to visit us with his new girlfriend.
6239339	eng	I should've been able to do that on my own.
6239340	eng	I didn't think Tom would leave without me.
6239341	eng	Tom came home from school earlier than usual.
6239342	eng	I should probably not have done that again.
6239343	eng	I didn't think Tom would enjoy that movie.
6239344	eng	Tom called his wife to tell her he'd be late.
6239345	eng	I should be ready by the time you get here.
6239346	eng	I didn't think Tom would come to my party.
6239347	eng	Tom began writing songs when he was thirteen.
6239348	eng	I should be able to do that in three hours.
6239349	eng	I didn't think Tom would be in his office.
6239350	eng	Tom asked me why I did that the way I did it.
6239351	eng	I see no need to stay in Boston any longer.
6239352	eng	I didn't think Tom was violating any laws.
6239353	eng	Tom asked me if I'd like to do that with him.
6239354	eng	I probably won't come to Boston this month.
6239355	eng	I didn't think Tom was through doing that.
6239356	eng	Tom asked if it would be safe if he did that.
6239357	eng	I probably should've been more cooperative.
6239358	eng	I didn't think Tom was nervous doing that.
6239359	eng	Tom and his wife have adopted three children.
6239360	eng	I plan on staying in Boston for three days.
6239361	eng	I didn't think Tom was doing that anymore.
6239362	eng	Tom and I've known each other for many years.
6239363	eng	I need to go to the bank to get some money.
6239364	eng	I didn't think Tom had to do that anymore.
6239365	eng	Tom and I've decided not to do that together.
6239366	eng	I need three volunteers to help me do that.
6239367	eng	I didn't tell Tom why he had to work late.
6239368	eng	Tom and I'll be in the lobby waiting for you.
6239369	eng	I looked around, but I didn't see anything.
6239370	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I wanted to do that.
6239371	eng	Tom and I'll apparently be on the same train.
6239372	eng	I know we'll be able to do that eventually.
6239373	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I needed to do that.
6239374	eng	Tom and I were working together at that time.
6239375	eng	I know someone who might lend you a guitar.
6239376	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I needed more money.
6239377	eng	Tom and I were seated across from each other.
6239378	eng	I know a good store with reasonable prices.
6239379	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I didn't want to go.
6239380	eng	Tom and I were completely alone on the beach.
6239381	eng	I know I'm probably going to lose the race.
6239382	eng	I didn't tell Tom that you were an ex-con.
6239383	eng	Tom and I were always together in those days.
6239384	eng	I know I won't be allowed to do that again.
6239385	eng	I didn't tell Tom that you were a drummer.
6239386	eng	Tom and I went fishing together last weekend.
6239387	eng	I know I don't have enough time to do that.
6239388	eng	I didn't tell Tom I wanted to quit my job.
6239389	eng	Tom and I wanted to go to the dance together.
6239390	eng	I just found out that you can speak French.
6239391	eng	I didn't tell Tom I couldn't speak French.
6239392	eng	Tom and I want to buy a house on Park Street.
6239393	eng	I hope we'll be able to do that eventually.
6239394	eng	I didn't realize that Tom was lying to me.
6239395	eng	Tom and I usually eat lunch in the cafeteria.
6239396	eng	I hope I have the chance to try doing that.
6239397	eng	I didn't like the way Tom treated his dog.
6239398	eng	Tom and I traveled together for three months.
6239399	eng	I haven't yet done what you asked me to do.
6239400	eng	I didn't like the spaghetti that Tom made.
6239401	eng	Tom and I traveled around Australia together.
6239402	eng	I haven't yet done everything I need to do.
6239403	eng	I didn't like the answer that Tom gave me.
6239404	eng	Tom and I talked for at least thirty minutes.
6239405	eng	I haven't yet done everything I have to do.
6239406	eng	I didn't know which train Tom would be on.
6239407	eng	Tom and I take the same bus home from school.
6239408	eng	I haven't been on a picnic for a long time.
6239409	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was safe or not.
6239410	eng	Tom and I haven't known each other very long.
6239411	eng	I gave up trying to do that many years ago.
6239412	eng	I didn't know whether Tom was busy or not.
6239413	eng	Tom and I graduated from the same university.
6239414	eng	I don't yet know exactly what I need to do.
6239415	eng	I didn't know where to put Tom's suitcase.
6239416	eng	Tom and I go to church together every Sunday.
6239417	eng	I don't yet know exactly what I have to do.
6239418	eng	I didn't know when Tom had come to Boston.
6239419	eng	Tom and I flew to Boston last month together.
6239420	eng	I don't want to talk about what's happened.
6239421	eng	I didn't know what to do when Tom fainted.
6239422	eng	Tom and I fight with each other all the time.
6239423	eng	I don't want to talk about my private life.
6239424	eng	I didn't know what Tom was supposed to do.
6239425	eng	Tom and I each took a swig out of the bottle.
6239426	eng	I don't want to spend that much for a meal.
6239427	eng	I didn't know what Tom was planning to do.
6239428	eng	Tom and I don't live too far from each other.
6239429	eng	I don't want to do anything that's illegal.
6239430	eng	I didn't know the reason why Tom was late.
6239431	eng	Tom and I don't like the same kind of movies.
6239432	eng	I don't want to be the last one to do that.
6239433	eng	I didn't know that you were Tom's brother.
6239434	eng	Tom and I don't know what we need to do next.
6239435	eng	I don't want the same thing to happen here.
6239436	eng	I didn't know that Tom was looking for me.
6239437	eng	Tom and I don't know what we have to do next.
6239438	eng	I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.
6239439	eng	I didn't know that Tom had three children.
6239440	eng	Tom and I didn't have anything to talk about.
6239441	eng	I don't think you'll be allowed to do that.
6239442	eng	I didn't know if Tom would do that or not.
6239443	eng	Tom and I arrived in Boston at the same time.
6239444	eng	I don't think they'll permit me to do that.
6239445	eng	I didn't know if Tom could do that or not.
6239446	eng	Tom and I are thinking about getting married.
6239447	eng	I don't think it's wise for you to do that.
6239448	eng	I didn't know Tom wasn't going to do that.
6239449	eng	Tom and I are taking a break from each other.
6239450	eng	I don't think it would be wrong to do that.
6239451	eng	I didn't know Tom was supposed to do that.
6239452	eng	Tom and I are married, but not to each other.
6239453	eng	I don't think it would be risky to do that.
6239454	eng	I didn't know Tom had been married before.
6239455	eng	Tom and I almost got married three years ago.
6239456	eng	I don't think it would be cheap to do that.
6239457	eng	I didn't have Tom's permission to do that.
6239458	eng	Tom almost went to Boston instead of Chicago.
6239459	eng	I don't think I'm going to do that anymore.
6239460	eng	I didn't expect Tom to be at school today.
6239461	eng	Tom almost injured himself trying to do that.
6239462	eng	I don't think I'll ever be able to do that.
6239463	eng	I didn't drink the wine Tom poured for me.
6239464	eng	Tom said there was no need for you to do that.
6239465	eng	I don't think I'll be permitted to do that.
6239466	eng	I didn't care whether Tom liked me or not.
6239467	eng	Tom's three sons are still living in Boston.
6239468	eng	I don't spend enough time with my children.
6239469	eng	I didn't call Tom like I promised I would.

6239471	eng	I don't really like Italian food very much.
6239472	eng	I can't speak French and Tom can't either.

6239474	eng	I don't really feel like playing badminton.
6239475	eng	I can't remember when Tom moved to Boston.
6239476	eng	Tom would never forgive you if you did that.
6239477	eng	I don't often do my homework before dinner.
6239478	eng	I bought this car from Tom just last week.
6239479	eng	Tom would never do that when he was younger.
6239480	eng	I don't need to worry about that happening.
6239481	eng	I already know what Tom is planning to do.
6239482	eng	Tom won't permit you to continue doing that.
6239483	eng	I don't need to do that if I don't want to.
6239484	eng	How many years did it take Tom to do that?
6239485	eng	Tom won't likely be the next one to do that.
6239486	eng	I don't know why I was supposed to do that.
6239488	eng	Tom won't likely be the last one to do that.
6239489	eng	I don't know who can do that and who can't.
6239490	eng	How many weeks did it take Tom to do that?
6239491	eng	Tom won't likely be forgiven for doing that.
6239492	eng	I don't know what this is called in French.

6239495	eng	I don't know how much the ticket will cost.
6239496	eng	How many times did Tom call you yesterday?
6239497	eng	Tom won't likely be excused from doing that.
6239498	eng	I don't know exactly what needs to be done.
6239499	eng	How many loaves of bread did you give Tom?
6239500	eng	Tom won't likely be enthusiastic about that.

6239509	eng	Tom won't be able to keep up with his class.
6239510	eng	I don't have time to talk to you right now.
6239511	eng	How long has Tom already spent doing that?

6239513	eng	I don't have the skill required to do that.
6239514	eng	How long did it take Tom to get to Boston?
6239515	eng	Tom won't be able to answer their questions.
6239516	eng	I don't have the courage to go there alone.
6239517	eng	How did you know Tom was going to be here?
6239518	eng	Tom will probably get fined if he does that.
6239519	eng	I don't have anything else to do right now.
6239520	eng	Has Tom decided to do that again tomorrow?
6239521	eng	Tom will probably figure out how to do that.
6239522	eng	I don't have any money, so I won't do that.
6239523	eng	Even though it's Monday, Tom will do that.
6239524	eng	Tom will likely have a hard time doing that.
6239525	eng	I don't believe you really want to do that.
6239526	eng	Do you think Tom is determined to do that?
6239527	eng	Tom will likely be very hesitant to do that.
6239528	eng	I don't believe you really need to do that.
6239529	eng	Do you think Tom can do that without help?
6239530	eng	Tom will likely be the first one to do that.
6239531	eng	I don't believe you really have to do that.
6239532	eng	Do you suppose that man over there is Tom?
6239533	eng	Tom will likely be sarcastic. He usually is.
6239534	eng	I don't allow my children to eat junk food.
6239535	eng	Do you know whether Tom is doing that now?
6239536	eng	Tom will likely be interested in doing that.
6239537	eng	I didn't want to think about the situation.
6239538	eng	Do you know the reason why Tom was crying?
6239539	eng	Tom will likely be hungry when he gets home.
6239540	eng	I didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
6239541	eng	Do you have any idea what Tom wants to do?

6239543	eng	I didn't want to do that without some help.
6239544	eng	Do you have any idea what Tom needs to do?
6239545	eng	Tom will likely be concerned about the cost.
6239546	eng	I didn't want my neighbors to see me naked.
6239547	eng	Do you ever see Tom when you're in Boston?
6239548	eng	Tom will go to Boston on business next week.

6239552	eng	I didn't think you'd be nervous doing that.
6239553	eng	Didn't you know that Tom is in Boston now?
6239554	eng	Tom will definitely get a chance to do that.
6239555	eng	I didn't think you'd be at today's meeting.
6239556	eng	Didn't you know that Tom is afraid of you?
6239557	eng	Tom will be the only one allowed to do that.
6239558	eng	I didn't think you were through doing that.
6239559	eng	Didn't you know Tom wasn't having any fun?

6239564	epo	Ĉiuj amoj estas eternaj. Tio, kio ŝanĝas, estas la persono.

6239566	eng	Didn't you know Tom was going to be fired?
6239567	eng	Tom wears a kilt when he plays the bagpipes.
6239568	eng	I didn't think I'd ever be able to do that.
6239569	eng	Didn't you know Tom was coming here today?
6239570	eng	Tom wasn't very difficult to get along with.
6239571	eng	I didn't think I would be bored, but I was.

6239574	eng	I didn't tell anyone where I hid the money.

6239577	eng	I didn't stay as long as I thought I would.
6239578	eng	Did you tell Tom what time he should come?
6239579	eng	Tom wasn't the one who gave me this trumpet.
6239580	eng	I didn't really think I'd enjoy doing that.
6239581	eng	Did you know what to do when Tom did that?
6239582	eng	Tom wasn't the one who ate all of the ice cream.
6239583	eng	I didn't really feel like doing that today.
6239584	eng	Did you know Tom was going to be arrested?
6239585	eng	Tom wasn't expecting you to do that for him.
6239586	eng	I didn't make any mistakes on today's test.
6239587	eng	Did you know Tom used to enjoy doing that?

6239601	eng	I didn't know you used to enjoy doing that.
6239602	eng	All three of Tom's brothers are in prison.
6239603	eng	Tom was surprised when his plan didn't work.
6239604	eng	I didn't know whether I was right or wrong.
6239605	eng	"Who's that letter from?" "It's from Tom."
6239606	eng	Tom was one of the best players on our team.
6239607	eng	I didn't know whether I could do it or not.
6239608	eng	You're one of Tom's students, aren't you?
6239609	eng	Tom was convinced that he needed to do that.
6239610	eng	I didn't know what to do in that situation.
6239611	eng	You'll ask Tom not to do that, won't you?
6239612	eng	Tom was already asleep when I got here.
6239613	eng	I didn't know that what I'd done was wrong.
6239614	eng	You'd better write Tom a letter, I think.
6239615	eng	Tom wants to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6239616	eng	I didn't know how to cope with the problem.
6239617	eng	You weren't supposed to help Tom do that.
6239618	eng	Tom usually stays at a hotel on Park Street.
6239619	eng	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to do that.
6239620	eng	You told Tom that I did that, didn't you?
6239621	eng	Tom told us that we need to be more careful.
6239622	eng	I didn't kiss my wife goodbye this morning.
6239623	eng	You told Tom I could do that, didn't you?
6239624	eng	Tom told us that there was no need to hurry.
6239625	eng	I didn't have enough money to pay the rent.
6239626	eng	You shouldn't have done that without Tom.
6239627	eng	Tom told me that he's determined to do that.
6239628	eng	I didn't have enough money to pay the bill.
6239629	eng	You should tell Tom not to do that today.
6239630	eng	Tom told me that he'd be willing to do that.
6239631	eng	I didn't go to sleep until 2:30 last night.
6239632	eng	You should tell Tom not to do that again.
6239633	eng	Tom told me that I'm always too pessimistic.
6239634	eng	I didn't get off the bus where I should've.
6239635	eng	You need to make sure that Tom does that.
6239636	eng	Tom told me that I should go back to Boston.
6239637	eng	I didn't get home until way after midnight.
6239638	eng	You look even more nervous than Tom does.
6239639	eng	Tom told me he's still not fluent in French.
6239640	eng	I didn't get along with the other students.
6239641	eng	You like the way Tom did that, don't you?
6239642	eng	Tom told me he's not going to do that again.
6239643	eng	I didn't expect to get paid for doing that.
6239644	eng	You hope that Tom can do that, don't you?
6239645	eng	Tom told me he'd wait until 2:30 to do that.
6239646	eng	I didn't do everything you wanted me to do.
6239647	eng	You have to make sure that Tom does that.
6239648	eng	Tom told me he won't be in Boston next week.
6239649	eng	I didn't arrive until the meeting was over.
6239650	eng	You have to do that before Tom gets here.
6239651	eng	Tom told me he already has plans for Monday.
6239652	eng	I didn't arrive until the concert was over.
6239653	eng	You don't think Tom will do that, do you?
6239654	eng	Tom thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
6239655	eng	I didn't anticipate that this would happen.
6239656	eng	You don't need to know how Tom does that.
6239657	eng	Tom thinks that we won't be able to do that.
6239658	eng	I didn't anticipate that that would happen.
6239659	eng	You do that so much better than Tom does.
6239660	eng	Tom thinks that doing that isn't a bad idea.
6239661	eng	I did that the same way everybody else did.
6239662	eng	You could've excused Tom from doing that.
6239663	eng	Tom thinks some of his friends will do that.
6239664	eng	I can't tell you the reason why I did that.
6239665	eng	You can do that even better than Tom can.
6239666	eng	Tom thinks he's the best actor in the world.
6239667	eng	I can't remember who I lent my umbrella to.
6239668	eng	You and I are the only people Tom trusts.
6239669	eng	Tom sure has managed to make a lot of money.
6239670	eng	I can't remember where I put my sunglasses.
6239671	eng	Will Tom really stay in Boston all month?
6239672	eng	Tom studies much harder now than he used to.
6239673	eng	I can't do that now because I'm very tired.
6239674	eng	Will Tom really be doing that by himself?
6239675	eng	Tom still speaks French, but not very often.
6239676	eng	I can't do that as well as most people can.
6239677	eng	Will Tom come to Boston for Thanksgiving?
6239678	eng	Tom still has a lot of things he has to buy.
6239679	eng	I can't believe you really need to do that.
6239680	eng	Why don't you get Tom to do that for you?
6239681	eng	Tom still goes to Boston a few times a year.
6239682	eng	I can't believe you really have to do that.
6239683	eng	Who told you Tom could understand French?
6239684	eng	Tom starts his job at 2:30 in the afternoon.
6239685	eng	I can stay in Boston for about three weeks.
6239686	eng	When's Tom coming back from his vacation?
6239687	eng	Tom started working here in October of 2013.
6239688	eng	I already know the answer to that question.
6239689	eng	When I saw Tom, I recognized him at once.
6239690	eng	Tom started doing that when he was thirteen.
6239691	eng	I almost have enough time to do that today.
6239692	eng	What time does Tom do that every morning?
6239693	eng	Tom spent the morning reading the newspaper.
6239694	eng	I advise you to do that as soon as you can.
6239695	eng	Weren't you supposed to do that with Tom?
6239696	eng	Tom spends most of his free time doing that.
6239697	eng	How many weeks will it take you to do that?
6239698	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to do that?
6239699	eng	Tom spends his free time playing the guitar.
6239700	eng	How many months will it take us to do that?
6239701	eng	We'll probably go to Boston in Tom's car.
6239702	eng	Tom sounds like a pretty interesting person.
6239703	eng	How many months did it take you to do that?
6239704	eng	Wasn't Tom supposed to do that yesterday?
6239705	eng	Tom sometimes help me with my math homework.
6239707	eng	Wasn't Tom supposed to do that on Monday?
6239708	eng	Tom slipped when he was crossing the street.
6239709	eng	How many hours will it take you to do that?
6239710	eng	This is the third time Tom has done that.
6239711	eng	Tom shouldn't have permitted you to do that.
6239712	eng	How many hot dogs did you eat last weekend?
6239713	eng	There's no way Tom would want to do that.
6239714	eng	Tom should've visited Boston, but he didn't.
6239715	eng	How long have you already spent doing that?
6239716	eng	There's no telling when Tom will do that.
6239717	eng	Tom should've parked his car somewhere else.
6239718	eng	How far is it to the post office from here?
6239719	eng	There are times when Tom doesn't do that.
6239720	eng	Tom should've done that before he went home.
6239721	eng	Everything's back to the way it used to be.
6239722	eng	The question is whether Tom will do that.
6239723	eng	Tom should've come to the meeting yesterday.
6239724	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary to do that today.
6239725	eng	The person I usually do that with is Tom.
6239726	eng	Tom should've been the first one to do that.
6239727	eng	Doing that will be more fun than you think.
6239728	eng	The explanation Tom gave was interesting.
6239729	eng	Tom should've been more curious than he was.
6239730	eng	Do you want me to help you clean your room?
6239731	eng	The cut on Tom's leg has gotten infected.
6239732	eng	Tom should've been interested in doing that.
6239733	eng	Do you think you'd be miserable doing that?
6239734	eng	Tell Tom he needs to do that before 2:30.
6239735	eng	Tom should've been OK doing that by himself.
6239736	eng	Do you think we'll be permitted to do that?
6239737	eng	Please tell Tom to close all the windows.
6239738	eng	Tom should be very hungry when he gets home.
6239739	eng	Do you think it's safe to drink this water?
6239740	eng	Please tell Tom that he needs to do that.
6239741	eng	Tom shielded his eyes from the bright light.
6239742	eng	Do you think doing that would be dangerous?
6239743	eng	Please tell Tom he ought to do that soon.
6239744	eng	Tom seldom does his homework in the kitchen.
6239745	eng	Do you really think it's unsafe to do that?
6239746	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to wear goggles.
6239747	eng	Tom seems to be reluctant to do that for us.
6239748	eng	Do you really think it's stupid to do that?
6239749	eng	Most likely Tom won't be able to do that.
6239750	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what was going on.
6239751	eng	Do you know anyone who has gotten divorced?
6239752	eng	Maybe Tom will come to Boston in October.
6239753	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what he had to do.
6239754	eng	Do you have any idea what needs to be done?
6239755	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know much about Boston.
6239756	eng	Tom seemed convinced that he had to do that.
6239757	eng	Do you have any friends who don't eat rice?
6239758	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know anything about it.
6239759	eng	Tom seemed a little busier today than usual.
6239760	eng	Didn't you know you didn't need to do that?
6239761	eng	Maybe I should ask Tom to do that for me.
6239762	eng	Tom says that he'll teach French to my kids.
6239763	eng	Didn't you know you didn't have to do that?
6239764	eng	It's almost noon and Tom is still in bed.
6239765	eng	Tom says he's always wanted to study French.
6239766	eng	Didn't you know what you were getting into?
6239767	eng	It would be dangerous for Tom to do that.
6239768	eng	Tom says he'd rather not do that by himself.
6239769	eng	Didn't you know it was possible to do that?
6239770	eng	It took Tom about three hours to do that.
6239771	eng	Tom says he thinks it's possible to do that.
6239772	eng	Did you buy that painting we saw yesterday?
6239773	eng	It sounds like Tom might want to do that.
6239774	eng	Tom says he thinks he'll be able to do that.
6239775	eng	Can you take care of my dog while I'm away?
6239776	eng	It sounds like Tom might need to do that.
6239777	eng	Tom says he needs to find someplace to live.
6239778	eng	Am I the only one who knows how to do that?
6239779	eng	It sounds like Tom might have to do that.
6239780	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know where to go.
6239781	eng	About how many times a week do you do that?
6239782	eng	It seems like Tom enjoys being miserable.
6239783	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know what to buy.
6239784	eng	"Do I have to do that?" "Yes, you have to."
6239785	eng	It looks like Tom won't be here tomorrow.
6239786	eng	Tom says he doesn't intend to do that again.
6239787	eng	Your French pronunciation isn't very good.
6239788	eng	It looks as if Tom has already done that.
6239789	eng	Tom says he doesn't have to do that anymore.
6239790	eng	You're the only person I can really trust.
6239791	eng	Is there any chance Tom is in Boston now?
6239792	eng	Tom says he can already do that fairly well.
6239793	eng	You're the only one who's able to do that.
6239794	eng	Is Tom the only one who wants to do that?
6239795	eng	Tom sat in his armchair, reading a magazine.
6239796	eng	You're one of the stingiest people I know.
6239797	eng	Is Tom the only one who needs to do that?
6239798	eng	Tom said you're better at French than he is.
6239799	eng	You're not the only one who can't do that.
6239800	eng	I've been asked not to tell Tom anything.
6239801	eng	Tom said you wanted to go to Boston with us.
6239802	eng	You're about ready to do that, aren't you?
6239803	eng	I'm the person who gave Tom that bicycle.
6239804	eng	Tom said the smell didn't bother him at all.
6239805	eng	You're a straight‑A student, aren't you?
6239806	eng	I'm sure Tom would be willing to do that.
6239807	eng	Tom said that wasn't the reason he did that.
6239808	eng	You'll have a really hard time doing that.
6239809	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be tempted to do that.
6239810	eng	Tom said that probably won't happen anymore.
6239811	eng	You'll do that sooner or later, won't you?
6239812	eng	I'm sure Tom will be hesitant to do that.
6239813	eng	Tom said not doing that was never an option.
6239814	eng	You'll definitely get a chance to do that.
6239815	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be punished.
6239816	eng	Tom said no cars passed him on his way here.
6239817	eng	You'll be the only one allowed to do that.
6239818	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be arrested.
6239819	eng	Tom said last night's concert was enjoyable.
6239820	eng	You'll be doing that on Monday, won't you?
6239821	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom won't try to do that.
6239822	eng	Tom said it wasn't likely to happen anymore.
6239823	eng	You'd have to be pretty stupid to do that.
6239824	eng	I'm not the one who asked Tom to do that.
6239825	eng	Tom said his schedule would probably change.
6239826	eng	You won't have to do that again, will you?
6239827	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom wants to do.
6239828	eng	Tom said his parents have never spanked him.
6239829	eng	You won't be permitted to do that anymore.
6239830	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom needs to do.
6239831	eng	Tom said his house was damaged in the storm.
6239832	eng	You won't be able to do that without help.
6239833	eng	I'm not going to show Tom how to do that.
6239834	eng	Tom said his father told him not to do that.
6239835	eng	You weren't supposed to do that, were you?
6239836	eng	I'm glad that Tom learned how to do that.
6239837	eng	Tom said he's ready to do whatever it takes.
6239838	eng	You were the one who did that weren't you?
6239839	eng	I'm almost certain that Tom will do that.
6239840	eng	Tom said he's looking forward to doing that.
6239841	eng	You were planning to do that, weren't you?
6239842	eng	I'll probably do that on Monday with Tom.
6239843	eng	Tom said he's glad you were able to do that.
6239844	eng	You were in Boston last week, weren't you?
6239845	eng	I'll do that with Tom tomorrow afternoon.
6239846	eng	Tom said he's been trying to be cooperative.
6239847	eng	You were drinking last night, weren't you?
6239848	eng	I'd hoped Tom could learn how to do that.
6239849	eng	Tom said he's been told not do that anymore.
6239850	eng	You think I'll do that for you, don't you?
6239851	eng	I'd be very disappointed if Tom did that.
6239852	eng	Tom said he'll be in his office all morning.
6239853	eng	You think I could've done that, don't you?
6239854	eng	I write to Tom two or three times a week.
6239855	eng	Tom said he'd like to continue working here.
6239856	eng	You still haven't done that yet, have you?
6239857	eng	I wouldn't do that the way Tom suggested.
6239858	eng	Tom said he'd be back the Monday after next.
6239859	eng	You still do that every summer, don't you?
6239860	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't want to do that.
6239861	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be in Boston next week.
6239862	eng	You still do that every Monday, don't you?
6239863	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't need to do that.
6239864	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to help us anymore.
6239865	eng	You should've been able to do that easily.
6239866	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't like doing that.
6239867	eng	Tom said he was willing to do that tomorrow.
6239868	eng	You should be finished doing that by 2:30.
6239869	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't have to do that.
6239870	eng	Tom said he was too tired to go any further.
6239871	eng	You should be able to do that on your own.
6239872	eng	I wonder whether Tom did that last night.
6239873	eng	Tom said he was too out of shape to do that.
6239874	eng	You seemed to be very hesitant to do that.
6239875	eng	I wonder what'll happen if Tom does that.
6239876	eng	Tom said he was told not to do that anymore.
6239877	eng	You seem to be surprised by what happened.
6239878	eng	I wonder if Tom would be able to do that.
6239879	eng	Tom said he was looking for a job in Boston.
6239880	eng	You promised you wouldn't do that anymore.
6239881	eng	I wish I hadn't permitted Tom to do that.
6239882	eng	Tom said he was just about ready to do that.
6239883	eng	You need to stay here and help me do that.
6239884	eng	I wish I hadn't convinced Tom to do that.
6239885	eng	Tom said he was going to do that by himself.
6239886	eng	You must be very careful when you do that.
6239887	eng	I wish I hadn't been late to Tom's party.
6239888	eng	Tom said he wanted to buy something cheaper.
6239889	eng	You look like you've lost a lot of weight.
6239890	eng	I wasn't able to convince Tom to do that.
6239891	eng	Tom said he thought that would never happen.
6239892	eng	You look like you're really concentrating.
6239893	eng	I was going to ask Tom to do that for me.
6239894	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to help us.
6239895	eng	You look almost exactly like your brother.
6239896	eng	I want to know what Tom did last weekend.
6239897	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to do that.
6239898	eng	You know why I need to do that, don't you?
6239899	eng	I want to give Tom the chance to do that.
6239900	eng	Tom said he thought he could do that for me.
6239901	eng	You know why I have to do that, don't you?
6239902	eng	I tried not to keep Tom waiting too long.
6239903	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be fun.
6239904	eng	You knew that I could do that, didn't you?
6239905	eng	I told Tom that I wanted to go to Boston.
6239906	eng	Tom said he still had a lot of things to do.
6239907	eng	You knew I'd agree to do that, didn't you?
6239908	eng	I told Tom that I didn't need to do that.
6239909	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't do that today.
6239910	eng	You hope I never do that again, don't you?
6239911	eng	I told Tom that I didn't know what to do.
6239912	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't do that again.
6239913	eng	You haven't done that this year, have you?
6239914	eng	I told Tom that I didn't have to do that.
6239915	eng	Tom said he hoped he didn't need to do that.
6239916	eng	You don't want to do that tonight, do you?
6239917	eng	I told Tom I didn't have time to do that.
6239918	eng	Tom said he hoped he didn't have to do that.
6239919	eng	You don't want to do that anymore, do you?
6239920	eng	I thought you said you'd do that for Tom.
6239921	eng	Tom said he hasn't decided what needs to be done.
6239922	eng	You don't think we should do that, do you?
6239923	eng	I thought Tom wasn't finished doing that.
6239924	eng	Tom said he hadn't done that in three years.
6239925	eng	You don't think we did that right, do you?
6239926	eng	I thought Tom wasn't at home last Monday.
6239927	eng	Tom said he had something going on tomorrow.
6239928	eng	You don't think I need to do that, do you?
6239929	eng	I thought Tom was going to do that today.
6239930	eng	Tom said he figured he'd be able to do that.
6239931	eng	You don't seem to be in a good mood today.
6239932	eng	I thought Tom was going to be happy here.
6239933	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that anymore.
6239934	eng	You don't really think I did that, do you?
6239935	eng	I thought Tom didn't know how to do that.
6239936	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he has to do that.
6239937	eng	You don't really like Korean food, do you?
6239938	eng	I thought I'd be able to do that for Tom.
6239939	eng	Tom said he doesn't mind doing that for you.
6239940	eng	You don't really enjoy doing that, do you?
6239941	eng	I think that Tom doesn't have to do that.
6239942	eng	Tom said he didn't want to work as a waiter.
6239944	eng	I think Tom would like to live in Boston.
6239945	eng	Tom said he didn't want to make you do that.
6239946	eng	You don't like it when we do that, do you?
6239947	eng	I think Tom would like to be cooperative.
6239948	eng	Tom said he didn't want to borrow any money.
6239949	eng	You don't know how much I want to do that.
6239950	eng	I think Tom would be upset if I did that.
6239951	eng	Tom said he didn't need any more volunteers.
6239952	eng	You don't intend to do that again, do you?
6239953	eng	I think Tom would be hesitant to do that.
6239954	eng	Tom said he didn't know who he should trust.
6239955	eng	I don't have to stay if I don't want to.
6239956	eng	I think Tom won't be in Boston very long.
6239957	eng	Tom said he didn't know anything about that.
6239958	eng	You don't have to do that, but you should.
6239959	eng	I think Tom won't be hesitant to do that.
6239960	eng	Tom said he didn't intend to break the vase.
6239961	eng	You don't have to do that anymore, do you?
6239962	eng	I think Tom will be reluctant to do that.
6239963	eng	Tom said he didn't have any books in French.
6239964	eng	You don't have to be a student to do that.
6239965	eng	I think Tom will be motivated to do that.
6239966	eng	Tom said he did that as quickly as he could.
6239967	eng	You don't have enough time to do that now.
6239968	eng	I think Tom will be doing that on Monday.
6239969	eng	Tom said he couldn't see himself doing that.
6239970	eng	You didn't think I would do that, did you?
6239971	eng	I think Tom will be desperate to do that.
6239972	eng	Tom said he couldn't afford to see a doctor.
6239973	eng	You didn't think I could do that, did you?
6239974	eng	I think Tom stayed in Boston last summer.
6239975	eng	Tom said doing that has made him very happy.
6239976	eng	You didn't look like you were embarrassed.
6239977	eng	I think Tom might visit Boston next week.
6239978	eng	Tom said I shouldn't have bought this house.
6239979	eng	You didn't look like you were discouraged.
6239980	eng	I think Tom is amused by what's going on.
6239981	eng	Tom said Boston was warmer than he expected.
6239982	eng	You didn't know I had to do that, did you?
6239983	eng	I think Tom has some relatives in Boston.
6239984	eng	Tom said Boston was hotter than he expected.
6239985	eng	You didn't do that intentionally, did you?
6239986	eng	I think Tom did that, but I may be wrong.
6239987	eng	Tom said Boston was cooler than he expected.
6239988	eng	You didn't do that for very long, did you?
6239989	eng	I think I'll be able to help Tom do that.
6239990	eng	Tom said Boston was colder than he expected.
6239991	eng	You did that three months ago, didn't you?
6239992	eng	I think I'd better go to Boston with Tom.
6239993	eng	Tom refused my help and did that on his own.
6239994	eng	You did that even better than we expected.
6239995	eng	I think I know why Tom wanted to do that.
6239996	eng	Tom recommends that you not do that anymore.
6239997	eng	You did that about as well as we expected.
6239998	eng	I think I know why Tom needed to do that.
6239999	eng	Tom recommends that you don't do that again.
6240000	eng	You could do that if you really wanted to.
6240001	eng	I still haven't talked to Tom about that.
6240002	eng	Tom ran away from home when he was thirteen.
6240003	eng	You can't speak French very well, can you?
6240004	eng	I shouldn't tell Tom about what happened.
6240005	eng	Tom promised us he wouldn't do that anymore.
6240006	eng	You can study in my office if you want to.
6240007	eng	I should've told Tom not to go to Boston.
6240008	eng	Tom promised that he wouldn't drink anymore.
6240009	eng	You can always try doing that by yourself.
6240010	eng	I should've told Tom about what happened.
6240011	eng	Tom promised that he wouldn't do that again.
6240012	eng	You always do that by yourself, don't you?
6240013	eng	I should've helped Tom with his homework.
6240014	eng	Tom promised that he wouldn't be late again.
6240015	eng	You already know what happened, don't you?
6240016	eng	I should've given Tom a birthday present.
6240017	eng	Tom promised me that everything would be OK.
6240018	eng	Would you like for me to buy that for you?
6240019	eng	I should tell Tom that he has to do that.
6240020	eng	Tom promised me he'd do that, but he didn't.
6240021	eng	Will you really be doing that by yourself?
6240022	eng	I should tell Tom not to do that anymore.
6240023	eng	Tom probably won't want to do that tomorrow.
6240024	eng	Why do you think basketball is so popular?
6240025	eng	I reminded Tom that he needed to do that.
6240026	eng	Tom probably won't do what he says he'll do.
6240027	eng	Why are you sitting there all by yourself?
6240028	eng	I really should go to Boston to help Tom.
6240029	eng	Tom probably won't comment on the situation.
6240030	eng	Who's going to buy the food for the party?
6240031	eng	I promised Tom that I'd do that with him.
6240032	eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that today.
6240033	eng	Who do you think we should ask to help us?
6240034	eng	I often stay with Tom when I'm in Boston.
6240035	eng	Tom probably isn't interested in doing that.
6240036	eng	Which one of your children went to Boston?
6240037	eng	I know you'd never permit Tom to do that.
6240038	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know what happened.
6240039	eng	When was the last time you were this busy?
6240040	eng	I know why Tom isn't supposed to do that.
6240041	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why that happened.
6240042	eng	When was the last time you mowed the lawn?
6240043	eng	I know that Tom is determined to do that.
6240044	eng	Tom probably doesn't know much about sports.
6240045	eng	What's the longest trip you've ever taken?
6240046	eng	I know that Tom has spent time in prison.
6240047	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he should do that.
6240048	eng	What made you think I'd refuse to do that?
6240049	eng	I know Tom will probably want to do that.
6240050	eng	Tom probably doesn't know anything about it.
6240051	eng	What else would you like to see in Boston?
6240052	eng	I know Tom will probably need to do that.
6240053	eng	Tom probably doesn't know a lot about birds.
6240054	eng	Weren't you supposed to do that yesterday?
6240055	eng	I know Tom will probably have to do that.
6240056	eng	Tom only bakes three loaves of bread a week.
6240057	eng	We're likely to be about three hours late.
6240058	eng	I knew that Tom was doing that yesterday.
6240059	eng	Tom once owned a summer home near the beach.
6240060	eng	We probably won't have to do that anymore.
6240061	eng	I knew Tom would likely agree to do that.
6240062	eng	Tom often plays basketball with his friends.
6240063	eng	We only have three hours to get this done.
6240064	eng	I knew Tom would do that sooner or later.
6240065	eng	Tom often goes to the library to read books.
6240066	eng	We need to put new locks on all the doors.
6240067	eng	I hope Tom knows why he needs to do that.
6240068	eng	Tom often complains about pain in his lungs.
6240069	eng	We may stay in Boston for a few more days.
6240070	eng	I hope Tom isn't the next one to do that.
6240071	eng	Tom needs to do that more quickly next time.
6240072	eng	We have to put new locks on all the doors.
6240073	eng	I hope Tom isn't the last one to do that.
6240074	eng	Tom needs to be here again tomorrow at 2:30.
6240075	eng	We had to study French at our high school.
6240076	eng	I hope Tom isn't forgiven for doing that.
6240077	eng	Tom needs to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6240078	eng	This will only take a minute of your time.
6240079	eng	I hope Tom isn't excused from doing that.
6240080	eng	Tom must've sensed this was going to happen.
6240081	eng	This shirt doesn't have a price tag on it.
6240082	eng	I hope Tom is willing to do that with me.
6240083	eng	Tom moved to Boston soon after he graduated.
6240084	eng	This area is famous for its sandy beaches.
6240085	eng	I hope Tom doesn't say he has to do that.
6240086	eng	Tom might get killed if he tries to do that.
6240087	eng	There's someone else doing that right now.
6240088	eng	I helped Tom decorate his Christmas tree.
6240089	eng	Tom looked worried when I said I was scared.
6240090	eng	There's only one more thing we need to do.
6240091	eng	I haven't yet told Tom what I want to do.
6240092	eng	Tom lives on an island in the South Pacific.
6240093	eng	There's only one more thing we have to do.
6240094	eng	I haven't told Tom why I want to do that.
6240095	eng	Tom learned not to do that from his parents.
6240096	eng	There's nothing I can do about that today.
6240097	eng	I haven't told Tom why I need to do that.
6240098	eng	Tom knows how important doing that is to me.
6240099	eng	There's no way I'm going to do that today.
6240100	eng	I haven't told Tom why I have to do that.
6240101	eng	Tom knew how important doing that was to me.
6240102	eng	There's no chance of that happening today.
6240103	eng	I have no idea why Tom wanted to do that.
6240104	eng	Tom isn't very likely to promise to do that.
6240105	eng	There were only three flowers in the vase.
6240106	eng	I have no idea why Tom needed to do that.
6240107	eng	Tom isn't the only one who wants to do that.
6240108	eng	There was nothing you could do about that.
6240109	eng	I have a feeling that Tom has to do that.
6240110	eng	Tom isn't the only one who needs to do that.
6240111	eng	There are a lot of wild ducks around here.
6240112	eng	I forgot I promised Tom that I'd do that.
6240113	eng	Tom isn't likely to be fired for doing that.
6240114	eng	The movie was much better than I expected.
6240115	eng	I don't want to help Tom do that anymore.
6240116	eng	Tom isn't likely to be charged with perjury.
6240117	eng	The man sitting at the counter seemed sad.
6240118	eng	I don't want to go to the dance with Tom.
6240119	eng	Tom isn't likely be arrested for doing that.
6240120	eng	That was a very innovative way to do that.
6240121	eng	I don't want Tom to know what's happened.
6240122	eng	Tom isn't going to be very happy to do that.
6240123	eng	That man left before I could get his name.
6240124	eng	I don't want Tom to go to Boston with me.
6240125	eng	Tom isn't going to be very happy about that.
6240126	eng	Thanks for reminding me about the meeting.
6240127	eng	I don't think Tom would still be nervous.
6240128	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to do that today.
6240129	eng	Since it's raining, I won't do that today.
6240130	eng	I don't think Tom would still be jealous.
6240131	eng	Tom is very busy getting ready for his trip.
6240132	eng	Please show me the easiest way to do that.
6240133	eng	I don't think Tom will forget to do that.
6240134	eng	Tom is unlikely to do what he says he'll do.
6240135	eng	Please remind me to pay the rent tomorrow.
6240136	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that again.
6240137	eng	Tom is too lazy to ever consider doing that.
6240138	eng	Please measure the length of the mattress.
6240139	eng	I don't think Tom should do that outside.
6240140	eng	Tom is too lazy to even consider doing that.
6240141	eng	Please don't do that unless I tell you to.
6240142	eng	I don't think Tom should do that anymore.
6240143	eng	Tom is too classy to do something like that.
6240144	eng	Only a few people did that here yesterday.
6240145	eng	I don't think Tom ought to do that again.
6240146	eng	Tom is the only one who volunteered to help.
6240147	eng	Nobody knows what'll happen in the future.
6240148	eng	I don't think Tom is prepared to do that.
6240149	eng	Tom is the only one here allowed to do that.
6240150	eng	No matter what happens, I want to do that.
6240151	eng	I don't think Tom is finished doing that.
6240152	eng	Tom is the one who should've gone to Boston.
6240153	eng	My wife and I both have driver's licenses.
6240154	eng	I don't think Tom has to do that anymore.
6240155	eng	Tom is the fastest runner on our track team.
6240156	eng	My mother told me that I should come home.
6240157	eng	I don't think Tom expected me to do that.
6240158	eng	Tom is staying in a motel not far from here.
6240159	eng	My mother is three years older than yours.
6240160	eng	I don't think Tom did that intentionally.
6240161	eng	Tom is safe now and that's all that matters.
6240162	eng	My lawyer told me it was legal to do that.
6240163	eng	I don't think Tom can do that by himself.
6240164	eng	Tom is probably going to be able to do that.
6240165	eng	My friend is going to become an architect.
6240166	eng	I don't think I've ever seen Tom do that.
6240167	eng	Tom is playing basketball with some friends.
6240168	eng	My dog sleeps on the floor next to my bed.
6240169	eng	All loves are eternal. What changes is the person.
6240170	eng	I don't think I want to do that with Tom.
6240171	eng	Tom is partly responsible for what happened.
6240172	eng	My dog barks if someone comes to the door.
6240173	eng	I don't remember where Tom told me to go.
6240174	eng	Tom is one of the friendliest people I know.
6240175	eng	My doctor says I don't drink enough water.
6240176	eng	I don't remember the last time I saw Tom.
6240177	eng	Tom is likely to still be irritated by that.
6240178	eng	My doctor advised me to get more exercise.
6240179	eng	I don't need any of the stuff I gave Tom.
6240180	eng	Tom is likely to still be afraid to do that.
6240181	eng	My brothers and sisters are still at home.
6240182	eng	I don't need Tom's permission to do that.
6240183	eng	Tom is likely to feel like doing that today.
6240184	eng	My blood pressure has been lower recently.
6240185	eng	I don't like the way Tom plays the drums.
6240186	eng	Tom is likely to be the next one to do that.
6240187	eng	Men and women usually do that differently.
6240188	eng	I don't like the way Tom makes spaghetti.
6240189	eng	Tom is likely to be the last one to do that.
6240190	eng	Many of the fish in my aquarium have died.
6240191	eng	I don't like cats and Tom doesn't either.
6240192	eng	Tom is likely to be forgiven for doing that.
6240193	eng	Let's find a good place to pitch our tent.
6240194	eng	I don't like beef and Tom doesn't either.
6240195	eng	Tom is likely to be excused from doing that.
6240196	eng	Landscaping is my profession and my hobby.
6240197	eng	I don't know why Tom should've done that.
6240198	eng	Tom is hoping that it doesn't rain tomorrow.
6240199	eng	It's not safe to drink the tap water here.
6240200	eng	I don't know why Tom asked me to do that.
6240201	eng	Tom is having a really hard time doing that.
6240202	eng	It's illegal to do that in many countries.
6240203	eng	I don't know who Tom is going to talk to.
6240204	eng	Tom is going to be questioned by the police.
6240205	eng	It's already time for us to do that again.
6240206	eng	I don't know whether Tom likes me or not.
6240207	eng	Tom is going out to buy some things we need.
6240208	eng	It's almost time for the meeting to start.
6240209	eng	I don't know whether Tom is tired or not.
6240210	eng	Tom is an incredibly talented ballet dancer.
6240211	eng	It's Monday that you're leaving, isn't it?
6240212	eng	I don't know whether Tom did that or not.
6240213	eng	Tom is able to do that with his eyes closed.
6240214	eng	It'll probably be safe for you to do that.
6240215	eng	I don't know whether Tom can swim or not.
6240217	eng	It'll probably be easy for you to do that.
6240218	eng	I don't know where Tom put his suitcases.
6240219	eng	Tom insisted he wasn't the one who did that.
6240220	eng	It'll be easier to do that than you think.
6240221	eng	I don't know where Tom is planning to go.
6240222	eng	Tom injured himself while trying to do that.
6240223	eng	It would be very irresponsible to do that.
6240224	eng	I don't know what kind of food Tom likes.
6240225	eng	Tom hung the wet clothes on the clothesline.
6240226	eng	It would be unsafe to do that by yourself.
6240227	eng	I don't know what Tom thinks I should do.
6240228	eng	Tom hung his wet clothes on the clothesline.
6240229	eng	It would be stupid to do that by yourself.
6240230	eng	I don't know the reason why Tom was late.
6240231	eng	Tom hoped he wouldn't miss any more classes.
6240232	eng	It would be interesting to try doing that.
6240233	eng	I don't know anything about Tom's family.
6240234	eng	Tom hasn't told us what he's supposed to do.
6240235	eng	It would be fantastic if we could do that.
6240236	eng	I don't have Tom's permission to do that.
6240237	eng	Tom hasn't taken a shower since last Monday.
6240238	eng	It would be disappointing if you did that.
6240239	eng	I don't care who Tom goes to Boston with.
6240240	eng	Tom hasn't done as much as you think he has.
6240241	eng	It would be a terrible mistake to do that.
6240242	eng	I don't care what kind of car Tom drives.
6240243	eng	Tom has written several books on volleyball.
6240244	eng	It was your children who were misbehaving.
6240245	eng	I don't care what Tom does or doesn't do.
6240246	eng	Tom has vowed that he won't do that anymore.
6240247	eng	It was very kind of you to do that for us.
6240248	eng	I don't care anymore what happens to Tom.
6240249	eng	Tom has to be gone by the time we get there.
6240250	eng	It was very considerate of you to do that.
6240251	eng	I don't believe Tom would really do that.
6240252	eng	Tom has survived three attempts on his life.
6240253	eng	It took us years to complete that project.
6240254	eng	I didn't warn Tom that this might happen.
6240255	eng	Tom has run this restaurant for three years.
6240256	eng	It should've been a lot easier to do that.
6240257	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom where I'd been.
6240258	eng	Tom has played the trombone for a few years.
6240259	eng	It rained every day while I was in Boston.
6240260	eng	I didn't want to show Tom how to do that.
6240261	eng	Tom has planted roses in front of his house.
6240262	eng	It probably won't be expensive to do that.
6240263	eng	I didn't want to share my lunch with Tom.
6240264	eng	Tom has managed to do that without any help.
6240265	eng	It probably won't be dangerous to do that.
6240266	eng	I didn't think that Tom knew how to swim.
6240267	eng	Tom has hardly studied at all this semester.
6240268	eng	It isn't going to be very easy to do that.
6240269	eng	I didn't think Tom would want to do that.
6240270	eng	Tom has had plenty of time to get that done.
6240271	eng	Is there a clock on your dining room wall?
6240272	eng	I didn't think Tom would need to do that.
6240273	eng	Tom has done everything we wanted him to do.
6240274	eng	If you won't come to me, I'll come to you.
6240275	eng	I didn't think Tom would like to do that.
6240276	eng	Tom has been working for us for a long time.
6240277	eng	If you don't me to do that again, I won't.
6240278	eng	I didn't think Tom would like my friends.
6240279	eng	Tom has been told to do that more than once.
6240280	eng	If you do that every day, you'll get sick.
6240281	eng	I didn't think Tom would let you do that.
6240282	eng	Tom has been told that he needs to pay more.
6240283	eng	If we had done that, it would've been fun.
6240284	eng	I didn't think Tom would have to do that.
6240285	eng	Tom has been told not to do that by himself.
6240286	eng	If it's raining tomorrow, I won't do that.
6240287	eng	I didn't think Tom would enjoy our party.
6240288	eng	Tom has been listening to the radio all day.
6240289	eng	I've tried many different ways to do that.
6240290	eng	I didn't think Tom would be that unlucky.
6240291	eng	Tom has been in the garden planting flowers.
6240292	eng	I've only lived in Boston for three years.
6240293	eng	I didn't think Tom would be here so soon.
6240294	eng	Tom has been in his room listening to music.
6240295	eng	I've only been doing this for three hours.
6240296	eng	I didn't think Tom would be back so soon.
6240297	eng	Tom has been in Boston visiting his parents.
6240298	eng	I've only been a widower for three months.
6240299	eng	I didn't think Tom was interested in art.
6240300	eng	Tom has been here for just over three years.
6240301	eng	I've never been criticized for doing that.
6240302	eng	I didn't think Tom really had to do that.
6240303	eng	Tom has been getting a lot of the attention.
6240304	eng	I've been playing chess since I was a kid.
6240305	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I'd gone to Boston.
6240306	eng	Tom has been doing that for three years now.
6240307	eng	I've been having fun hanging out with you.
6240308	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I had to work late.
6240309	eng	Tom has been arrested three times this year.
6240310	eng	I've already visited Boston several times.
6240311	eng	I didn't tell Tom what needed to be done.
6240312	eng	Tom has been advised to go on a strict diet.
6240313	eng	I'm too smart to do something that stupid.
6240314	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he needed to know.
6240315	eng	Tom has been accused of premeditated murder.
6240316	eng	I'm the only one who knows how to do that.
6240317	eng	I didn't tell Tom that this might happen.
6240318	eng	Tom has asked me to show you how to do that.
6240319	eng	I'm the only one who didn't pass the test.
6240320	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I didn't like him.
6240321	eng	Tom had three daughters who became teachers.
6240322	eng	I'm the only one here not able to do that.
6240323	eng	I didn't realize Tom knew how to do that.
6240324	eng	Tom had a second helping of mashed potatoes.
6240325	eng	I'm the one responsible for what happened.
6240326	eng	I didn't notice Tom hiding in the bushes.
6240327	eng	Tom got very sick and has been hospitalized.
6240328	eng	I'm really glad I wasn't asked to do that.
6240329	eng	I didn't like Tom then and I still don't.
6240330	eng	Tom goes to the hospital three times a week.
6240331	eng	I'm not the only one who wants to do that.
6240332	eng	I didn't know why Tom refused to do that.
6240333	eng	Tom fell in love with a woman twice his age.
6240334	eng	I'm not the only one who needs to do that.
6240335	eng	I didn't know when Tom would be arriving.
6240336	eng	Tom explained why he wasn't able to do that.
6240337	eng	I'm not the only one permitted to do that.
6240338	eng	I didn't know that you were Tom's sister.
6240339	eng	Tom explained why he didn't want to do that.
6240340	eng	I'm not sure whether I can do that or not.
6240341	eng	I didn't know that you were Tom's cousin.
6240342	eng	Tom expects us do the same thing he's doing.
6240343	eng	I'm not likely go to Boston until October.
6240344	eng	I didn't know that you loved Tom so much.
6240345	eng	Tom eventually admitted that he'd done that.
6240346	eng	I'm going to be quite happy here, I think.
6240347	eng	I didn't know that you hated Tom so much.
6240348	eng	Tom drank a whole bottle of wine by himself.
6240349	eng	I'm glad we stayed in Boston an extra day.
6240350	eng	I didn't know that Tom wouldn't be there.
6240351	eng	Tom doesn't yet realize what he needs to do.
6240352	eng	I'm glad I didn't go to Boston last month.
6240353	eng	I didn't know that Tom wanted me to stay.
6240354	eng	Tom doesn't want us to do that by ourselves.
6240355	eng	I'll make sure that I never do that again.
6240356	eng	I didn't know that Tom understood French.
6240357	eng	Tom doesn't want to show you how to do that.
6240358	eng	I'll go to Boston sometime before October.
6240359	eng	I didn't know that Tom had so much money.
6240360	eng	Tom doesn't want to learn how to do that.
6240361	eng	I'll be very disappointed if that happens.
6240362	eng	I didn't know Tom was such a good clarinetist.
6240363	eng	Tom doesn't think you're allowed to do that.
6240364	eng	I'll be the only one permitted to do that.
6240365	eng	I didn't know Tom was living in the dorm.
6240366	eng	Tom doesn't think we really need to do that.
6240367	eng	I'll be staying in Boston for three weeks.
6240368	eng	I didn't know Tom very well at that time.
6240369	eng	Tom doesn't think we really have to do that.
6240370	eng	I'd rather do that now before it gets hot.
6240371	eng	I didn't know Tom used to live in Boston.
6240372	eng	Tom doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
6240373	eng	I'd go to Boston right away if I were you.
6240374	eng	I didn't know Tom thought I should leave.
6240375	eng	Tom doesn't think he's ready to do that yet.
6240376	eng	I'd be very thankful if you could do that.
6240377	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
6240378	eng	Tom doesn't think he's permitted to do that.
6240379	eng	I'd be very grateful if you could do that.
6240380	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't need to do that.
6240381	eng	Tom doesn't think he needs to do that today.
6240382	eng	I'd be self-conscious if I had to do that.
6240383	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't have to do that.
6240384	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be doing that very well.
6240385	eng	I'd be disappointed if you didn't do that.
6240386	eng	I didn't know Tom and John were brothers.
6240387	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be an easy-going person.
6240388	eng	I wouldn't try doing that if I were drunk.
6240389	eng	I didn't invite Tom to my birthday party.
6240390	eng	Tom doesn't seem like he's much happier now.
6240391	eng	I wouldn't be here if I didn't want to be.
6240392	eng	I didn't help Tom as much as I should've.
6240393	eng	Tom doesn't really want to do that, does he?
6240394	eng	I wouldn't be here if I didn't need to be.
6240395	eng	I didn't have to wait for Tom, but I did.
6240396	eng	Tom doesn't really need to do that, does he?
6240397	eng	I would've done that if you'd asked me to.
6240398	eng	I didn't give Tom the money he asked for.
6240399	eng	Tom doesn't really have to do that, does he?
6240400	eng	I wonder if doing that would be dangerous.
6240401	eng	I didn't give Tom anything for Christmas.
6240402	eng	Tom doesn't really enjoy doing that anymore.
6240403	eng	I won't permit you to continue doing that.
6240404	eng	I didn't expect to fall in love with Tom.
6240405	eng	Tom doesn't need to get up so early anymore.
6240406	eng	I won't go swimming unless you go with me.
6240407	eng	I didn't expect Tom to refuse to do that.
6240408	eng	Tom doesn't need any help with his homework.
6240409	eng	I wish you loved me as much as I love you.
6240410	eng	I didn't expect Tom to react like he did.
6240411	eng	Tom doesn't like people who aren't punctual.
6240412	eng	I wish there were more I could do to help.
6240413	eng	I didn't buy Tom what I promised I'd buy.
6240414	eng	Tom doesn't leave the house without his dog.
6240415	eng	I wish I'd listened to my father's advice.
6240416	eng	I didn't apologize to Tom for doing that.
6240417	eng	Tom doesn't know why you want me to do that.
6240418	eng	I wish I'd been healthy enough to do that.
6240419	eng	I didn't actually do what Tom said I did.
6240420	eng	Tom doesn't know what you're planning to do.
6240421	eng	I wish I had the chance to try doing that.
6240422	eng	I did my best to persuade Tom to do that.
6240423	eng	Tom doesn't know what to expect around here.
6240424	eng	I was hoping you'd show me how to do that.
6240425	eng	I did almost the same thing that Tom did.
6240426	eng	Tom doesn't know that I hardly ever do that.
6240427	eng	I wanted to do that, but I wasn't able to.
6240428	eng	I crept downstairs after Tom fell asleep.
6240429	eng	Tom doesn't know that I don't often do that.
6240430	eng	I want to stay with you until next Monday.
6240431	eng	I could never forgive Tom if he did that.
6240432	eng	Tom doesn't know much about classical music.
6240433	eng	I want to see you in my office right away.
6240434	eng	I can't speak French and neither can Tom.
6240435	eng	Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that again.
6240436	eng	I want to know when you're going to start.
6240437	eng	I can't believe Tom would really do that.
6240438	eng	Tom doesn't have much money, but he gets by.
6240439	eng	I want to know when you're going to leave.
6240440	eng	I bought this car from Tom for only $300.
6240441	eng	Tom doesn't have much experience doing that.
6240442	eng	I want to know when we're going to Boston.
6240443	eng	I bet Tom won't go to Boston next summer.
6240444	eng	Tom doesn't have as much experience as I do.
6240445	eng	I want to know if you'll be ready by 2:30.
6240446	eng	I assume Tom would be willing to do that.
6240447	eng	Tom doesn't eat any fish except canned tuna.
6240450	eng	Tom doesn't care whether you do that or not.
6240451	eng	I want to know how much ice cream you ate.
6240452	eng	How many months has Tom spent doing that?
6240453	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be having a good time.
6240454	eng	I usually use margarine instead of butter.
6240455	eng	How many minutes has Tom been doing that?
6240456	eng	Tom doesn't actually live in Boston anymore.
6240457	eng	I understand that you've begun to do that.
6240458	eng	How many hours do you think Tom did that?
6240459	eng	Tom does almost everything he's asked to do.
6240460	eng	I try to always remember to say thank you.
6240461	eng	How many days did it take Tom to do that?
6240462	eng	Tom didn't want to spend all day at the zoo.
6240463	eng	I thought you'd be doing that by yourself.
6240465	eng	Tom didn't want me to go to Boston with him.
6240466	eng	I thought you weren't supposed to do that.
6240467	eng	How did you persuade Tom to go to Boston?
6240468	eng	Tom didn't think it would be a long meeting.
6240469	eng	I thought you weren't finished doing that.
6240470	eng	How did you know what else Tom had to do?
6240471	eng	Tom didn't tell me why he wanted to do that.
6240472	eng	I thought you said you'd probably do that.
6240473	eng	How did you convince Tom to go to Boston?
6240474	eng	Tom didn't tell me why he needed to do that.
6240475	eng	I thought you said you'd do that tomorrow.
6240476	eng	Have you already told Tom how to do that?
6240477	eng	Tom didn't seem to know about what happened.
6240478	eng	I thought you said you'd do that for sure.
6240479	eng	Everything that happened was Tom's fault.
6240480	eng	Tom didn't seem amused by what was going on.
6240481	eng	I thought you said you'd do that for free.
6240482	eng	Doing that would probably make Tom happy.
6240483	eng	Tom didn't know we were supposed to do that.
6240484	eng	I thought you said you only did that once.
6240485	eng	Doing that got Tom three years in prison.
6240486	eng	Tom didn't know that I was a French teacher.
6240487	eng	I thought you said you had fun doing that.
6240488	eng	Does Tom still go to Boston every summer?
6240489	eng	Tom didn't know he no longer had to do that.
6240490	eng	I thought you said you enjoyed doing that.
6240491	eng	Does Tom have to stay in Boston all week?
6240492	eng	Tom didn't know he had done something wrong.
6240493	eng	I thought you said you did that on Monday.
6240494	eng	Do you think Tom would permit me do that?
6240495	eng	Tom didn't know anything about this, did he?
6240496	eng	I thought that I wouldn't need to do that.
6240497	eng	Do you know the reason why Tom is crying?
6240498	eng	Tom didn't do everything we asked him to do.
6240499	eng	I thought that I wouldn't have to do that.
6240500	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to do that?
6240501	eng	Tom didn't actually want to do that, did he?
6240502	eng	I thought it would be possible to do that.
6240503	eng	Didn't you know that Tom owned a scooter?
6240504	eng	Tom did that in only a fraction of a second.
6240505	eng	I thought doing that might be a good idea.
6240506	eng	Didn't you know that Tom moved to Boston?
6240507	eng	Tom did everything he promised to do for me.
6240508	eng	I thought I'd be able to help you do that.
6240509	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still doing that?
6240510	eng	Tom denies that he was the one who did that.
6240511	eng	I thought I was smarter than anybody else.
6240512	eng	Didn't you know Tom was living in Boston?
6240513	eng	Tom denied that he was the one who did that.
6240514	eng	I thought I was going to have a good time.
6240515	eng	Didn't you know Tom was going to be late?
6240516	eng	Tom deleted all the pictures from his phone.
6240517	eng	I think you'd probably be able to do that.
6240518	eng	Didn't you know Tom was allergic to nuts?
6240519	eng	Tom couldn't have done that without my help.
6240520	eng	I think we ought to be speaking in French.
6240521	eng	Didn't you know Tom lived on Park Street?
6240522	eng	Tom couldn't figure out how to open the box.
6240523	eng	I think it's probably possible to do that.
6240524	eng	Didn't you know Tom doesn't like driving?
6240525	eng	Tom could've solved that problem by himself.
6240526	eng	I think it's probably not wise to do that.
6240527	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't like baseball?
6240528	eng	Tom could've done that, but he chose not to.
6240529	eng	I think it's probably not safe to do that.
6240530	eng	Did you know that Tom saw you doing that?
6240531	eng	Tom could've done that if he'd tried harder.
6240532	eng	I think it's probably not easy to do that.
6240533	eng	Did you know that Tom owned a motorcycle?
6240534	eng	Tom could've been troubled by what happened.
6240535	eng	I think it would be a bad idea to do that.
6240536	eng	Did you know Tom would refuse to do that?
6240537	eng	Tom could've been first if he'd asked to be.
6240538	eng	I think I should send a letter of apology.
6240539	eng	Did you know Tom wasn't going to do that?
6240540	eng	Tom could probably teach you how to do that.
6240541	eng	I think I might not have to do that again.
6240542	eng	Did you know Tom was planning to do that?
6240543	eng	Tom could be self-conscious, but I doubt it.
6240544	eng	I think I might not be allowed to do that.
6240545	eng	Did you know Tom was allergic to peanuts?
6240546	eng	Tom cooks for us three or four times a week.
6240547	eng	I think I might have to do that by myself.
6240548	eng	Did you know Tom had relatives in Boston?
6240549	eng	Tom complained about pain in his lower back.
6240550	eng	I sure wouldn't want to do that by myself.
6240551	eng	Did you know Tom didn't enjoy doing that?
6240552	eng	Tom complained about how salty the food was.
6240553	eng	I sure I won't be the last one to do that.
6240554	eng	Did Tom ask you to go to Boston with him?
6240555	eng	Tom clapped his hands and the light came on.
6240556	eng	I sure I won't be allowed to do that here.
6240557	eng	You're the only person who can help Tom.
6240558	eng	Tom came into the room and started shouting.
6240559	eng	I still have a lot of things I want to do.
6240560	eng	You're a lot older than Tom, aren't you?
6240561	eng	Tom burned all the letters in the fireplace.
6240562	eng	I still have a lot of things I need to do.
6240563	eng	You wouldn't let Tom do that, would you?
6240564	eng	Tom buried the stolen money in his backyard.
6240565	eng	I still have a lot of things I have to do.
6240566	eng	You won't be able to get Tom to do that.
6240567	eng	Tom beat the rug with his old tennis racket.
6240568	eng	I still go to Boston several times a year.
6240569	eng	You think Tom should do that, don't you?
6240570	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't come to his party.
6240571	eng	I shouldn't have permitted you to do that.
6240572	eng	You shouldn't have asked Tom to do that.
6240573	eng	Tom asked if he really had to do that today.
6240574	eng	I shouldn't have gone to Boston by myself.
6240575	eng	You should've stayed in Boston with Tom.
6240576	eng	Tom asked if he had to do that this morning.
6240577	eng	I should've gone to the dentist last week.
6240578	eng	You should've asked Tom why he did that.
6240579	eng	Tom and his parents are in Boston this week.
6240580	eng	I should've been the first one to do that.
6240581	eng	You should tell Tom you want to do that.
6240582	eng	Tom and his mother are waiting on the porch.
6240583	eng	I should be gone by the time you get here.
6240584	eng	You should tell Tom you need to do that.
6240585	eng	Tom and I work together at the same company.
6240586	eng	I sat as close to the fire as I could get.
6240587	eng	You should tell Tom you have to do that.
6240588	eng	Tom and I were the last two people to leave.
6240589	eng	I really don't want to go to school today.
6240590	eng	You should tell Tom he needs to do that.
6240591	eng	Tom and I wanted to go on a picnic together.
6240592	eng	I really don't feel like doing that today.
6240593	eng	You should probably tell Tom to do that.
6240594	eng	Tom and I studied French together yesterday.
6240595	eng	I realize I don't have to do that anymore.
6240596	eng	You should give Tom a chance to do that.
6240597	eng	Tom and I sometimes play badminton together.
6240598	eng	I pretended that I didn't know the answer.
6240599	eng	You should do that before Tom gets here.
6240600	eng	Tom and I sat next to each other on the bus.
6240601	eng	I plan to study in Boston for three years.
6240602	eng	You knew Tom should do that, didn't you?
6240603	eng	Tom and I have been enemies for a long time.
6240604	eng	I only have three fish in my aquarium now.
6240605	eng	You knew Tom had to do that, didn't you?
6240606	eng	Tom and I don't very often do that together.
6240607	eng	I never thought I'd need to do that again.
6240608	eng	You hope Tom doesn't do that, don't you?
6240609	eng	Tom and I don't speak to each other anymore.
6240610	eng	I never thought I'd have to do that again.
6240611	eng	You expected Tom to do that, didn't you?
6240612	eng	Tom and I don't like the same kind of music.
6240613	eng	I needed some cash, so I went to the bank.
6240614	eng	You don't think Tom can do that, do you?
6240615	eng	Tom and I don't know what we should do next.
6240616	eng	I need to find a solution to that problem.
6240617	eng	You don't really understand Tom, do you?
6240618	eng	Tom and I didn't say anything to each other.
6240619	eng	I might stay in Boston for a night or two.
6240620	eng	You don't know why Tom did that, do you?
6240621	eng	Tom and I are having a party tomorrow night.
6240622	eng	I may need to stay in Boston until Monday.
6240623	eng	You don't know how Tom did that, do you?
6240624	eng	Tom and I are going to a dance this evening.
6240625	eng	I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror.
6240626	eng	You don't expect Tom to do that, do you?
6240627	eng	Tom and I are getting ready to go to Boston.
6240628	eng	I hope you don't get fired for doing that.
6240629	eng	You don't do that the same way Tom does.
6240630	eng	Tom and I almost never do anything together.
6240631	eng	I hope you don't get fined for doing that.
6240632	eng	You don't care if Tom does that, do you?
6240633	eng	Tom always seems to be using his smartphone.
6240634	eng	I hope you can come to Boston next summer.
6240635	eng	You do hope Tom will do that, don't you?
6240636	eng	Tom always leaves for work just before 6:30.
6240637	eng	I hope that I don't have to do that again.
6240638	eng	You didn't tell Tom to do that, did you?
6240639	eng	Tom always does that when he goes to Boston.
6240640	eng	I haven't yet done what you told me to do.
6240641	eng	You didn't give Tom a chance to do that.
6240642	eng	Tom almost killed himself trying to do that.
6240643	eng	I haven't yet done everything I should do.
6240644	eng	You can likely talk Tom into doing that.
6240645	eng	Tom advised me on which stocks I should buy.
6240646	eng	I have to find a solution to that problem.
6240647	eng	Why isn't Tom coming to Boston with you?
6240648	eng	Tom Jackson is one of my favorite comedians.
6240649	eng	I go to Boston three or four times a year.
6240650	eng	Why is Tom afraid to swim in this river?
6240651	eng	Tom's parents got divorced three years ago.
6240652	eng	I found the sunglasses I thought I'd lost.
6240653	eng	Why don't you want to go to Tom's party?
6240654	eng	Tom's office doesn't look like mine at all.
6240655	eng	I felt ashamed because I couldn't do that.
6240656	eng	Who told you Tom would enjoy doing that?
6240657	eng	Tom wouldn't let me do what I wanted to do.
6240659	eng	Who told you Tom didn't want to do that?
6240660	eng	Tom wouldn't have permitted you to do that.
6240661	eng	I doubt that I'll get a chance to do that.
6240662	eng	Who told you Tom didn't need to do that?
6240663	eng	Tom wouldn't have let his children do that.
6240664	eng	I don't yet know exactly what I should do.
6240665	eng	Who told you Tom didn't have to do that?
6240666	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if he had to do that.
6240667	eng	I don't want to think about the situation.
6240668	eng	Who did Tom say went to Boston with him?
6240669	eng	Tom would like to ask you how you did that.
6240670	eng	I don't want to stop doing what I'm doing.
6240671	eng	When did you find out Tom had been hurt?
6240672	eng	Tom worked for three hours without a break.
6240673	eng	I don't want to stay in Boston any longer.
6240674	eng	What was Tom doing in Boston last month?
6240675	eng	Tom won't likely try to do that on his own.
6240676	eng	I don't want to make a big deal out of it.
6240677	eng	Were you with Tom when he broke his leg?
6240678	eng	Tom won't likely be through doing that yet.
6240679	eng	I don't want to do that without some help.
6240680	eng	We need to make sure that Tom does that.
6240681	eng	Tom won't likely be in Boston next weekend.
6240682	eng	I don't want to do that as much as you do.
6240683	eng	We have to make sure that Tom does that.
6240684	eng	Tom won't likely be annoyed if you do that.
6240685	eng	I don't want anyone to know that I'm rich.
6240686	eng	We have to do that before Tom gets here.
6240687	eng	Tom won't forgive you if you do that again.
6240688	eng	I don't understand why I ought to do that.
6240689	eng	The last time I saw Tom he was barefoot.
6240690	eng	Tom won't be very interested in doing that.
6240691	eng	I don't think you should agree to do that.
6240692	eng	That's exactly what Tom said to me, too.
6240693	eng	Tom won't be very hungry when he gets home.
6240694	eng	I don't think we're capable of doing that.
6240695	eng	Please tell Tom he should wear a helmet.
6240696	eng	Tom won't be ready to do that until Monday.
6240697	eng	I don't think that'll happen anytime soon.
6240698	eng	Please tell Tom he has to do that today.
6240699	eng	Tom will probably be ready to do that soon.
6240700	eng	I don't think it's a good idea to do that.
6240701	eng	Please tell Tom he doesn't need to wait.
6240702	eng	Tom will probably be in Boston next Monday.
6240703	eng	I don't think it would be safe to do that.
6240704	eng	Please tell Tom I won't do that anymore.
6240705	eng	Tom will probably be determined to do that.
6240706	eng	I don't think it would be rude to do that.
6240707	eng	Please tell Tom I need to do that today.
6240708	eng	Tom will never permit you to do that again.
6240709	eng	I don't think it would be easy to do that.
6240710	eng	Please tell Tom I don't need to do that.
6240711	eng	Tom will likely be tired when he gets home.
6240712	eng	I don't think I'll be in Boston next week.
6240713	eng	Please tell Tom I don't have to do that.
6240714	eng	Tom will likely be the next one to do that.
6240715	eng	I don't think I'd ever be able to do that.
6240716	eng	Please find out what Tom wants us to do.
6240717	eng	Tom will likely be the last one to do that.
6240718	eng	I don't think I should go there by myself.
6240719	eng	Please do that with Tom or someone else.
6240720	eng	Tom will likely be excused from doing that.
6240721	eng	I don't think I could ever live in Boston.
6240722	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't play tennis anymore.
6240723	eng	Tom will catch the next bus to the airport.
6240724	eng	I don't think I could ever commit suicide.
6240725	eng	Maybe Tom won't finish doing that today.
6240726	eng	Tom will be very careful when he does that.
6240727	eng	I don't remember where I left my umbrella.
6240728	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know how to play jazz.
6240730	eng	I don't really want to go to school today.
6240731	eng	It's uncertain whether Tom will do that.
6240732	eng	Tom will be punished if he does that again.
6240733	eng	I don't really feel like doing that today.
6240734	eng	It's been decided that Tom will do that.
6240735	eng	Tom will be miserable in this kind of heat.
6240736	eng	I don't play tennis as often as I used to.
6240737	eng	It took Tom over three hours to do that.
6240738	eng	Tom will be leaving for Australia tomorrow.
6240739	eng	I don't need to know who gave that to you.
6240740	eng	It seems that Tom won't do that anymore.
6240741	eng	Tom will be absent both today and tomorrow.
6240742	eng	I don't like to leave anything unfinished.
6240743	eng	It looks like Tom knows what he's doing.
6240744	eng	Tom will be able to do that today, I think.
6240745	eng	I don't like sitting in the back of a bus.
6240746	eng	It looks like Tom is having a good time.
6240747	eng	Tom went to Boston to promote his new book.
6240748	eng	I don't like people telling me what to do.
6240749	eng	It looks like Tom has lost a few pounds.
6240750	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who had to do that.
6240751	eng	I don't like being told when to go to bed.
6240752	eng	Is Tom going to play the guitar tonight?
6240753	eng	Tom wasn't the only one allowed to do that.
6240754	eng	I don't know who to give this envelope to.
6240755	eng	If you don't do that, Tom will be upset.
6240756	eng	Tom wasn't the first one to try to do that.
6240757	eng	I don't know whether I can do that or not.
6240758	eng	If it rains, Tom probably won't do that.
6240759	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to do that, but he did.
6240760	eng	I don't know what time I need to be there.
6240761	eng	If Tom can do that, I probably can, too.
6240762	eng	Tom was trying to ignore what was going on.
6240763	eng	I don't know what I'm doing half the time.
6240764	eng	I've persuaded Tom not to do that again.
6240765	eng	Tom was the only other person who did that.
6240766	eng	I don't know anything about the situation.
6240767	eng	I've been asked not to help Tom do that.
6240768	eng	Tom was the only one who wanted to do that.
6240769	eng	I don't have to go there unless I want to.
6240770	eng	I'm tired of waiting for Tom to do that.
6240771	eng	Tom was the only one who needed to do that.
6240772	eng	I don't have enough time to do that today.
6240773	eng	I'm the one who told Tom how to do that.
6240774	eng	Tom was the one who inspired me to do that.
6240775	eng	I don't have enough money to go to Boston.
6240776	eng	I'm sure Tom will permit you to do that.
6240777	eng	Tom was the one who helped me buy this car.
6240778	eng	I don't have enough money to buy a ticket.
6240779	eng	I'm sure Tom will be fascinated by that.
6240780	eng	Tom was the first one to decide to do that.
6240781	eng	I don't have as much experience as you do.
6240782	eng	I'm sure Tom has the ability to do that.
6240783	eng	Tom was my neighbor when I lived in Boston.
6240784	eng	I don't have any time, so I won't do that.
6240785	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be outside.
6240786	eng	Tom was much taller than I thought he'd be.
6240787	eng	I don't have any friends who speak French.
6240788	eng	I'm really glad that Tom didn't do that.
6240789	eng	Tom was much busier than I thought he'd be.
6240790	eng	I don't have any friends who like camping.
6240791	eng	I'm pretty sure it was Tom who did that.
6240792	eng	Tom was much bigger than I thought he'd be.
6240793	eng	I don't have any enemies I can think of.
6240794	eng	I'm glad Tom is here to help us do that.
6240795	eng	Tom was hoping we wouldn't need to do that.
6240796	eng	I didn't want to spend all day doing that.
6240797	eng	I'll make sure that Tom doesn't do that.
6240798	eng	Tom was hoping we wouldn't have to do that.
6240799	eng	I didn't want to spend all day at the zoo.
6240800	eng	I'll help Tom figure out how to do that.
6240801	eng	Tom was hoping he wouldn't need to do that.
6240802	eng	I didn't want to sell any of my paintings.
6240803	eng	I'd never do that the way Tom suggested.
6240804	eng	Tom was hoping he wouldn't have to do that.
6240805	eng	I didn't want to jump into the cold water.
6240806	eng	I'd like to know why Tom had to do that.
6240807	eng	Tom was doing that all yesterday afternoon.
6240808	eng	I didn't want to feed my dog dry dog food.
6240809	eng	I'd help Tom do that if he wanted me to.
6240810	eng	Tom was already doing that when I got here.
6240811	eng	I didn't want to call attention to myself.
6240812	eng	I'd be able to do that if Tom helped me.
6240813	eng	Tom wants to know when you'll go to Boston.
6240814	eng	I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
6240815	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if Tom did that.
6240816	eng	Tom very seldom does that in the afternoon.
6240817	eng	I didn't want anyone to see me doing that.
6240818	eng	I wonder why Tom never learned to drive.
6240819	eng	Tom very frequently does that after dinner.
6240820	eng	I didn't think you'd be busy this morning.
6240821	eng	I wonder why Tom didn't need to do that.
6240822	eng	Tom tried to discourage me from doing that.
6240823	eng	I didn't think we were violating any laws.
6240824	eng	I wonder why Tom didn't have to do that.
6240825	eng	Tom told me that he's reluctant to do that.
6240826	eng	I didn't think that movie was interesting.
6240827	eng	I wonder whether Tom did that yesterday.
6240828	eng	Tom told me that he's motivated to do that.
6240829	eng	I didn't see any bullet holes in the wall.
6240830	eng	I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
6240831	eng	Tom told me that he's desperate to do that.
6240832	eng	I didn't run fast enough to catch the bus.
6240834	eng	Tom told me that he'll be here early today.
6240835	eng	I didn't really think I'd need to do that.
6240836	eng	I went downstairs after Tom fell asleep.
6240837	eng	Tom told me that he thought I looked drunk.
6240838	eng	I didn't really think I'd have to do that.
6240839	eng	I wasn't the one who helped Tom do that.
6240840	eng	Tom told me that he had decided to do that.
6240841	eng	I didn't really think I needed to do that.
6240842	eng	I was surprised that Tom had to do that.
6240843	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't do that by himself.
6240844	eng	I didn't really feel like drinking coffee.
6240845	eng	I was impressed by the way Tom did that.
6240846	eng	Tom told me he was sick, which wasn't true.
6240847	eng	I didn't realize that there was a problem.
6240848	eng	I wanted all the same things Tom wanted.
6240849	eng	Tom told me he sells about 300 cars a year.
6240850	eng	I didn't pay any attention to the warning.
6240851	eng	I wanted Tom to teach me how to do that.
6240852	eng	Tom told me he needed to borrow some money.
6240853	eng	I didn't notice that my shoes were untied.
6240854	eng	I want to know if you've heard from Tom.
6240855	eng	Tom told me he didn't have time to do that.
6240856	eng	I didn't notice that I was being followed.
6240857	eng	I want to know how much money Tom spent.
6240858	eng	Tom told me he didn't feel like doing that.
6240859	eng	I didn't like to do that when I was a kid.
6240860	eng	I told Tom that I wouldn't go to Boston.
6240861	eng	Tom told me I could do that if I wanted to.
6240862	eng	I didn't know you were living in the dorm.
6240863	eng	I told Tom that I thought I had the flu.
6240864	eng	Tom thought he wouldn't be able to do that.
6240865	eng	I didn't know who to give the envelope to.
6240866	eng	I told Tom that I don't have to do that.
6240867	eng	Tom taught me how to swim the breaststroke.
6240868	eng	I didn't know that the deadline was today.
6240869	eng	I told Tom I wouldn't be at the meeting.
6240870	eng	Tom succeeded because he had a lot of help.
6240871	eng	I didn't know that I had to do that today.
6240872	eng	I told Tom I thought I couldn't do that.
6240873	eng	Tom still hasn't given me what I asked for.
6240874	eng	I didn't know Mary and Alice were sisters.
6240875	eng	I told Tom I don't have time to do that.
6240876	eng	Tom still has a lot of things he has to do.
6240877	eng	I didn't have to get up as early as I did.
6240878	eng	I told Tom I didn't need to do anything.
6240879	eng	Tom still doesn't want to do that, does he?
6240880	eng	I didn't have time to do what I had to do.
6240881	eng	I told Tom I didn't know where he lived.
6240882	eng	Tom still doesn't need to do that, does he?
6240883	eng	I didn't have time to do the job properly.
6240884	eng	I told Tom I didn't have to do anything.
6240885	eng	Tom still doesn't have to do that, does he?
6240886	eng	I didn't have the right tools for the job.
6240887	eng	I told Tom I didn't have anything to do.
6240888	eng	Tom stayed up until 2:30 last Monday night.
6240889	eng	I didn't have the nerve to tell the truth.
6240890	eng	I thought Tom would be more cooperative.
6240891	eng	Tom spent the whole day listening to music.
6240892	eng	I didn't have permission to do what I did.
6240893	eng	I thought Tom would be happy to do that.
6240894	eng	Tom spent his thirtieth birthday in a coma.
6240895	eng	I didn't have enough money to take a taxi.
6240896	eng	I thought Tom would be able to help you.
6240897	eng	Tom spent his thirtieth birthday in Boston.
6240898	eng	I didn't have enough money to pay my rent.
6240899	eng	I thought Tom wasn't nervous doing that.
6240900	eng	Tom spent a lot of money on his sports car.
6240901	eng	I didn't have any idea how long I'd slept.
6240902	eng	I thought Tom wasn't doing that anymore.
6240903	eng	Tom slipped while he was crossing the road.
6240904	eng	I didn't go to sleep till late that night.
6240905	eng	I thought Tom was going to be all alone.
6240906	eng	Tom shouldn't have been allowed to do that.
6240907	eng	I didn't drink much at last night's party.
6240908	eng	I thought Tom might not want to do that.
6240909	eng	Tom should've put on more sunscreen.
6240910	eng	I didn't do that because I didn't want to.
6240911	eng	I thought Tom might not need to do that.
6240912	eng	Tom should've done much better than he did.
6240913	eng	I didn't do everything you asked me to do.
6240914	eng	I thought Tom might not have to do that.
6240915	eng	Tom should've been the next one to do that.
6240916	eng	I didn't buy as much as I thought I'd buy.
6240917	eng	I thought Tom looked nervous doing that.
6240918	eng	Tom should've been the last one to do that.
6240919	eng	I couldn't move the heavy trunk by myself.
6240920	eng	I thought Tom knew what we wanted to do.
6240921	eng	Tom should've been forgiven for doing that.
6240922	eng	I couldn't have moved that without help.
6240923	eng	I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
6240924	eng	Tom should've been excused from doing that.
6240925	eng	I couldn't do that because I was too busy.
6240926	eng	I thought Tom knew what the problem was.
6240927	eng	Tom should've been able to do that for you.
6240928	eng	I could get injured if I tried to do that.
6240929	eng	I thought Tom knew what he needed to do.
6240930	eng	Tom should've been able to do that as well.
6240931	eng	I could get injured if I tried doing that.
6240932	eng	I think that Tom won't do that tomorrow.
6240933	eng	Tom should go ahead and do that by himself.
6240934	eng	I can't remember where I buried the money.
6240935	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be pleased by that.
6240936	eng	Tom should consider not doing that anymore.
6240937	eng	I can do that right now if you want me to.
6240938	eng	I think Tom would like to quit his job.
6240939	eng	Tom should be pretty good at French by now.
6240940	eng	I believe I can do that without your help.
6240941	eng	I think Tom would like to do that again.
6240942	eng	Tom should be glad he's not here in Boston.
6240943	eng	I almost never do that when I'm in Boston.
6240944	eng	I think Tom would be willing to do that.
6240945	eng	Tom seriously needs to consider doing that.
6240946	eng	How many years did it take you to do that?
6240947	eng	I think Tom would be tempted to do that.
6240948	eng	Tom seems to be playing games all the time.
6240950	eng	I think Tom would be fascinated by that.
6240951	eng	Tom seems to be aware of what he has to do.
6240952	eng	How many weeks will it take us to do that?
6240953	eng	I think Tom would be afraid of your dog.
6240954	eng	Tom seems to be a little bit unhappy today.
6240955	eng	How many weeks did it take you to do that?
6240956	eng	I think Tom won't be tempted to do that.
6240957	eng	Tom seems convinced that he has to do that.
6240959	eng	I think Tom won't be nervous doing that.
6240960	eng	Tom seemed to know all about what happened.
6240961	eng	How many trees did you cut down yesterday?
6240962	eng	I think Tom won't be frightened by that.
6240963	eng	Tom seemed to be very concerned about that.
6240964	eng	How many times a year do you go to Boston?
6240965	eng	I think Tom will probably do that later.
6240966	eng	Tom says that the noise doesn't bother him.
6240967	eng	How many times a week do you study French?
6240968	eng	I think Tom will be in Boston next week.
6240969	eng	Tom says he thinks he can probably do that.
6240970	eng	How many pairs of white socks do you have?
6240971	eng	I think Tom will be hesitant to do that.
6240972	eng	Tom says he really likes his new job a lot.
6240973	eng	How many months have you spent doing that?
6240974	eng	I think Tom might want to do that today.
6240975	eng	Tom says he plans to vote for the proposal.
6240976	eng	How many minutes have you been doing that?
6240977	eng	I think Tom is the only vegetarian here.
6240978	eng	Tom says he isn't interested in doing that.
6240979	eng	How many hours will it take us to do that?
6240980	eng	I think Tom is interested in doing that.
6240981	eng	Tom says he has no intention of doing that.
6240982	eng	How many hours did it take you to do that?
6240983	eng	I think Tom is in his office on Mondays.
6240984	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to see that movie.
6240986	eng	I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
6240987	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to live in Boston.
6240988	eng	How many days will it take you to do that?
6240989	eng	I think Tom could've refused to do that.
6240990	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he could do that.
6240991	eng	How many chapters did you read last night?
6240992	eng	I think Tom could tell you who did that.
6240993	eng	Tom says he doesn't think I should do that.
6240994	eng	How many bags of marshmallows did you buy?
6240995	eng	I think Tom could go to Boston with you.
6240996	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know what to do.
6240997	eng	How long will it take us to get to Boston?
6240998	eng	I think Tom could end up being arrested.
6240999	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what he should do.
6241000	eng	How did you know what else I needed to do?
6241001	eng	I think Tom could easily have done that.
6241002	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what he has to do.
6241003	eng	How did you know I wanted to be in Boston?
6241004	eng	I think Mr. Jackson's first name is Tom.
6241005	eng	Tom says he doesn't have to do that either.
6241006	eng	Have you ever been absent from this class?
6241007	eng	I think I already know why Tom did that.
6241008	eng	Tom says he definitely won't do that today.
6241009	eng	Even I can do something as simple as that.
6241010	eng	I still sometimes speak French with Tom.
6241011	eng	Tom says he definitely won't do that again.
6241012	eng	Doing that would be the wrong thing to do.
6241013	eng	I still haven't told Tom how to do that.
6241014	eng	Tom says a solution needs to be found soon.
6241015	eng	Doing that will take at least three hours.
6241016	eng	I should've told Tom that I was married.
6241017	eng	Tom sat down and pulled out his smartphone.
6241018	eng	Doing that seems like a stupid idea to me.
6241019	eng	I should've told Tom about that earlier.
6241020	eng	Tom said trying to do that was frustrating.
6241021	eng	Doing that likely won't be so interesting.
6241022	eng	I should've sung the song Tom requested.
6241023	eng	Tom said three of those boys would help us.
6241024	eng	Do you think you would be able to do that?
6241025	eng	I should've given Tom what he asked for.
6241026	eng	Tom said there's nothing he can do to help.
6241027	eng	Do you think you can do that without help?
6241028	eng	I should've done what Tom told me to do.
6241029	eng	Tom said there wasn't anything he could do.
6241030	eng	Do you think they'll permit us to do that?
6241031	eng	I should've asked Tom to do that for me.
6241032	eng	Tom said the pain started three months ago.
6241033	eng	Do you really want to do that by yourself?
6241034	eng	I should've asked Tom before I did that.
6241035	eng	Tom said the heat didn't bother him at all.
6241036	eng	Do you really think it's wrong to do that?
6241037	eng	I should tell Tom what needs to be done.
6241038	eng	Tom said the game seemed to last for hours.
6241039	eng	Do you really think it's smart to do that?
6241040	eng	I should tell Tom what I want him to do.
6241041	eng	Tom said the decision was made by his boss.
6241042	eng	Do you really think it's silly to do that?
6241043	eng	I should tell Tom I won't do that again.
6241044	eng	Tom said the cold didn't bother him at all.
6241045	eng	Do you really think it's risky to do that?
6241046	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'll do that.
6241047	eng	Tom said that's not likely to happen again.
6241048	eng	Do you know what this is called in French?
6241049	eng	I should just tell Tom I made a mistake.
6241050	eng	Tom said that wasn't who we thought it was.
6241051	eng	Do you know what happened in Boston today?
6241052	eng	I said almost the same thing as Tom did.
6241053	eng	Tom said that he's been wanting to do that.
6241054	eng	Do you know how much a kilo of rice costs?
6241055	eng	I really don't think Tom has to do that.
6241056	eng	Tom said that he's been very busy all week.
6241057	eng	Do you ever stay out until after midnight?
6241058	eng	I really don't think Tom had to do that.
6241059	eng	Tom said that he wasn't doing that anymore.
6241060	eng	Do you ever do that when you're in Boston?
6241061	eng	I often help Tom, but he never helps me.
6241062	eng	Tom said that he wanted to see the manager.
6241063	eng	Do you believe there's life after death?
6241064	eng	I never thought Tom would do that again.
6241065	eng	Tom said that he needed to see the manager.
6241066	eng	Didn't you know there was a meeting today?
6241067	eng	I never thought I'd see Tom smile again.
6241068	eng	Tom said many people have been complaining.
6241069	eng	Didn't I tell you that you had to do that?
6241070	eng	I never thought I'd see Tom happy again.
6241071	eng	Tom said it's been fun hanging out with us.
6241072	eng	Didn't I tell you not to worry about that?
6241073	eng	I love Tom and I think he loves me, too.
6241074	eng	Tom said it was his first traffic accident.
6241075	eng	Didn't I tell you I wouldn't go to Boston?
6241076	eng	I let Tom know I didn't know what to do.
6241077	eng	Tom said it should've been easy to do that.
6241078	eng	Did you want to do that with me yesterday?
6241079	eng	I let Tom go to Boston with his friends.
6241080	eng	Tom said his schedule will probably change.
6241081	eng	Did you know you could get there by train?
6241082	eng	I know why Tom shouldn't have done that.
6241083	eng	Tom said he's tried doing that three times.
6241084	eng	Did you know this building had a basement?
6241085	eng	I know where Tom learned how to do that.
6241086	eng	Tom said he's really glad he could do that.
6241087	eng	Could you show me a better way to do that?
6241088	eng	I know that Tom isn't likely to do that.
6241089	eng	Tom said he's glad he was asked to do that.
6241090	eng	Both of my parents were born in Australia.
6241091	eng	I know that Tom isn't afraid to do that.
6241092	eng	Tom said he's determined to do that for us.
6241093	eng	Both of Mary's ex-husbands live in Boston.
6241094	eng	I know that Tom is reluctant to do that.
6241095	eng	Tom said he's been forgiven for doing that.
6241096	eng	Are you planning to return to Boston soon?
6241097	eng	I know that Tom has finished doing that.
6241098	eng	Tom said he's been asked not do that again.
6241099	eng	Are you going to do that even if it rains?
6241100	eng	I know that Tom doesn't want to do that.
6241101	eng	Tom said he'll do that in a couple of days.
6241102	eng	Are there any department stores near here?
6241103	eng	I know that Tom doesn't need to do that.
6241104	eng	Tom said he'll be the first one to do that.
6241105	eng	Are both of your grandfathers still alive?
6241106	eng	I know that Tom doesn't have to do that.
6241107	eng	Tom said he'd definitely do that this week.
6241108	eng	Am I the only one who was able to do that?
6241109	eng	I know Tom won't go to Boston next week.
6241110	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to do that for us.
6241111	eng	About how many hours a day do you do that?
6241112	eng	I know Tom can't speak French very well.
6241113	eng	Tom said he'd be in his office all morning.
6241114	eng	A majority of the people here can do that.
6241115	eng	I knew Tom would likely want to do that.
6241116	eng	Tom said he wouldn't want to do that again.
6241117	eng	"Did you do that yesterday?" "Yes, I did."
6241118	eng	I knew Tom would likely have to do that.
6241119	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be willing to do that.
6241120	eng	Your name doesn't seem to be on the list.
6241121	eng	I knew Tom might be required to do that.
6241122	eng	Tom said he would be able to do that today.
6241123	eng	Your advice has always been very helpful.
6241124	eng	I hope that Tom will be able to do that.
6241125	eng	Tom said he wished you knew how to do that.
6241126	eng	You're too scared to do that, aren't you?
6241127	eng	I hope Tom will come to Boston with you.
6241128	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't eaten so much.
6241129	eng	You're the ugliest person I've ever seen.
6241130	eng	I hope Tom knows who's going to do that.
6241131	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't drunk so much.
6241132	eng	You're the smartest student in our class.
6241133	eng	I hope Tom knows when he has to do that.
6241134	eng	Tom said he wasn't likely to do that today.
6241135	eng	You're the person we've been looking for.
6241136	eng	I hope Tom is willing to do that for me.
6241137	eng	Tom said he wasn't good at speaking French.
6241138	eng	You're the only one who wants to do that.
6241139	eng	I hope Tom is coming to Boston with you.
6241140	eng	Tom said he was willing to wait until 2:30.
6241141	eng	You're the only one who needs to do that.
6241142	eng	I hope Tom is amused by what's going on.
6241143	eng	Tom said he was willing to help us do that.
6241144	eng	You're the only one who knows what to do.
6241145	eng	I hope Tom doesn't insist on doing that.
6241146	eng	Tom said he was too tired to help us today.
6241147	eng	You're still able to do that, aren't you?
6241148	eng	I hope I don't die the same way Tom did.
6241149	eng	Tom said he was told to do that by himself.
6241150	eng	You're one of the smartest people I know.
6241151	eng	I heard that Tom won't do that tomorrow.
6241152	eng	Tom said he was going to do that yesterday.
6241153	eng	You're not the only one who has a camera.
6241154	eng	I heard that Tom got injured doing that.
6241155	eng	Tom said he was enjoying himself in Boston.
6241156	eng	You're not going to do that now, are you?
6241157	eng	I heard Tom is going to quit doing that.
6241158	eng	Tom said he was asked not to do that again.
6241159	eng	You're not allowed to take pictures here.
6241160	eng	I haven't yet asked Tom for his opinion.
6241161	eng	Tom said he wanted to learn how to do that.
6241162	eng	You're not a very good salesman, are you?
6241163	eng	I haven't seen Tom for over three years.
6241164	eng	Tom said he thought that would happen soon.
6241165	eng	You're capable of doing that, aren't you?
6241166	eng	I happened to be on the same bus as Tom.
6241167	eng	Tom said he thought it would rain tomorrow.
6241168	eng	You're being made to do that, aren't you?
6241169	eng	I guess Tom will have to do that for us.
6241170	eng	Tom said he thought it would probably snow.
6241171	eng	You're a construction worker, aren't you?
6241172	eng	I expect you to do the same thing Tom does.
6241173	eng	Tom said he thought he knew how to do that.
6241174	eng	You'll get a chance to do that, I'm sure.
6241175	eng	I expect that Tom will do that tomorrow.
6241176	eng	Tom said he thought he could do that today.
6241177	eng	You'll do that in the morning, won't you?
6241178	eng	I expect Tom will do that at about 2:30.
6241179	eng	Tom said he thought doing that would be OK.
6241180	eng	You'll do that again tomorrow, won't you?
6241181	eng	I doubt very much that Tom will do that.
6241182	eng	Tom said he thought I should buy a new car.
6241183	eng	You'll be able to do that today, I think.
6241184	eng	I doubt that Tom will be home on Monday.
6241185	eng	Tom said he thinks there's no life on Mars.
6241186	eng	You'd never ask me to do that, would you?
6241187	eng	I doubt that Tom has actually done that.
6241188	eng	Tom said he never wanted to be a policeman.
6241189	eng	You'd look pretty stupid if you did that.
6241190	eng	I don't want you to tell Tom about that.
6241191	eng	Tom said he never had to worry about money.
6241192	eng	You'd better do that while you still can.
6241193	eng	I don't want to show Tom how to do that.
6241194	eng	Tom said he needed to learn how to do that.
6241195	eng	You wouldn't actually do that, would you?
6241196	eng	I don't want to share my lunch with Tom.
6241197	eng	Tom said he might not study French anymore.
6241198	eng	You won't do that anytime soon, will you?
6241199	eng	I don't want Tom to know what I've done.
6241200	eng	Tom said he isn't going to help us do that.
6241201	eng	You won't be given the chance to do that.
6241202	eng	I don't want Tom to babysit my children.
6241203	eng	Tom said he hopes to continue working here.
6241204	eng	You won't be allowed to do that tomorrow.
6241205	eng	I don't think Tom will ever get married.
6241206	eng	Tom said he had his reasons for doing that.
6241207	eng	You won't be allowed to do that anywhere.
6241208	eng	I don't think Tom will enjoy doing that.
6241209	eng	Tom said he got really tired of doing that.
6241210	eng	You won't be able to do that on your own.
6241211	eng	I don't think Tom will do that tomorrow.
6241212	eng	Tom said he doesn't usually lock his house.
6241213	eng	You won't be able to do that by yourself.
6241214	eng	I don't think Tom will actually do that.
6241215	eng	Tom said he doesn't mind doing that at all.
6241216	eng	You weren't at home last night, were you?
6241217	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that here.
6241218	eng	Tom said he doesn't live in Boston anymore.
6241219	eng	You were supposed to do that by yourself.
6241220	eng	I don't think Tom really has to do that.
6241221	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help us do that.
6241222	eng	You were skinny the first time I met you.
6241223	eng	I don't think Tom really had to do that.
6241224	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that with us.
6241225	eng	You used to enjoy doing that, didn't you?
6241226	eng	I don't think Tom is through doing that.
6241227	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that anymore.
6241228	eng	You used to be a park ranger, didn't you?
6241229	eng	I don't think Tom is being very helpful.
6241231	eng	You thought I should do that, didn't you?
6241232	eng	I don't think Tom is allowed to do that.
6241233	eng	Tom said he didn't think that would happen.
6241234	eng	You thought I had to do that, didn't you?
6241235	eng	I don't think Tom can understand French.
6241236	eng	Tom said he didn't sleep much Monday night.
6241237	eng	You think that we can do that, don't you?
6241238	eng	I don't really think Tom has to do that.
6241239	eng	Tom said he didn't sleep a wink last night.
6241240	eng	You think I wanted to do that, don't you?
6241241	eng	I don't really think Tom had to do that.
6241242	eng	Tom said he didn't need to do that anymore.
6241243	eng	You think I shouldn't do that, don't you?
6241244	eng	I don't need to worry about Tom anymore.
6241245	eng	Tom said he didn't know who he could trust.
6241246	eng	You think I needed to do that, don't you?
6241247	eng	I don't need to tell Tom how to do that.
6241248	eng	Tom said he didn't intend to pay that bill.
6241249	eng	You're the one who suggested that we do that right away.
6241250	eng	I don't need to know where Tom is going.
6241251	eng	Tom said he didn't have to do that anymore.
6241252	eng	You suggested that I not do that anymore.
6241253	eng	I don't need to do that. Tom will do it.
6241254	eng	Tom said he didn't have any fun doing that.
6241255	eng	You still do that quite often, don't you?
6241256	eng	I don't love Tom as much as he loves me.
6241257	eng	Tom said he didn't have a driver's license.
6241258	eng	You should've told your parents about it.
6241259	eng	I don't like the way Tom treats his dog.
6241260	eng	Tom said he could probably help us do that.
6241261	eng	You should be finished doing that by now.
6241262	eng	I don't know why Tom wasn't at my party.
6241263	eng	Tom said he could do that without any help.
6241264	eng	You should be able to do that if you try.
6241265	eng	I don't know why Tom wanted me to leave.
6241266	eng	Tom said doing that shouldn't be a problem.
6241267	eng	You seem to be very full of energy today.
6241268	eng	I don't know why Tom refused to do that.
6241269	eng	Tom said I looked like a basketball player.
6241270	eng	You ride your bicycle to work, don't you?
6241271	eng	I don't know why Tom is in the hospital.
6241272	eng	Tom said I didn't sound entirely convinced.
6241273	eng	You often do that by yourself, don't you?
6241274	eng	I don't know whether Tom is safe or not.
6241275	eng	Tom regrets that he wasn't able to do that.
6241276	eng	You never do that in the morning, do you?
6241277	eng	I don't know where Tom will be tomorrow.
6241278	eng	Tom refused to tell me what I needed to do.
6241279	eng	You might need to go to Boston next week.
6241280	eng	I don't know where Tom wants to do that.
6241281	eng	Tom really wanted to go to Boston with you.
6241282	eng	You might have to go to Boston next week.
6241283	eng	I don't know when Tom will visit Boston.
6241284	eng	Tom pulled out his key and opened the door.
6241285	eng	You might get hurt if you tried doing that.
6241286	eng	I don't know when Tom will leave Boston.
6241287	eng	Tom published a book in 2013 about dieting.
6241288	eng	You may have as many cookies as you want.
6241289	eng	I don't know when Tom plans to get here.
6241290	eng	Tom promised that he'd come, but he didn't.
6241291	eng	You may do that right now if you want to.
6241292	eng	I don't know what kind of person Tom is.
6241293	eng	Tom promised me he'd help me clean my room.
6241294	eng	You know why I had to do that, don't you?
6241295	eng	I don't know what Tom's intentions were.
6241296	eng	Tom probably won't need to do that anymore.
6241297	eng	You know why I didn't do that, don't you?
6241298	eng	I don't know what Tom is supposed to do.
6241299	eng	Tom probably won't have to do that anymore.
6241300	eng	You know that I won't do that, don't you?
6241301	eng	I don't know what Tom does for a living.
6241302	eng	Tom probably won't be charged with perjury.
6241303	eng	You knew I shouldn't do that, didn't you?
6241304	eng	I don't know how well Tom speaks French.
6241305	eng	Tom probably won't be back by October 20th.
6241306	eng	You knew I needed to do that, didn't you?
6241307	eng	I don't have to worry about Tom anymore.
6241308	eng	Tom probably isn't in the hospital anymore.
6241309	eng	You hope I'm going to do that, don't you?
6241310	eng	I don't have to tell Tom how to do that.
6241311	eng	Tom probably doesn't want to do that again.
6241312	eng	You haven't stopped doing that, have you?
6241313	eng	I don't have to do that. Tom will do it.
6241314	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why you did that.
6241315	eng	You haven't forgotten anything, have you?
6241316	eng	I don't have time to help Tom right now.
6241317	eng	Tom probably doesn't know much about birds.
6241318	eng	You haven't done that recently, have you?
6241319	eng	I don't have as many stamps as Tom does.
6241320	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how to play jazz.
6241321	eng	You haven't done that in years, have you?
6241322	eng	I don't eat meat and Tom doesn't either.
6241323	eng	Tom probably couldn't do that without help.
6241324	eng	You have to do that before it's too late.
6241325	eng	I don't care what happens, but Tom does.
6241326	eng	Tom plays both the saxophone and the flute.
6241327	eng	You get very talkative when you're drunk.
6241328	eng	I don't believe Tom. I think he's lying.
6241329	eng	Tom plans to start working here in October.
6241330	eng	You get paid a lot to do that, don't you?
6241331	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom how old I was.
6241332	eng	Tom picked me up on his way home from work.
6241333	eng	You don't want us to do that now, do you?
6241334	eng	I didn't want to invite Tom to my party.
6241335	eng	Tom must've known this was going to happen.
6241336	eng	You don't want to do that either, do you?
6241337	eng	I didn't want to help Tom do that today.
6241338	eng	Tom must've been amused by what's going on.
6241339	eng	You don't think we could do that, do you?
6241340	eng	I didn't want to help Tom do that again.
6241341	eng	Tom may want to go to Boston for Christmas.
6241342	eng	You don't think I should do that, do you?
6241343	eng	I didn't want to go, but Tom made me go.
6241344	eng	Tom may not want to do that, but he has to.
6241345	eng	You don't really want to do that, do you?
6241346	eng	I didn't want to be seen talking to Tom.
6241347	eng	Tom may not be willing to buy that for you.
6241348	eng	You don't really need to do that, do you?
6241349	eng	I didn't want anyone to see me with Tom.
6241350	eng	Tom may have as much ice cream as he wants.
6241351	eng	You don't really like doing that, do you?
6241352	eng	I didn't want Tom to think I was a wimp.
6241353	eng	Tom made up his mind to do that by himself.
6241354	eng	You don't really have to do that, do you?
6241355	eng	I didn't want Tom to think I was a jerk.
6241356	eng	Tom looked everywhere except in the closet.
6241357	eng	You don't need to make that decision now.
6241358	eng	I didn't think that would embarrass Tom.
6241359	eng	Tom knows he's not supposed to eat peanuts.
6241360	eng	You don't need our permission to do that.
6241361	eng	I didn't think that Tom knew what to do.
6241362	eng	Tom joined our band as the drummer in 2013.
6241363	eng	You don't like the way I do that, do you?
6241364	eng	I didn't think Tom's idea was very good.
6241365	eng	Tom isn't old enough to know the truth yet.
6241366	eng	You don't like it when I do that, do you?
6241367	eng	I didn't think Tom would really do that.
6241368	eng	Tom isn't likely to go to camp this summer.
6241369	eng	You don't have to tell me how to do that.
6241370	eng	I didn't think Tom would let me do that.
6241371	eng	Tom isn't likely to be there for very long.
6241372	eng	You don't have our permission to do that.
6241373	eng	I didn't think Tom would catch any fish.
6241374	eng	Tom isn't likely to be called as a witness.
6241375	eng	You don't do that as often as you should.
6241376	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so careless.
6241377	eng	Tom isn't likely to be home on Monday.
6241378	eng	You didn't look like you were interested.
6241379	eng	I didn't think Tom would be embarrassed.
6241380	eng	Tom is way too young to do that by himself.
6241381	eng	You didn't look like you were frightened.
6241382	eng	I didn't think Tom would be disobedient.
6241383	eng	Tom is very likely to pass the examination.
6241384	eng	You didn't have time to do that, did you?
6241385	eng	I didn't think Tom would be discouraged.
6241386	eng	Tom is trying to figure that out right now.
6241387	eng	You didn't even apologize for doing that.
6241388	eng	I didn't think Tom would be cooperative.
6241389	eng	Tom is the only person here that I trust.
6241390	eng	You didn't do that very quickly, did you?
6241391	eng	I didn't think Tom was ready to do that.
6241392	eng	Tom is the only one who enjoyed doing that.
6241393	eng	You didn't do that deliberately, did you?
6241394	eng	I didn't tell Tom who my girlfriend was.
6241395	eng	Tom is the only one who doesn't look happy.
6241396	eng	You did that for a long time, didn't you?
6241397	eng	I didn't tell Tom what my last name was.
6241398	eng	Tom is the only one here who can't do that.
6241399	eng	You did that for a few years, didn't you?
6241400	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he needed to buy.
6241401	eng	Tom is the last person I want to see today.
6241402	eng	You could do that today if you wanted to.
6241403	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I couldn't eat.
6241404	eng	Tom is supposed to be doing that right now.
6241405	eng	You could do that again if you wanted to.
6241406	eng	I didn't tell Tom the reason I was late.
6241407	eng	Tom is rich enough to do anything he wants.
6241408	eng	You can do that wherever you want, right?
6241409	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I had to do that.
6241410	eng	Tom is rich enough to buy any car he wants.
6241411	eng	You can do that right now if you want to.
6241412	eng	I didn't tell Tom I was already married.
6241413	eng	Tom is one of the best players on our team.
6241414	eng	You aren't permitted to do that anywhere.
6241415	eng	I didn't send Tom any letters last year.
6241416	eng	Tom is much more dangerous than we thought.
6241417	eng	Will you please pass the salt and pepper?
6241418	eng	I didn't really think Tom would do that.
6241419	eng	Tom is likely to figure out how to do that.
6241420	eng	Why don't you try doing that by yourself?
6241421	eng	I didn't really think Tom could do that.
6241422	eng	Tom is likely to be immune to that disease.
6241424	eng	I didn't pay attention to what Tom said.
6241425	eng	Tom is likely not to be willing to do that.
6241426	eng	Why do you think Mary is an unusual girl?
6241427	eng	I didn't let Tom get away with anything.
6241428	eng	Tom is having a nice time with his friends.
6241429	eng	Why do we permit our students to do that?
6241430	eng	I didn't know why Tom wanted to do that.
6241431	eng	Tom is happily married with three children.
6241432	eng	Why didn't you want to do that yesterday?
6241433	eng	I didn't know why Tom needed to do that.
6241434	eng	Tom is going to be very successful someday.
6241435	eng	Why aren't you going to the office today?
6241436	eng	I didn't know who Tom was going to meet.
6241437	eng	Tom is due to be sentenced on October 20th.
6241438	eng	Where will you be during summer vacation?
6241439	eng	I didn't know where Tom was going to go.
6241440	eng	Tom is due to be arraigned on October 20th.
6241441	eng	Where do you want to spend your vacation?
6241442	eng	I didn't know where Tom wanted me to go.
6241443	eng	Tom is always at least thirty minutes late.
6241444	eng	When did you start trying to lose weight?
6241445	eng	I didn't know what Tom was trying to do.
6241446	eng	Tom is actually a very good French speaker.
6241447	eng	Whatever you do, don't forget to do that.
6241448	eng	I didn't know what Tom was going to say.
6241449	eng	Tom is about to run out of his medications.
6241450	eng	What's the last thing you remember doing?
6241451	eng	I didn't know what Tom wanted me to say.
6241452	eng	Tom is a lawyer like his father used to be.
6241453	eng	What would you like to do this afternoon?
6241454	eng	I didn't know what Tom wanted me to buy.
6241455	eng	Tom is a good cook, but I think I'm better.
6241456	eng	What website do you visit the most often?
6241457	eng	I didn't know that Tom was in Australia.
6241458	eng	Tom hoped to get a chance to do that again.
6241459	eng	What kind of response were you expecting?
6241460	eng	I didn't know that Tom had so many cats.
6241461	eng	Tom hasn't told me why he wants to do that.
6241462	eng	What kind of clothes do you usually wear?
6241463	eng	I didn't know if Tom could do it or not.
6241464	eng	Tom hasn't told me why he needs to do that.
6241465	eng	What do you like to do with your friends?
6241466	eng	I didn't know Tom would have to do that.
6241467	eng	Tom hasn't realized that he's made a mistake.
6241468	eng	What are some countries you have visited?
6241469	eng	I didn't know Tom would do that so well.
6241470	eng	Tom has trouble remembering people's names.
6241471	eng	We've decided to go to Boston in October.
6241472	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to be fired.
6241473	eng	Tom has three times as many stamps as I do.
6241474	eng	We're fortunate that we can do that here.
6241475	eng	I didn't know Tom had already done that.
6241476	eng	Tom has started working as a house painter.
6241477	eng	We'd be lucky if we were able to do that.
6241478	eng	I didn't know I had to help Tom do that.
6241479	eng	Tom has started looking for work in Boston.
6241480	eng	We won't be going to Boston anytime soon.
6241481	eng	I didn't expect to see Tom at the party.
6241482	eng	Tom has seen that happen many times before.
6241483	eng	We should go to Boston together sometime.
6241484	eng	I didn't ask Tom which one he preferred.
6241485	eng	Tom has promised to never to do that again.
6241486	eng	We should go to Boston as soon as we can.
6241487	eng	I did that the way Tom told me to do it.
6241488	eng	Tom has never met any of his grandchildren.
6241489	eng	We might need to go to Boston next month.
6241490	eng	I did everything the way Tom told me to.
6241491	eng	Tom has managed to do what he needed to do.
6241492	eng	We might live in Boston for another year.
6241493	eng	I did almost the same thing as Tom did.
6241494	eng	Tom has lost a lot of weight since October.
6241495	eng	We just lived in Boston for a short time.
6241496	eng	I decorated the Christmas tree with Tom.
6241497	eng	Tom has lived in Boston for his whole life.
6241498	eng	We have a meeting this afternoon at 2:30.
6241499	eng	I can't remember what Tom told me to do.
6241500	eng	Tom has likely already forgotten your name.
6241501	eng	We got a lot of criticism for doing that.
6241503	eng	Tom has finally figured out how to do that.
6241504	eng	We don't usually get this much snow here.
6241505	eng	I can't believe you called Tom a coward.
6241506	eng	Tom has done that for the last three years.
6241507	eng	Very few people actually do that anymore.
6241508	eng	I can't believe Tom did that by himself.
6241509	eng	Tom has done everything we asked him to do.
6241510	eng	Tomorrow would be a good time to do that.
6241511	eng	How many years has Tom spent doing that?
6241512	eng	Tom has done a lot of really stupid things.
6241513	eng	This is the second time you've done that.
6241514	eng	How many weeks has Tom spent doing that?
6241515	eng	Tom has definitely gotten better at French.
6241516	eng	They've already hired everyone they need.
6241517	eng	How many times an hour does Tom do that?
6241518	eng	Tom has decided to do that a different way.
6241519	eng	There's only one more thing I have to do.
6241520	eng	How many times a night does Tom do that?
6241521	eng	Tom has decided not to continue doing that.
6241522	eng	There's just one more thing I have to do.
6241523	eng	How many times a month does Tom do that?
6241524	eng	Tom has decided he doesn't want to do that.
6241525	eng	There was nothing we could do about that.
6241526	eng	How many months has Tom been doing that?
6241527	eng	Tom has come to all of my birthday parties.
6241528	eng	The police said there were no casualties.
6241529	eng	How many hours has Tom spent doing that?
6241530	eng	Tom has been told that he needs to do that.
6241531	eng	The librarian said we needed to be quiet.
6241532	eng	How long did you and Tom stay in Boston?
6241533	eng	Tom has been told he needs to wear goggles.
6241534	eng	That's the only thing I want to do today.
6241535	eng	How did you know Tom would be in Boston?
6241536	eng	Tom has been living in Boston way too long.
6241537	eng	That's the best idea I've heard all week.
6241538	eng	How did you get Tom to buy that for you?
6241539	eng	Tom has been in a coma for thirty days now.
6241540	eng	That's a very inefficient way to do that.
6241541	eng	Don't forget to tell Tom not to do that.
6241542	eng	Tom has been in Boston for three years now.
6241543	eng	That'll likely happen sometime next week.
6241544	eng	Do you think Tom will permit me do that?
6241545	eng	Tom has been here for at least three years.
6241546	eng	That was my first time to eat horse meat.
6241547	eng	Do you think Tom might be too confident?
6241548	eng	Tom has been having a hard time doing that.
6241549	eng	Perhaps you don't really need to do that.
6241550	eng	Do you think Tom is finished doing that?
6241551	eng	Tom has been doing that since he was a kid.
6241552	eng	Perhaps you don't really have to do that.
6241553	eng	Do you think I could get Tom to do that?
6241554	eng	Tom has already said that he won't do that.
6241555	eng	People around here don't usually do that.
6241556	eng	Do you mean you didn't do that with Tom?
6241557	eng	Tom has advised me not to start doing that.
6241558	eng	Our team is the worst team in the league.
6241559	eng	Do you know whether Tom did that or not?
6241560	eng	Tom has a girlfriend who's very possessive.
6241561	eng	Next time I'll have to do that by myself.
6241562	eng	Do you know the reason why Tom was late?
6241563	eng	Tom has a degree in mechanical engineering.
6241564	eng	My parents wouldn't permit me to do that.
6241565	eng	Do you have any idea what Tom has to do?
6241566	eng	Tom happened to have the day off yesterday.
6241567	eng	My house is the third house on the right.
6241568	eng	Didn't you know that Tom would be there?
6241570	eng	Most people here don't understand French.
6241571	eng	Didn't you know that Tom isn't Canadian?
6241572	eng	Tom got nervous when he saw the police car.
6241573	eng	Most people here don't know how to drive.
6241574	eng	Didn't you know that Tom is from Boston?
6241575	eng	Tom goes out drinking almost every evening.
6241576	eng	Mary may be pretty, but I don't like her.
6241577	eng	Didn't you know that Tom has lots cats?
6241578	eng	Tom gets along well with his father-in-law.
6241579	eng	It's stuffy in here. May I open a window?
6241580	eng	Didn't you know Tom was writing a novel?
6241581	eng	Tom gave me a nice umbrella, but I lost it.
6241582	eng	It's hot in here. May I open the windows?
6241583	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still in prison?
6241584	eng	Tom gave each of his children three apples.
6241585	eng	It's absolutely necessary that I do that.
6241586	eng	Didn't you know Tom liked to go fishing?
6241587	eng	Tom gave all his books to the city library.
6241588	eng	It'll probably be interesting to do that.
6241589	eng	Didn't you know Tom liked horror movies?
6241590	eng	Tom first came to visit us three years ago.
6241591	eng	It'll be more fun if we do that together.
6241592	eng	Didn't you know Tom knew how to do that?
6241593	eng	Tom fell in love with a woman half his age.
6241594	eng	It would be unfortunate if that happened.
6241595	eng	Didn't you know Tom is good at juggling?
6241596	eng	Tom faces life in prison if he's convicted.
6241597	eng	It would be risky to do that by yourself.
6241598	eng	Didn't you know Tom had a swimming pool?
6241599	eng	Tom even worked as a taxi driver in Boston.
6241600	eng	It would be interesting to do that again.
6241601	eng	Didn't you know Tom couldn't do that?
6241602	eng	Tom doesn't want you to ever do that again.
6241603	eng	It would be impossible for me to do that.
6241604	eng	Didn't you know Tom could play the tuba?
6241605	eng	Tom doesn't think you should be doing that.
6241606	eng	It would be great if you did that for me.
6241607	eng	Didn't Tom tell you he wouldn't do that?
6241608	eng	Tom doesn't think we need to do that today.
6241609	eng	It would be almost impossible to do that.
6241610	eng	Did you know that Tom wanted to do that?
6241611	eng	Tom doesn't think we have to do that today.
6241612	eng	It was easier to do that than I expected.
6241613	eng	Did you know Tom used to work in Boston?
6241614	eng	Tom doesn't think that I did that, does he?
6241615	eng	It took three years to build this bridge.
6241616	eng	Did you know Tom is actually very smart?
6241617	eng	Tom doesn't think he really has to do that.
6241618	eng	It should be possible for you to do that.
6241619	eng	Did you know Tom didn't want to do that?
6241620	eng	Tom doesn't think he can do that that soon.
6241621	eng	It probably won't be possible to do that.
6241622	eng	Did you know Tom didn't need to do that?
6241623	eng	Tom doesn't think I'm permitted to do that.
6241624	eng	Is there anything else you'd like to say?
6241625	eng	Did you know Tom didn't like to do that?
6241626	eng	Tom doesn't think I really need to do that.
6241627	eng	If you want me to, I'll buy that for you.
6241628	eng	Did you know Tom didn't like doing that?
6241629	eng	Tom doesn't think I really have to do that.
6241630	eng	If you hate doing that, then don't do it.
6241631	eng	Did you know Tom didn't have to do that?
6241632	eng	Tom doesn't still want to do that, does he?
6241633	eng	If you do that for me, I'd appreciate it.
6241634	eng	Did you know Tom and John were brothers?
6241635	eng	Tom doesn't still need to do that, does he?
6241636	eng	If we had enough money, we could do that.
6241637	eng	Both Tom and his passenger were injured.
6241638	eng	Tom doesn't still have to do that, does he?
6241639	eng	If we had done that, we would've had fun.
6241640	eng	Ask Tom if he wants to do that with you.
6241641	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what he should do.
6241642	eng	I've been listening to the radio all day.
6241643	eng	Ask Tom if he really has to do that now.
6241644	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what he has to do.
6241645	eng	I've always wanted to be able to do that.
6241646	eng	As Tom was doing that, it began to rain.
6241647	eng	Tom doesn't seem amused by what's going on.
6241648	eng	I've already eaten both of my sandwiches.
6241649	eng	Aren't you glad that Tom didn't do that?
6241650	eng	Tom doesn't remember if he did that or not.
6241651	eng	I've already done everything I had to do.
6241653	eng	Tom doesn't remember asking you to do that.
6241654	eng	I'm thinking about applying for that job.
6241655	eng	Are you and Tom still dating each other?
6241656	eng	Tom doesn't permit his children to do that.
6241657	eng	I'm the only person who can help you now.
6241658	eng	"Is Tom afraid?" "No, I don't think so."
6241659	eng	Tom doesn't need our permission to do that.
6241660	eng	I'm sure you'll find some way to do that.
6241661	eng	You'll never let Tom do that, will you?
6241662	eng	Tom doesn't like taking care of the garden.
6241663	eng	I'm not interested in doing that anymore.
6241664	eng	You'd never let Tom do that, would you?
6241665	eng	Tom doesn't like people who aren't on time.
6241666	eng	I'm not going to go to Boston this month.
6241667	eng	You won't let Tom do that, will you?
6241668	eng	Tom doesn't like either baseball or soccer.
6241669	eng	I'm not convinced that I need to do that.
6241670	eng	You think Tom won't do that, don't you?
6241671	eng	Tom doesn't like Boston and I don't either.
6241672	eng	I'm not an easy person to get along with.
6241673	eng	You think Tom could do that, don't you?
6241674	eng	Tom doesn't know what he's doing out there.
6241675	eng	I'm going to stay in Boston until Monday.
6241676	eng	You should've shown Tom how to do that.
6241677	eng	Tom doesn't know this is a tough situation.
6241678	eng	I'm getting a little tired of doing that.
6241679	eng	You should get Tom to help you do that.
6241680	eng	Tom doesn't know that I've never done that.
6241681	eng	I'm feeling too depressed to do anything.
6241682	eng	You should get Tom to buy that for you.
6241683	eng	Tom doesn't know how much money was stolen.
6241684	eng	I'll try to do that the same way you did.
6241685	eng	You should ask Tom to help you do that.
6241686	eng	Tom doesn't know how he's going to do that.
6241687	eng	I'll be on a business trip all next week.
6241688	eng	You should ask Tom to buy that for you.
6241689	eng	Tom doesn't know he's got to do that today.
6241690	eng	I'd be very happy if you did that for me.
6241691	eng	You seemed surprised when Tom did that.
6241692	eng	Tom doesn't know he's going to be punished.
6241693	eng	I'd be very disappointed if you did that.
6241694	eng	You don't believe Tom did that, do you?
6241695	eng	Tom doesn't know he's going to be arrested.
6241696	eng	I'd be in Boston right now if I could be.
6241697	eng	You don't allow Tom to do that, do you?
6241698	eng	Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that here.
6241699	eng	I'd be disappointed if I saw you do that.
6241700	eng	You allowed Tom to do that, didn't you?
6241701	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly what he should do.
6241702	eng	I wouldn't do that anymore if I were you.
6241703	eng	Would you want Tom to buy that for you?
6241704	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly what he has to do.
6241705	eng	I wouldn't be opposed to going to Boston.
6241706	eng	Would Tom be willing to do that for us?
6241707	eng	Tom doesn't have to tell me how to do that.
6241708	eng	I wish I'd been strong enough to do that.
6241709	eng	Why wouldn't you permit Tom to do that?
6241710	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that, but he should.
6241711	eng	I wish I hadn't left my windows unlocked.
6241712	eng	Why don't you let Tom buy that for you?
6241713	eng	Tom doesn't have time to do that right now.
6241714	eng	I wish I hadn't had to do that by myself.
6241715	eng	Why do you still permit Tom to do that?
6241716	eng	Tom doesn't have the confidence to do that.
6241717	eng	I wish I hadn't gone to Boston last week.
6241718	eng	Why didn't Tom come to Boston with you?
6241719	eng	Tom doesn't have our permission to do that.
6241720	eng	I wish I could play the saxophone better.
6241721	eng	Who was the class president before Tom?
6241722	eng	Tom doesn't give his children an allowance.
6241723	eng	I wish I could figure out how to do that.
6241724	eng	Who was that who was swimming with Tom?
6241725	eng	Tom doesn't care whether we do that or not.
6241726	eng	I wasted a lot of time trying to do that.
6241727	eng	Who told you Tom would want to do that?
6241728	eng	Tom doesn't believe his son is still alive.
6241729	eng	I wasn't the only one who had to do that.
6241730	eng	Who told you Tom could ride a unicycle?
6241731	eng	Tom does that at 2:30 every day but Monday.
6241732	eng	I wasn't the only one allowed to do that.
6241733	eng	What kind of treatment did Tom receive?
6241734	eng	Tom died two days after he moved to Boston.
6241735	eng	I wasn't the first one to try to do that.
6241736	eng	What did you think Tom was going to do?
6241737	eng	Tom died before he had a chance to do that.
6241738	eng	I wasn't surprised that I had to do that.
6241739	eng	Was it you who told Tom not to do that?
6241740	eng	Tom didn't seem to be doing that very well.
6241741	eng	I wasn't old enough to vote at that time.
6241742	eng	There's no way Tom is going to do that.
6241743	eng	Tom didn't seem aware of what was going on.
6241744	eng	I wasn't in good enough shape to do that.
6241745	eng	There's no way Tom did that on his own.
6241746	eng	Tom didn't say what he had intended to say.
6241747	eng	I wasn't expecting you to do that for me.
6241748	eng	There's no way Tom did that by himself.
6241749	eng	Tom didn't really go to church last Sunday.
6241750	eng	I wasn't convinced that I had to do that.
6241751	eng	There's a chance that Tom will do that.
6241752	eng	Tom didn't really enjoy doing that, did he?
6241753	eng	I wasn't aware that I was being followed.
6241754	eng	The answer Tom gave seemed wrong to me.
6241755	eng	Tom didn't look like he was in a good mood.
6241756	eng	I wasn't able to swim until I was thirty.
6241757	eng	That would be impossible for Tom to do.
6241758	eng	Tom didn't know when he needed to be there.
6241759	eng	I was wondering whether I should do that.
6241760	eng	Tell Tom he has to do that before 2:30.
6241761	eng	Tom didn't know that you wouldn't be there.
6241762	eng	I was told that we don't have to do that.
6241763	eng	Tell Tom I won't go to Boston with him.
6241764	eng	Tom didn't know that what he did was wrong.
6241765	eng	I was the only one who wanted to do that.
6241766	eng	Tell Tom I need to do that before 2:30.
6241767	eng	Tom didn't know that I was able to do that.
6241768	eng	I was the only one who needed to do that.
6241769	eng	Please tell Tom to do that before 2:30.
6241770	eng	Tom didn't know if he could do that or not.
6241771	eng	I was thankful for the chance to do that.
6241772	eng	Please tell Tom that he has to do that.
6241773	eng	Tom didn't know how long he'd have to wait.
6241774	eng	I was hoping we wouldn't have to do that.
6241775	eng	Please tell Tom that I need to do that.
6241776	eng	Tom didn't know he was supposed to do that.
6241777	eng	I wanted to stay in Boston until October.
6241778	eng	Please tell Tom he should do that soon.
6241779	eng	Tom didn't even try to negotiate the price.
6241780	eng	I wanted to help, but I didn't have time.
6241781	eng	My son married Tom's youngest daughter.
6241782	eng	Tom didn't do that for me, but for himself.
6241783	eng	I want you to do that so I don't have to.
6241784	eng	My priorities are different from Tom's.
6241785	eng	Tom didn't attend this afternoon's meeting.
6241786	eng	I want to stay in Boston a little longer.
6241787	eng	My injuries weren't as severe as Tom's.
6241788	eng	Tom did something he wasn't supposed to do.
6241789	eng	I want to learn to speak French fluently.
6241790	eng	Maybe Tom should go to Boston with you.
6241791	eng	Tom did everything he thought he should do.
6241792	eng	I want to learn how to cook Italian food.
6241793	eng	Just make sure you tell Tom to do that.
6241794	eng	Tom did everything he thought he needed to do.
6241795	eng	I want to know when we're going to start.
6241796	eng	It would be surprising if Tom did that.
6241797	eng	Tom did everything he thought he had to do.
6241798	eng	I want to know when we're going to leave.
6241799	eng	It would be great if Tom could do that.
6241800	eng	Tom did everything he felt he needed to do.
6241801	eng	I want to know what you did last weekend.
6241802	eng	It would be foolish for Tom to do that.
6241803	eng	Tom did apologize for doing that years ago.
6241804	eng	I want to know the cause of the accident.
6241805	eng	It was decided that Tom should do that.
6241806	eng	Tom definitely wants to do that by himself.
6241807	eng	I want to go out to get something to eat.
6241808	eng	It looks like Tom has done that before.
6241809	eng	Tom cut the ribbon with a pair of scissors.
6241810	eng	I want to get there before everyone else.
6241811	eng	Is it true that Tom will be doing that?
6241812	eng	Tom couldn't have done something like that.
6241813	eng	I want to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6241814	eng	Is Tom the only one who has to do that?
6241815	eng	Tom couldn't do that without a lot of help.
6241816	eng	I want everyone to remain where they are.
6241817	eng	Is Tom still willing to do that for us?
6241818	eng	Tom could've been the first one to do that.
6241819	eng	I turned out the light and left the room.
6241820	eng	Is Tom still be able to do that for us?
6241821	eng	Tom could've been punished for what he did.
6241822	eng	I tried to do that, but I wasn't able to.
6241823	eng	I've already forgotten Tom's last name.
6241824	eng	Tom could've been arrested for what he did.
6241825	eng	I thought you said you'd quit doing that.
6241826	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be in Boston now.
6241827	eng	Tom could do that if he put his mind to it.
6241828	eng	I thought you said you'd help us do that.
6241829	eng	I'm sure Tom will want to do that, too.
6241830	eng	Tom could be gone by the time we get there.
6241831	eng	I thought you knew how to play the piano.
6241832	eng	I'm sure Tom will pass the examination.
6241833	eng	Tom could always try doing that by himself.
6241834	eng	I thought you didn't know how to do that.
6241835	eng	I'm sure Tom will need to do that, too.
6241836	eng	Tom claimed he wasn't the one who did that.
6241837	eng	I thought I'd have all the time I needed.
6241838	eng	I'm sure Tom will have to do that, too.
6241839	eng	Tom checked three books out of the library.
6241840	eng	I thought I'd be able to do that by 2:30.
6241841	eng	I'm still reluctant to do that for Tom.
6241842	eng	Tom can't have done that without some help.
6241843	eng	I thought I was going to win the contest.
6241844	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom has to do.
6241845	eng	Tom can have as much ice cream as he wants.
6241846	eng	I thought I might be required to do that.
6241847	eng	I'm not going to permit Tom to do that.
6241848	eng	Tom called to say he'd be three hours late.
6241849	eng	I think you're not likely to be punished.
6241850	eng	I'm going to ask Tom to do that for me.
6241851	eng	Tom believes doing that would be a mistake.
6241852	eng	I think we have everything under control.
6241853	eng	I'm going over to Tom's this afternoon.
6241854	eng	Tom began studying French three months ago.
6241855	eng	I think it's way too late to do that now.
6241856	eng	I'm afraid that Tom may have done that.
6241857	eng	Tom assured us that he won't do that again.
6241858	eng	I think it's little too early to do that.
6241859	eng	I'll never forgive Tom for what he did.
6241860	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to go to the zoo.
6241861	eng	I think it would've been good to do that.
6241862	eng	I think Tom should be more patient.
6241863	eng	Tom asked me to throw the ball back to him.
6241864	eng	I think it should be possible to do that.
6241865	eng	I wonder why Tom wasn't here yesterday.
6241866	eng	Tom asked me if he could borrow some money.
6241867	eng	I think it might not be smart to do that.
6241868	eng	I wonder why Tom isn't very happy here.
6241869	eng	Tom asked me if I really wanted to do that.
6241870	eng	I think it might not be cheap to do that.
6241871	eng	I wonder why Tom didn't come yesterday.
6241872	eng	Tom asked me if I really needed to do that.
6241873	eng	I think it might be expensive to do that.
6241874	eng	I wonder if Tom is prepared to do that.
6241875	eng	Tom and three other prisoners have escaped.
6241876	eng	I think it might be dangerous to do that.
6241877	eng	I wish Tom wouldn't do that by himself.
6241878	eng	Tom and I've taken a lot of trips together.
6241879	eng	I think I'll be able to help you do that.
6241880	eng	I wish I hadn't scolded Tom so harshly.
6241881	eng	Tom and I were the first people to do that.
6241882	eng	I think I wouldn't enjoy visiting Boston.
6241883	eng	I went to the same school that Tom did.
6241884	eng	Tom and I wanted to go to a movie together.
6241885	eng	I think I won't go to Boston next spring.
6241886	eng	I wasn't sure what Tom wanted me to do.
6241887	eng	Tom and I wanted to go for a walk together.
6241888	eng	I think I could do that without any help.
6241889	eng	I was hoping Tom could do that with me.
6241890	eng	Tom and I want to know what your plans are.
6241891	eng	I suppose we could go to Boston with you.
6241892	eng	I was at Harvard the same time Tom was.
6241893	eng	Tom and I walked into the theater together.
6241894	eng	I still miss all of my friends in Boston.
6241895	eng	I wanted Tom to show me how to do that.
6241896	eng	Tom and I used to work out at the same gym.
6241897	eng	I still have time to do that before 2:30.
6241898	eng	I want to see if Tom likes my new song.
6241899	eng	Tom and I used to play backgammon together.
6241900	eng	I still have things that need to be done.
6241901	eng	I want to know who Tom's girlfriend is.
6241902	eng	Tom and I used to be married to each other.
6241903	eng	I still don't know why I need to do that.
6241904	eng	I want to know how much beer Tom drank.
6241905	eng	Tom and I talked about this three days ago.
6241906	eng	I spent more money than I had planned to.
6241907	eng	I want to discuss the problem with Tom.
6241908	eng	Tom and I talked about all kinds of things.
6241909	eng	I shouldn't have tried singing that song.
6241910	eng	I used to live in the same dorm as Tom.
6241911	eng	Tom and I still aren't planning to do that.
6241912	eng	I shouldn't have left the party so early.
6241913	eng	I understand that Tom always does that.
6241914	eng	Tom and I started talking at the same time.
6241915	eng	I should've visited Boston, but I didn't.
6241917	eng	Tom and I skied down the mountain together.
6241918	eng	I should've parked my car somewhere else.
6241919	eng	I tried to convince Tom not to do that.
6241920	eng	Tom and I play chess together every Monday.
6241921	eng	I should've known better than to do that.
6241922	eng	I told Tom the same thing you told him.
6241923	eng	Tom and I met to discuss what had happened.
6241924	eng	I should've gone to Boston, but I didn't.
6241925	eng	I told Tom that he should leave Boston.
6241926	eng	Tom and I looked at each other and laughed.
6241927	eng	I should've done that before I went home.
6241928	eng	I told Tom I'd help him clean his room.
6241929	eng	Tom and I headed off in the same direction.
6241930	eng	I should've been the last one to do that.
6241931	eng	I thought you said Tom often does that.
6241932	eng	Tom and I have decided to do that together.
6241933	eng	I should've been here with you yesterday.
6241934	eng	I thought you said Tom does that a lot.
6241935	eng	Tom and I have been best friends for years.
6241936	eng	I should've been able to do that for you.
6241937	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't want to do that.
6241938	eng	Tom and I hardly ever do anything together.
6241939	eng	I sat down next to someone I didn't know.
6241940	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't do that anymore.
6241941	eng	Tom and I had a good time singing together.
6241942	eng	I pretended I didn't know how to do that.
6241943	eng	I thought Tom would do that right away.
6241944	eng	Tom and I got married in Boston in October.
6241945	eng	I need to find another way to make money.
6241946	eng	I thought Tom wasn't drunk, but he was.
6241947	eng	Tom and I go camping together every summer.
6241948	eng	I live in a house just around the corner.
6241949	eng	I thought Tom was reluctant to do that.
6241950	eng	Tom and I don't usually eat the same thing.
6241951	eng	I like your garden and the flowers in it.
6241952	eng	I thought Tom was going to be punished.
6241953	eng	Tom and I don't talk to each other anymore.
6241954	eng	I know what would happen if you did that.
6241955	eng	I thought Tom was going to be arrested.
6241956	eng	Tom and I don't really have much in common.
6241957	eng	I know how difficult it'll be to do that.
6241958	eng	I thought Tom was desperate to do that.
6241959	eng	Tom and I don't like the same kind of food.
6241960	eng	I know I'm supposed to do that by myself.
6241961	eng	I thought Tom should get more exercise.
6241962	eng	Tom and I don't know anything about Boston.
6241963	eng	I know I'm not supposed to do that today.
6241964	eng	I thought Tom liked this kind of music.
6241965	eng	Tom and I decided to go to Boston together.
6241966	eng	I know I might not have to do that again.
6241967	eng	I thought Tom knew what had to be done.
6241968	eng	Tom and I are waiting for you in the lobby.
6241969	eng	I know I might not be allowed to do that.
6241970	eng	I thought Tom knew what I wanted to do.
6241971	eng	Tom and I are more or less the same weight.
6241972	eng	I know I might need to do that on Monday.
6241973	eng	I thought Tom had forgotten to do that.
6241974	eng	Tom and I are longtime residents of Boston.
6241975	eng	I know I might need to do that by myself.
6241976	eng	I thought Tom didn't have a girlfriend.
6241977	eng	Tom's teammates are just as good as he is.
6241978	eng	I know I might have to do that on Monday.
6241979	eng	I thought Tom could lend us some money.
6241980	eng	Tom's spoken French is hard to understand.
6241981	eng	I know I might have to do that by myself.
6241982	eng	I thought Tom could lend me some money.
6241983	eng	Tom's light is on, so he's probably awake.
6241984	eng	I knew I might not have to do that again.
6241985	eng	I think that Tom will do that tomorrow.
6241986	eng	Tom's eyesight has gradually gotten worse.
6241987	eng	I knew I might not be allowed to do that.
6241988	eng	I think Tom wouldn't regret doing that.
6241989	eng	Tom's doctor advised him to exercise more.
6241990	eng	I knew I might need to do that by myself.
6241991	eng	I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
6241992	eng	Tom wouldn't do that if he didn't want to.
6241993	eng	I knew I might have to do that by myself.
6241994	eng	I think Tom would be afraid to do that.
6241995	eng	Tom wouldn't do that if he didn't need to.
6241996	eng	I hope you don't get tired of doing that.
6241997	eng	I think Tom won't be busy this evening.
6241998	eng	Tom wouldn't do that if he didn't have to.
6241999	eng	I hope you didn't put sugar in my coffee.
6242000	eng	I think Tom will do that at about 2:30.
6242001	eng	Tom wouldn't do that even if you paid him.
6242002	eng	I hope I don't have to work this weekend.
6242003	eng	I think Tom will be tempted to do that.
6242004	eng	Tom wouldn't be foolish enough to do that.
6242005	eng	I heard that you paid someone to do that.
6242006	eng	I think Tom will be nervous doing that.
6242007	eng	Tom would never try to do that by himself.
6242008	eng	I go to bed at the same time every night.
6242009	eng	I think Tom needs to get more exercise.
6242010	eng	Tom would be warm if he wore his new coat.
6242011	eng	I feed my dog at the same time every day.
6242012	eng	I think Tom is the only one with a key.
6242013	eng	Tom would be in Boston now if he could be.
6242014	eng	I expect you to do the same thing I'm doing.
6242015	eng	I think Tom is still afraid to do that.
6242016	eng	Tom won't need to go to Boston this month.
6242017	eng	I don't yet know whether I can go or not.
6242018	eng	I think Tom is getting more suspicious.
6242019	eng	Tom won't likely comment on the situation.
6242020	eng	I don't want to work on an assembly line.
6242021	eng	I think Tom has the ability to do that.
6242022	eng	Tom won't likely be in Boston next Monday.

6242025	eng	Tom won't have to go to Boston this month.
6242026	eng	I don't want to talk about what happened.

6242028	eng	Tom won't be permitted to do that anymore.
6242029	eng	I don't want to spend all day at the zoo.
6242030	eng	I think Tom could still do that better.
6242031	eng	Tom won't be coming to Boston this summer.
6242032	eng	I don't want to sell any of my paintings.
6242033	eng	I think Tom could force you to do that.
6242034	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without help.
6242035	eng	I don't want to jump into the cold water.
6242036	eng	I think I'm in love with Tom's ex-wife.
6242037	eng	Tom will probably be skeptical about that.
6242038	eng	I don't want to go back to the orphanage.
6242039	eng	I shouldn't have done that without Tom.
6242040	eng	Tom will probably be reluctant to do that.
6242041	eng	I don't want to feed my dog dry dog food.
6242042	eng	I should've told Tom to stay in Boston.
6242043	eng	Tom will probably be motivated to do that.
6242044	eng	I don't want to do my homework right now.
6242046	eng	Tom will probably be desperate to do that.
6242047	eng	I don't want to call attention to myself.
6242048	eng	I should wait here until Tom gets here.
6242049	eng	Tom will probably be charged with perjury.
6242050	eng	I don't want anyone to see me doing that.
6242051	eng	I should tell Tom why I had to do that.
6242052	eng	Tom will probably be back by October 20th.
6242053	eng	I don't understand why I need to do that.
6242054	eng	I should tell Tom what he needs to buy.
6242055	eng	Tom will probably be annoyed by the smell.
6242056	eng	I don't understand why I have to do that.
6242057	eng	I should tell Tom that I won't do that.
6242058	eng	Tom will get into trouble if he does that.
6242059	eng	I don't think anybody else wants to come.
6242060	eng	I should tell Tom that I need his help.
6242061	eng	Tom will do that at the first opportunity.
6242062	eng	I don't think I've ever seen you do that.
6242063	eng	I should tell Tom not to do that again.
6242064	eng	Tom will come if he's free this afternoon.
6242065	eng	I don't think I'm going to do that again.
6242066	eng	I should do that the way Tom showed me.
6242067	eng	Tom will come back the day after tomorrow.
6242068	eng	I don't think I'll be doing that anymore.
6242069	eng	I saw Tom doing that just this morning.
6242070	eng	Tom will be very hungry when he gets home.
6242071	eng	I don't think I'll be allowed to do that.
6242072	eng	I promised Tom I wouldn't go to Boston.
6242073	eng	Tom will be in Boston the week after next.
6242074	eng	I don't think I'll be able to come tomorrow.
6242075	eng	I need to do that before Tom gets here.
6242076	eng	Tom will be gone by the time we get there.
6242077	eng	I don't think I'd ever want to live here.
6242078	eng	I know why Tom was supposed to do that.
6242079	eng	Tom will be going back to Boston tomorrow.
6242080	eng	I don't think I want to do that with you.
6242081	eng	I know why Tom doesn't need to do that.
6242082	eng	Tom went swimming with all the other boys.
6242083	eng	I don't think I should do that by myself.
6242084	eng	I know why Tom doesn't like doing that.
6242085	eng	Tom watched TV for three hours last night.
6242086	eng	I don't think I really needed to do that.
6242087	eng	I know why Tom doesn't have to do that.
6242088	eng	Tom wasn't very troubled by what happened.
6242089	eng	I don't spend enough time with my family.
6242090	eng	I know what'll happen if Tom does that.
6242091	eng	Tom wasn't able to keep up with his class.
6242092	eng	I don't really plan to stay up all night.
6242093	eng	I know that Tom isn't eager to do that.
6242094	eng	Tom was the only one who couldn't do that.
6242095	eng	I don't plan to stay in Boston very long.
6242096	eng	I know that Tom is planning to do that.
6242097	eng	Tom was the only one permitted to do that.
6242098	eng	I don't need to go to school next Monday.
6242099	eng	I know Tom doesn't want to get married.
6242100	eng	Tom was still doing that when I got there.
6242101	eng	I don't like what you're doing right now.
6242102	eng	I knew Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6242103	eng	Tom was never told what actually happened.
6242104	eng	I don't like to tell people how old I am.
6242105	eng	I knew Tom might want to do that today.
6242106	eng	Tom was never given the chance to do that.
6242107	eng	I don't like anybody and nobody likes me.
6242108	eng	I knew Tom might need to do that today.
6242109	eng	Tom was my French teacher for three years.
6242110	eng	I don't know why I'm supposed to do that.
6242111	eng	I knew Tom might have to do that today.
6242112	eng	Tom was found dead in his house yesterday.
6242113	eng	I don't know who to give the envelope to.
6242114	eng	I knew Tom might be allowed to do that.
6242115	eng	Tom was actually not the one who did that.
6242116	eng	I don't know who I should ask to help me.
6242117	eng	I informed Tom that I wouldn't do that.
6242118	eng	Tom wanted to be the first one to do that.
6242119	eng	I don't know who I should ask for advice.
6242120	eng	I hope Tom won't be allowed to do that.
6242121	eng	Tom wanted me to teach him how to do that.
6242122	eng	I don't know whether I'll do that or not.
6242123	eng	I hope Tom knows why he has to do that.
6242124	eng	Tom wanted me to give him time to do that.
6242125	eng	I don't know what's going to happen next.
6242126	eng	I hope Tom knows what needs to be done.
6242127	eng	Tom walks through this park every morning.
6242128	eng	I don't know what kind of music you like.
6242129	eng	I hope Tom isn't in Boston next Monday.
6242130	eng	Tom waited three hours and then went home.
6242131	eng	I don't know if I'm permitted to do that.
6242132	eng	I hope Tom isn't determined to do that.
6242133	eng	Tom used to be able to do that quite well.
6242134	eng	I don't know if I have to do that or not.
6242135	eng	I hope Tom is the first one to do that.
6242136	eng	Tom used to be able to do that by himself.
6242137	eng	I don't know how to play the tin whistle.
6242138	eng	I hope Tom is interested in doing that.
6242139	eng	Tom took a handkerchief out of his pocket.
6242140	eng	I don't know exactly what has to be done.
6242141	eng	I hope Tom can teach me how to do that.
6242142	eng	Tom told us about his last trip to Boston.
6242143	eng	I don't know exactly how much it'll cost.
6242144	eng	I heard that Tom is good at doing that.
6242145	eng	Tom told me why he wasn't able to do that.
6242146	eng	I don't know a lot about classical music.
6242147	eng	I heard that Tom has been hospitalized.
6242148	eng	Tom told me why he didn't want to do that.
6242150	eng	I hear Tom is going to quit doing that.
6242151	eng	Tom told me to be sure to try and do that.
6242152	eng	I don't have very many friends in Boston.
6242153	eng	I haven't done that since Tom left.
6242154	eng	Tom told me that he's prepared to do that.
6242155	eng	I don't have to go to school next Monday.
6242156	eng	I have to help Tom take out the garbage.
6242157	eng	Tom told me that he's hesitant to do that.
6242158	eng	I don't have to get up so early tomorrow.
6242159	eng	I have to do that before Tom gets here.
6242160	eng	Tom told me that he'd be here early today.
6242161	eng	I don't have the skill needed to do that.
6242162	eng	I forgot that Tom would do that for us.
6242163	eng	Tom told me that he won't do that anymore.
6242164	eng	I don't have as much energy as I used to.
6242165	eng	I expected Tom to do the same thing I did.
6242166	eng	Tom told me last week he wouldn't do that.
6242167	eng	I don't have anything I need to do today.
6242168	eng	I expect you to do the same thing Tom did.
6242169	eng	Tom told me he didn't remember doing that.
6242170	eng	I don't have anything I have to do today.
6242171	eng	I expect I'll have to buy that for Tom.
6242172	eng	Tom thought the burning car would explode.
6242173	eng	I don't have any friends here except you.
6242174	eng	I don't want to wear Tom's old clothes.
6242175	eng	Tom thinks that doing that is a good idea.
6242176	eng	I don't have a choice. I have to do that.
6242177	eng	I don't want to invite Tom to my party.
6242178	eng	Tom thinks doing that would be worthwhile.
6242179	eng	I don't get as much exercise as I should.
6242180	eng	I don't want to be seen talking to Tom.
6242181	eng	Tom tends to only do what he's told to do.
6242182	eng	I don't allow my children to eat cookies.
6242183	eng	I don't want anyone to see me with Tom.
6242184	eng	Tom suggested it would be wise to do that.
6242185	eng	I don't actually need to do that anymore.
6242186	eng	I don't want Tom to see what I'm doing.
6242187	eng	Tom stirred his coffee before drinking it.
6242188	eng	I do want to do that at least once again.
6242189	eng	I don't want Tom to know what happened.
6242190	eng	Tom still has to read three more chapters.
6242191	eng	I didn't want to go camping last weekend.
6242192	eng	I don't want Tom to find out the truth.
6242193	eng	Tom still has time to do that before 2:30.
6242194	eng	I didn't want to deal with what happened.
6242195	eng	I don't want Tom to ever do that again.
6242196	eng	Tom started plowing right after breakfast.
6242197	eng	I didn't want to admit that I was scared.
6242198	eng	I don't want Tom to do that by himself.
6242199	eng	Tom started going bald when he was thirty.
6242200	eng	I didn't think you'd be doing that today.
6242201	eng	I don't think we can trust Tom anymore.
6242202	eng	Tom spent more than three years in prison.
6242203	eng	I didn't think I'd need to do that again.
6242204	eng	I don't think that Tom would lie to me.
6242205	eng	Tom spent a lot of time in Boston in 2013.
6242206	eng	I didn't think I'd have to do that again.
6242207	eng	I don't think Tom would still be awake.
6242208	eng	Tom soon found out how bad the roads were.
6242209	eng	I didn't tell that girl who I really was.
6242210	eng	I don't think Tom would really do that.
6242211	eng	Tom smokes three packs of cigarettes a day.
6242212	eng	I didn't speak at all during the meeting.
6242213	eng	I don't think Tom would let me do that.
6242214	eng	Tom should've chosen to do something else.
6242215	eng	I didn't really feel like playing tennis.
6242216	eng	I don't think Tom would be discouraged.
6242217	eng	Tom should've been here with us yesterday.
6242218	eng	I didn't realize you knew how to do that.
6242219	eng	I don't think Tom will need to do that.
6242220	eng	Tom should've been able to do that easily.
6242221	eng	I didn't realize what was expected of me.
6242222	eng	I don't think Tom will like doing that.
6242223	eng	Tom should stay in Boston for a few weeks.
6242224	eng	I didn't realize how late it was getting.
6242225	eng	I don't think Tom will have to do that.
6242226	eng	Tom should have one of us do that for him.
6242227	eng	I didn't notice the surveillance cameras.
6242228	eng	I don't think Tom will do that for you.
6242229	eng	Tom should be finished doing that by 2:30.
6242230	eng	I didn't miss my wallet until I got home.
6242231	eng	I don't think Tom should do that again.
6242232	eng	Tom should be able to do that if he tries.
6242233	eng	I didn't know you used to work in Boston.
6242234	eng	I don't think Tom should be doing that.
6242235	eng	Tom seems to know what he's talking about.

6242241	eng	Tom seems to have lost interest in sports.
6242242	eng	I didn't know where I was supposed to go.
6242243	eng	I don't think Tom does that very often.
6242244	eng	Tom seems to be willing to do that for us.
6242245	eng	I didn't know what you were trying to do.
6242246	eng	I don't think I can get Tom to do that.
6242247	eng	Tom seems to be aware of what's happening.
6242248	eng	I didn't know what I was doing was wrong.
6242249	eng	I don't remember where I first met Tom.
6242250	eng	Tom seems to be amused by what's going on.
6242251	eng	I didn't know that you wouldn't be there.
6242252	eng	I don't remember asking Tom to do that.

6242257	eng	I didn't know that you had so much money.
6242258	eng	I don't really think Tom could do that.
6242259	eng	Tom says his stomach doesn't hurt anymore.
6242260	eng	I didn't know that the bridge was closed.
6242261	eng	I don't need to know who told Tom that.
6242262	eng	Tom says he's willing to buy that for you.
6242263	eng	I didn't know it was possible to do that.
6242264	eng	I don't need to know how Tom does that.
6242265	eng	Tom says he's never been to Boston before.
6242266	eng	I didn't know if I should really do that.
6242267	eng	I don't like Tom telling me what to do.
6242268	eng	Tom says he's given up making predictions.
6242269	eng	I didn't know if I had to do that or not.
6242270	eng	I don't let Tom go swimming by himself.

6242318	eng	I can't remember what I was going to say.
6242319	eng	I don't have as much money as Tom does.
6242320	eng	Tom says he certainly won't do that again.
6242321	eng	I can do that with you if you want me to.
6242322	eng	I don't expect Tom to get here on time.
6242323	eng	Tom says he can't wait for that to happen.
6242324	eng	I can always go back to my parents' home.
6242325	eng	I don't care what time Tom goes to bed.
6242326	eng	Tom says he doesn't feel like doing that now.
6242327	eng	I bought some green peppers and tomatoes.
6242328	eng	I don't believe those rumors about Tom.
6242329	eng	Tom said he wanted to do that, but he didn't.
6242330	eng	I ate supper and immediately went to bed.
6242331	eng	I don't believe Tom would ever do that.
6242332	eng	Tom said three of those boys will help us.
6242333	eng	I already know you want to quit your job.
6242334	eng	I do almost the same thing as Tom does.
6242335	eng	Tom said three of those boys are his sons.
6242336	eng	I almost never do that while I'm driving.
6242337	eng	I didn't want to sing, but Tom made me.
6242338	eng	Tom said three of those boys are brothers.
6242339	eng	I admitted that I didn't know what to do.
6242340	eng	I didn't want to let Tom into my house.
6242341	eng	Tom said there are now 300 employees here.
6242342	eng	How often do you write letters in French?
6242343	eng	I didn't want to go to Boston with Tom.
6242344	eng	Tom said the mosquitoes didn't bother him.
6242345	eng	How much beer did you drink last weekend?
6242346	eng	I didn't want to eat the stew Tom made.
6242347	eng	Tom said the building was 300 meters tall.
6242348	eng	How many years have you spent doing that?
6242349	eng	I didn't want to do what Tom suggested.
6242350	eng	Tom said that wasn't what he wanted to do.
6242351	eng	How many weeks have you spent doing that?
6242352	eng	I didn't want to answer Tom's question.
6242353	eng	Tom said that probably won't happen again.
6242354	eng	How many times have you climbed Mt. Fuji?
6242355	eng	I didn't think that would frighten Tom.
6242356	eng	Tom said that he'll go to Boston tomorrow.
6242357	eng	How many seconds does it take to do that?
6242358	eng	I didn't think that Tom was having fun.
6242359	eng	Tom said that he wouldn't wait any longer.
6242360	eng	How many nights do you plan to stay here?
6242361	eng	I didn't think Tom would do that again.
6242362	eng	Tom said that he wouldn't do that anymore.
6242363	eng	How many movies did you watch last month?
6242364	eng	I didn't think Tom would be suspicious.
6242365	eng	Tom said that he wasn't a student anymore.
6242366	eng	How many months have you been doing that?
6242367	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so annoyed.
6242368	eng	Tom said that he shouldn't have done that.
6242369	eng	How many months did you spend doing that?
6242370	eng	I didn't think Tom would be reasonable.
6242371	eng	Tom said that he really wanted to do that.
6242372	eng	How many minutes will it take to do that?
6242373	eng	I didn't think Tom would be interested.
6242374	eng	Tom said that he enjoyed your party a lot.
6242375	eng	How many minutes does it take to do that?
6242376	eng	I didn't think Tom would be here today.
6242377	eng	Tom said that he couldn't wait to do that.
6242378	eng	How many hours have you spent doing that?
6242379	eng	I didn't think Tom would be frightened.
6242380	eng	Tom said it would be too risky to do that.
6242381	eng	How many days will it take us to do that?
6242382	eng	I didn't think Tom would be doing that.
6242383	eng	Tom said it wasn't likely to happen again.
6242384	eng	How many days did it take you to do that?
6242385	eng	I didn't think Tom should've done that.
6242386	eng	Tom said it was him who needed to do that.
6242388	eng	I didn't think Tom knew how to do that.
6242389	eng	Tom said his schedule is likely to change.
6242390	eng	How many African animals are in this zoo?
6242391	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I had to do that.
6242392	eng	Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us.
6242393	eng	How long have you been looking for a job?
6242394	eng	I didn't tell Tom when I'd be arriving.
6242395	eng	Tom said he's reluctant to do that for me.
6242396	eng	How long does it take to get to the airport?
6242397	eng	I didn't tell Tom what the problem was.
6242398	eng	Tom said he's never considered doing that.
6242399	eng	Everything I need to buy is on this list.
6242400	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he needed to do.
6242401	eng	Tom said he's glad he was able to do that.
6242402	eng	Everybody in the room did the same thing over and over again.
6242403	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I wanted to eat.
6242404	eng	Tom said he's been told not do that again.
6242405	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary not to do that.
6242406	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I wanted to buy.
6242407	eng	Tom said he's been asked to do that again.
6242408	eng	Don't do that again unless I tell you to.
6242409	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I needed to buy.
6242410	eng	Tom said he's always lived on Park Street.
6242411	eng	Doing that will be easier than you think.
6242412	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I'd been mugged.
6242413	eng	Tom said he'll be the next one to do that.
6242414	eng	Doing that probably won't be interesting.
6242415	eng	I didn't tell Tom how many eggs to buy.
6242416	eng	Tom said he'll be the last one to do that.
6242417	eng	Doing that is a lot easier than it looks.
6242418	eng	I didn't tell Tom I'd never done that.
6242419	eng	Tom said he'd never permit you to do that.
6242420	eng	Doing it that way would be too expensive.
6242421	eng	I didn't tell Tom I didn't like my job.
6242422	eng	Tom said he'd do that in a couple of days.
6242423	eng	Do you think you'd be nervous doing that?
6242424	eng	I didn't speak to Tom at all yesterday.
6242425	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to do that for free.
6242426	eng	Do you think this water is safe to drink?
6242427	eng	I didn't realize how much Tom loved me.
6242428	eng	Tom said he'd be the first one to do that.
6242429	eng	Do you think it would be safe to do that?
6242430	eng	I didn't realize Tom shouldn't do that.
6242431	eng	Tom said he'd be glad to buy that for you.
6242432	eng	Do you think doing that will really help?
6242433	eng	I didn't realize Tom needed to do that.
6242434	eng	Tom said he wouldn't recommend doing that.
6242435	eng	Do you really think it's wise to do that?
6242436	eng	I didn't like any of Tom's suggestions.
6242437	eng	Tom said he wouldn't like to do that here.
6242438	eng	Do you really think it's safe to do that?
6242439	eng	I didn't know who Tom's girlfriend was.
6242440	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be afraid to do that.
6242441	eng	Do you really think it's easy to do that?
6242442	eng	I didn't know what Tom was going to do.
6242443	eng	Tom said he wished he knew how to do that.
6242444	eng	Do you know anyone who's very overweight?
6242445	eng	I didn't know what Tom wanted me to do.
6242446	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't been so late.
6242447	eng	Do you know anyone who's gotten divorced?
6242448	eng	I didn't know that you were dating Tom.
6242449	eng	Tom said he wasn't in Boston at that time.
6242450	eng	Do you intend to go to Boston in October?
6242451	eng	I didn't know that you were Tom's wife.
6242452	eng	Tom said he was worried about the weather.
6242453	eng	Do that quickly before it starts to rain.
6242454	eng	I didn't know that Tom was lying to me.
6242455	eng	Tom said he was willing to take that risk.
6242456	eng	Didn't you know what was going to happen?
6242457	eng	I didn't know that Tom used to do that.
6242458	eng	Tom said he was willing to do the driving.
6242459	eng	Didn't you know this was going to happen?
6242460	eng	I didn't know Tom was such a good cook.
6242461	eng	Tom said he was willing to do that for us.
6242462	eng	Didn't you know I didn't need to do that?
6242463	eng	I didn't know Tom was still doing that.
6242464	eng	Tom said he was told not to do that again.
6242465	eng	Didn't you know I didn't have to do that?
6242466	eng	I didn't know Tom spoke French so well.
6242467	eng	Tom said he was thinking about doing that.
6242468	eng	Did you know that your socks don't match?
6242469	eng	I didn't know Tom and you were cousins.
6242470	eng	Tom said he was the only one who did that.
6242471	eng	Did you know Mary and Alice were sisters?
6242472	eng	I didn't have a chance to speak to Tom.
6242473	eng	Tom said he was going to do that tomorrow.
6242474	eng	Did you know I was going to get arrested?
6242475	eng	I didn't go there, and neither did Tom.
6242476	eng	Tom said he was determined not to do that.
6242477	eng	Could you show me a safer way to do that?
6242478	eng	I didn't go because Tom told me not to.
6242479	eng	Tom said he wants to stay at home all day.
6242480	eng	Could you put this book on the top shelf?
6242481	eng	I didn't give Tom what he asked me for.
6242482	eng	Tom said he tried doing that once himself.
6242483	eng	Could you fill up this bottle with water?
6242484	eng	I didn't feel I needed to wait for Tom.
6242485	eng	Tom said he thought I'd regret doing that.
6242486	eng	Could you explain to me how you did that?
6242487	eng	I didn't expect Tom to want to do that.
6242488	eng	Tom said he thought I should study harder.
6242489	eng	Could you come over to my place tomorrow?
6242490	eng	I didn't expect Tom to show up on time.
6242491	eng	Tom said he thought I should study French.
6242492	eng	Can you tell me what you're trying to do?
6242493	eng	I didn't expect Tom to react like that.
6242494	eng	Tom said he really regrets not doing that.
6242495	eng	Can you really stay in Boston all summer?
6242496	eng	I didn't choose the same thing Tom did.
6242497	eng	Tom said he never wanted to do that again.
6242498	eng	Both of my grandmothers are still living.
6242499	eng	I did what I could to help Tom do that.
6242500	eng	Tom said he never expected this to happen.
6242501	eng	Are you the one who wanted me to do that?
6242502	eng	I can't play the mandolin, but Tom can.
6242503	eng	Tom said he needs to learn how to do that.
6242505	eng	I assumed Tom wouldn't want to do that.
6242506	eng	Tom said he knew what was going to happen.
6242507	eng	Are you packed and ready to go to Boston?
6242508	eng	I asked Tom to teach me how to do that.
6242509	eng	Tom said he knew he might need to do that.
6242510	eng	Are we going to be in Boston next winter?
6242511	eng	I already know what Tom is going to do.
6242512	eng	Tom said he knew he might have to do that.
6242513	eng	Are there any customers in the store now?
6242514	eng	How often is Tom late for appointments?
6242515	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be able to help us.
6242516	eng	All four of my grandparents died in 2013.
6242517	eng	How often does Tom eat dinner with you?
6242518	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be able to do that.
6242519	eng	A few people at the party were Canadians.
6242520	eng	How often do you go to Boston with Tom?
6242521	eng	Tom said he hasn't noticed any difference.
6242522	eng	Yours is better than that one, isn't it?
6242523	eng	How many years has Tom been doing that?
6242524	eng	Tom said he got paid extra for doing that.
6242525	eng	You've made me very happy by doing that.
6242526	eng	How many weeks has Tom been doing that?
6242527	eng	Tom said he found it difficult to do that.
6242528	eng	You've already eaten lunch, haven't you?
6242529	eng	How many times a year does Tom do that?
6242530	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that again.
6242531	eng	You're too short to do that, aren't you?
6242532	eng	How many times a week does Tom do that?
6242533	eng	Tom said he doesn't think you can do that.
6242534	eng	You're the person I've been waiting for.
6242535	eng	How many hours has Tom been doing that?
6242536	eng	Tom said he doesn't have health insurance.
6242537	eng	You're the only one who passed the test.
6242538	eng	How many days has Tom spent doing that?
6242539	eng	Tom said he didn't want to try doing that.
6242540	eng	You're the one who should be doing that.
6242541	eng	How did you know what Tom needed to do?
6242542	eng	Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston.
6242543	eng	You're the first person to ever help me.
6242544	eng	Has Tom ever stayed with you in Boston?
6242545	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do it that way.
6242546	eng	You're ready to do that now, aren't you?
6242547	eng	From what I've heard, Tom doesn't do that.
6242548	eng	Tom said he didn't think he could do that.
6242549	eng	You're preparing to do that, aren't you?
6242550	eng	Don't you want Tom to buy that for you?
6242551	eng	Tom said he didn't really want to do that.
6242552	eng	You're one of the tallest people I know.
6242553	eng	Don't permit Tom to do that by himself.
6242554	eng	Tom said he didn't really need to do that.
6242555	eng	You're not as old as I thought you were.
6242556	eng	Don't expect Tom to ever do that again.
6242557	eng	Tom said he didn't really have to do that.
6242558	eng	You're not a very good swimmer, are you?
6242559	eng	Doing that would really make Tom happy.
6242560	eng	Tom said he didn't mind doing that at all.
6242561	eng	You're motivated to do that, aren't you?
6242562	eng	Does Tom still work at the post office?
6242563	eng	Tom said he didn't live in Boston anymore.
6242564	eng	You're glad that I did that, aren't you?
6242565	eng	Do you think Tom might be disappointed?
6242566	eng	Tom said he couldn't understand my French.
6242567	eng	You're a student at Harvard, aren't you?
6242568	eng	Do you think Tom is through doing that?
6242569	eng	Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
6242570	eng	You're a popular teacher at this school.
6242571	eng	Do you mean you didn't see Tom do that?
6242572	eng	Tom said doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
6242573	eng	You're a little over thirty, aren't you?
6242574	eng	Do you know why Tom and I were arguing?
6242575	eng	Tom said doing that would be a lot of fun.
6242576	eng	You're a hardworking person, aren't you?
6242577	eng	Do you know the reason why Tom is late?
6242578	eng	Tom said doing that would be a good thing.
6242579	eng	You won't have the chance to do that.
6242580	eng	Do you know how Tom sprained his ankle?
6242581	eng	Tom said I was the one who should do that.
6242582	eng	You'll do that the next time, won't you?
6242583	eng	Didn't you know where Tom wanted to go?
6242584	eng	Tom said I should've done that last month.
6242585	eng	You'll be punished if you do that again.
6242586	eng	Didn't you know that Tom would do that?
6242587	eng	Tom said I didn't sound very enthusiastic.
6242588	eng	You'll be arrested if you do that again.
6242589	eng	Didn't you know that Tom would be here?
6242590	eng	Tom refused to do what I wanted him to do.
6242591	eng	You wouldn't mind doing that, would you?
6242592	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was a painter?
6242593	eng	Tom recommends that you not do that again.
6242595	eng	Didn't you know Tom was living with us?
6242596	eng	Tom quit his job soon after his wife died.
6242597	eng	You won't do that by yourself, will you?
6242598	eng	Didn't you know Tom plays the clarinet?
6242599	eng	Tom put on someone else's coat by mistake.
6242600	eng	You won't be permitted to do that again.
6242601	eng	Didn't you know Tom is good at cooking?
6242602	eng	Tom promised us he wouldn't do that again.
6242603	eng	You won't be allowed to do that anymore.
6242604	eng	Didn't you know Tom enjoyed doing that?
6242605	eng	Tom probably won't have to wait very long.
6242606	eng	You weren't forced to do that, were you?
6242607	eng	Didn't you know Tom didn't need a visa?
6242608	eng	Tom probably won't be doing that tomorrow.
6242609	eng	You weren't afraid to do that, were you?
6242610	eng	Didn't you know Tom could speak French?
6242611	eng	Tom probably won't be called as a witness.
6242612	eng	You were the one who told us to do that.
6242613	eng	Didn't you know Tom and I were married?
6242614	eng	Tom probably shouldn't do that by himself.
6242615	eng	You were scared to do that, weren't you?
6242616	eng	Did you know that Tom wouldn't do that?
6242617	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I'm hungry.
6242618	eng	You were in Boston in 2013, weren't you?
6242619	eng	Did you know that Tom is in Boston now?
6242620	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I hate him.
6242621	eng	You were hoping to do that, weren't you?
6242622	eng	Did you know that Tom is afraid of you?
6242623	eng	Tom probably doesn't have time to do that.
6242624	eng	You were forced to do that, weren't you?
6242625	eng	Did you know Tom was going to say that?
6242626	eng	Tom pretended he didn't understand French.
6242627	eng	You think you should do that, don't you?
6242628	eng	Did you know Tom was going to be there?
6242629	eng	Tom plays the banjo as well as the guitar.
6242630	eng	You think I'll do that later, don't you?
6242631	eng	Did you know Tom was going to be fired?
6242632	eng	Tom packed his lunch in a brown paper bag.
6242633	eng	You think I ought to do that, don't you?
6242634	eng	Did you know Tom was coming here today?
6242635	eng	Tom only has three hours to get that done.
6242636	eng	You shouldn't do that until I get there.
6242637	eng	Both Tom and his son have been injured.
6242638	eng	Tom only did that because you told him to.
6242639	eng	You should've refused to stay in Boston.
6242640	eng	Ask Tom if he wants to eat out tonight.
6242641	eng	Tom often helps his mother in the kitchen.
6242642	eng	You should wait until Monday to do that.
6242643	eng	Ask Tom if he wants to do that with us.
6242644	eng	Tom often falls asleep in front of the TV.
6242645	eng	You should have someone do that for you.
6242646	eng	Ask Tom if he can go to Boston with us.
6242647	eng	Tom noticed that the garage door was open.
6242648	eng	You should be through doing that by now.
6242649	eng	As a matter of fact, Tom can't do that.
6242650	eng	Tom never takes me out for dinner anymore.
6242651	eng	You should be doing that somewhere else.
6242652	eng	Aren't you mad that Tom didn't do that?
6242653	eng	Tom moved to Boston just three months ago.
6242654	eng	You should be doing that someplace else.
6242655	eng	You're doing that for Tom, aren't you?
6242656	eng	Tom looked like he was enjoying the party.
6242657	eng	You seemed shy the first time I met you.
6242658	eng	You'd better tell Tom to do that, too.
6242659	eng	Tom lives in Boston with his grandparents.
6242660	eng	You promised you wouldn't do that today.
6242661	eng	You were lucky Tom helped you do that.
6242662	eng	Tom let me know that he wanted to do that.
6242663	eng	You promised you wouldn't do that again.
6242664	eng	You told Tom you did that, didn't you?
6242665	eng	Tom left the room to get a glass of water.
6242666	eng	You promised to do that, but you didn't.
6242667	eng	You think Tom will do that, don't you?
6242668	eng	Tom leaves for work at 6:30 every morning.
6242669	eng	You may use my surfboard if you want to.
6242670	eng	You still don't like Tom much, do you?
6242671	eng	Tom learned how to do that just last year.
6242672	eng	You may use my lawnmower if you want to.
6242673	eng	You spoke French with Tom, didn't you?
6242674	eng	Tom knows who can sing well and who can't.
6242675	eng	You may pick as many apples as you want.
6242676	eng	You should tell Tom you won't do that.
6242677	eng	Tom knows that now is the time to do that.
6242678	eng	You may eat as many cookies as you want.
6242679	eng	You should tell Tom you can't do that.
6242680	eng	Tom knows it isn't a good idea to do that.
6242681	eng	You look like you're enjoying the party.
6242682	eng	You should get Tom to do that for you.
6242683	eng	Tom knows he's not supposed to park there.
6242684	eng	You look like you don't know what to do.
6242685	eng	You should do that the way Tom did it.
6242686	eng	Tom knows I was supposed to do that today.
6242687	eng	You look just like a guy I used to know.
6242688	eng	You seem to be a lot smarter than Tom.
6242689	eng	Tom knew it wasn't a good idea to do that.
6242690	eng	You know I'd hate to do that, don't you?
6242691	eng	You know Tom can't do that, don't you?
6242692	eng	Tom isn't very likely to enjoy that movie.
6242693	eng	You know I shouldn't do that, don't you?
6242694	eng	You hope Tom won't do that, don't you?
6242695	eng	Tom isn't very good at doing that, either.
6242696	eng	You know I can't be in Boston next week.
6242697	eng	You don't want Tom to help me, do you?
6242698	eng	Tom isn't under any obligation to do that.
6242699	eng	You knew I couldn't do that, didn't you?
6242700	eng	You don't want Tom to do that, do you?
6242701	eng	Tom isn't sure who to give the message to.
6242702	eng	You have to do that as soon as possible.
6242703	eng	You don't want Tom doing that, do you?
6242704	eng	Tom isn't supposed to be doing that today.
6242705	vie	Chúng nó cưới nhau rồi.
6242706	spa	Amor sin amor, se paga.
6242707	eng	You gave a speech yesterday, didn't you?
6242708	eng	You don't like Tom doing that, do you?
6242709	eng	Tom isn't really sure what he ought to do.
6242710	eng	You don't want to do that today, do you?
6242711	eng	You did the same thing Tom did, right?
6242712	eng	Tom isn't really sure what he needs to do.
6242713	eng	You don't want to do that again, do you?
6242714	eng	You always do that for Tom, don't you?
6242715	eng	Tom isn't likely to permit you to do that.
6242716	eng	You don't think I could do that, do you?
6242717	eng	Would Tom still be willing to do that?
6242718	eng	Tom isn't likely to be in Boston now.
6242719	eng	You don't still want to do that, do you?
6242720	eng	Why wasn't Tom in Boston last weekend?
6242721	eng	Tom isn't going to hang out with us today.
6242722	eng	You don't still need to do that, do you?
6242723	eng	Why didn't Tom need to be there early?
6242724	eng	Tom is too serious to consider doing that.
6242725	eng	You don't still have to do that, do you?
6242726	eng	Who told you Tom didn't like hot food?
6242727	eng	Tom is the only one who's overweight here.
6242728	eng	You don't seem to be willing to do that.
6242729	eng	What should we do after Tom gets here?
6242730	eng	Tom is the only one who needed to do that.
6242731	eng	You don't really care what I do, do you?
6242732	eng	What kind of trouble did Tom get into?
6242733	eng	Tom is the only one who enjoys doing that.
6242734	eng	You don't need my permission to do that.
6242735	eng	What kind of treatment is Tom getting?
6242736	eng	Tom is the most likely to want to do that.
6242737	eng	You don't know what you've been missing.
6242738	eng	What did you tell Tom he needed to do?
6242739	eng	Tom is the guy over there with brown hair.
6242740	eng	You don't have to get up early tomorrow.
6242741	eng	What color shirt is Tom wearing today?
6242742	eng	Tom is the first boy I ever went out with.
6242743	eng	You don't have to do that today, do you?
6242744	eng	What I'll do depends on what Tom does.
6242745	eng	Tom is still thinking about what happened.
6242746	eng	You don't have the authority to do that.
6242747	eng	Were you in Boston with Tom last week?
6242748	eng	Tom is still reluctant to do that for you.
6242749	eng	You don't believe I can do that, do you?
6242750	eng	We should let Tom go home early today.
6242751	eng	Tom is sick, so he probably won't do that.
6242752	eng	You didn't want to do that, did you?
6242753	eng	There's no way Tom would've done that.
6242754	eng	Tom is sick, so he can't do that today.
6242755	eng	You didn't look like you were surprised.
6242756	eng	The problem is that Tom won't do that.
6242757	eng	Tom is scheduled to speak on October 20th.
6242758	eng	You didn't look like you were exhausted.
6242759	eng	The problem is that Tom can't do that.
6242760	eng	Tom is saving money so he can buy a house.
6242761	eng	You didn't get paid to do that, did you?
6242762	eng	The only one under thirty here is Tom.
6242763	eng	Tom is probably studying French right now.
6242764	eng	You didn't even try to do that, did you?
6242765	eng	The only one here who's afraid is Tom.
6242766	eng	Tom is one of the three guys who did that.
6242767	eng	You didn't come here yesterday, did you?
6242768	eng	The money Tom found was in $100 bills.
6242769	eng	Tom is one of the stingiest people I know.
6242770	eng	You did that three days ago, didn't you?
6242771	eng	The DA said he wouldn't prosecute Tom.
6242772	eng	Tom is lucky to have so many good friends.
6242773	eng	You bought a coat yesterday, didn't you?
6242774	eng	Tell Tom he has to do that by himself.
6242775	eng	Tom is likely to be outside near the pool.
6242776	eng	You bought a bottle of wine, didn't you?
6242777	eng	Tell Tom I won't study French tonight.
6242778	eng	Tom is likely to be in Boston next Monday.
6242779	eng	You aren't supposed to be here, are you?
6242780	eng	Please tell Tom to do that by himself.
6242781	eng	Tom is likely to be determined to do that.
6242782	eng	You apparently shouldn't have done that.
6242783	eng	Please tell Tom I won't do that again.
6242784	eng	Tom is likely to be hungry when he gets home.
6242785	eng	You already seem to know how to do that.
6242786	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't understand French.
6242787	eng	Tom is in his bedroom, counting his money.
6242788	eng	Yesterday was my grandmother's birthday.
6242789	eng	Perhaps Tom can go to Boston with you.
6242790	eng	Tom is good at giving simple explanations.
6242791	eng	Would you give me permission to do that?
6242792	eng	Maybe Tom wasn't the one who did that.
6242793	eng	Tom is going to go to Boston next weekend.
6242794	eng	Will it be all right if I do that today?
6242795	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why we're here.
6242796	eng	Tom is going to Boston again next weekend.
6242797	eng	Why don't you to do that sometime today?
6242798	eng	It's quite possible that Tom did that.
6242799	eng	Tom is busy and can't meet with you today.
6242800	eng	Why do you think people like to do that?
6242801	eng	It's possible that Tom did that alone.
6242802	eng	Tom is among those are planning to attend.
6242803	eng	Who's the tallest person in your family?
6242804	eng	It would be stupid for Tom to do that.
6242805	eng	Tom is also mentioned in the book as well.
6242806	eng	Who's the most creative person you know?
6242807	eng	It would be nice if Tom could do that.
6242808	eng	Tom is actually a very good soccer player.
6242809	eng	Who were you waiting for here yesterday?

6242821	eng	Who told you I wouldn't want to do that?
6242822	eng	It looked like Tom had fun doing that.
6242823	eng	Tom hopes that he doesn't have to do that.
6242824	eng	Which do you like better, coffee or tea?
6242825	eng	Is Tom the only one who can't do that?
6242826	eng	Tom has vowed that he won't do that again.
6242827	eng	When does the bus leave for the airport?
6242828	eng	If I don't do that, Tom will be angry.
6242829	eng	Tom has very little experience doing that.
6242830	eng	When are you going to finish doing that?
6242831	eng	I've made sure that Tom won't do that.
6242832	eng	Tom has until next month to get that done.
6242833	eng	What software do you use the most often?
6242834	eng	I've forgotten the name of Tom's wife.
6242835	eng	Tom has to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6242836	eng	What makes you think we have to do that?
6242837	eng	I'm the only person Tom ever talks to.
6242838	eng	Tom has three times as much money as I do.
6242839	eng	What kinds of books do you like to read?
6242840	eng	I'm sure that's not the movie Tom saw.
6242841	eng	Tom has suggested that we eat out tonight.
6242842	eng	What kind of music do you like the most?
6242843	eng	I'm sure that's not the car Tom wants.
6242844	eng	Tom has lived abroad for most of his life.
6242845	eng	What do you want to do tomorrow morning?
6242846	eng	I'm sure Tom will know how to do that.
6242847	eng	Tom has half again as many stamps as I do.
6242848	eng	We're three months away from graduation.
6242849	eng	I'm sure Tom will be eager to do that.
6242850	eng	Tom has had many opportunities to do that.
6242851	eng	We're going to stay in Boston all month.
6242852	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be alone.
6242853	eng	Tom has enough money to buy what he wants.
6242854	eng	We won't wait for you, so don't be late.
6242855	eng	I'm positive Tom will be able to do that.
6242856	eng	Tom has enough money to buy what he needs.
6242857	eng	We were doing that just a few hours ago.

6242860	eng	We tried many different ways to do that.
6242861	eng	I'm going to Boston with Tom tomorrow.
6242862	eng	Tom has decided to try doing that himself.
6242863	eng	We should talk to each other more often.
6242864	eng	I'm doing the same thing Tom is doing.
6242865	eng	Tom has decided to move back to Australia.
6242866	eng	We really should be in Boston right now.
6242867	eng	I'll do that for Tom if he asks me to.
6242868	eng	Tom has decided to leave tomorrow morning.
6242869	eng	We probably won't have to do that again.
6242870	eng	I'll do that again if Tom wants me to.
6242871	eng	Tom has decided to come back to Australia.
6242872	eng	We need to deal with that problem today.
6242873	eng	I'd rather stay here than go to Tom's.
6242874	eng	Tom has been using crutches to get around.
6242875	eng	We might actually be in Boston all year.
6242876	eng	I'd never seen Tom that scared before.

6242879	eng	I'd never seen Tom that afraid before.
6242880	eng	Tom has been the chairman for three years.
6242881	eng	We have to do that before it's too late.
6242882	eng	I'd expected Tom to do that yesterday.
6242883	eng	Tom has been struggling to make ends meet.
6242884	eng	We got another chance to try doing that.
6242885	eng	I'd expected Tom to do that on Monday.
6242886	eng	Tom has been mugged three times this year.
6242887	eng	We didn't come to Boston last Christmas.
6242888	eng	I'd do that for Tom if he asked me to.
6242889	eng	Tom has been helping me for quite a while.
6242890	eng	We couldn't go to Boston last Christmas.
6242891	eng	I wouldn't forgive Tom if he did that.
6242892	eng	Tom has been doing that since last summer.
6242893	eng	We almost never see rabbits around here.
6242894	eng	I would've advised Tom not to do that.
6242895	eng	Tom has been doing that since he was born.
6242896	eng	Walking the dog is my responsibility.
6242897	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't wear glasses.
6242898	eng	Tom has been asking me a lot of questions.
6242899	eng	Unfortunately, I can't buy that for you.
6242900	eng	I wonder who'll go to Boston with Tom.

6242906	eng	I wonder whether Tom needs to do that.

6242910	eng	Tom has already told me I need to do that.
6242911	eng	This morning's meeting wasn't very long.
6242912	eng	I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
6242913	eng	Tom has already told me I have to do that.
6242914	eng	This kind of weather isn't that unusual.
6242915	eng	I wonder if Tom is tempted to do that.
6242916	eng	Tom has already been here for three hours.
6242917	eng	This is the last time I plan to do this.
6242918	eng	I wonder if Tom has done that already.
6242919	eng	Tom has already apologized for doing that.
6242920	eng	This is a letter from one of my friends.
6242921	eng	I won't permit Tom to do that anymore.
6242922	eng	Tom has advised me not to stop doing that.
6242923	eng	This beach is very popular with surfers.
6242924	eng	I won't be able to get Tom to do that.
6242925	eng	Tom has advised me not to do that anymore.

6242927	eng	I wish I'd never asked Tom to do that.
6242928	eng	Tom has a very beautiful teenage daughter.
6242929	eng	This area is famous for beautiful women.
6242930	eng	I wish I were with Tom back in Boston.
6242931	eng	Tom grows tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.
6242932	eng	They violated the terms of the contract.
6242933	eng	I wish I hadn't played chess with Tom.
6242934	eng	Tom grew a beard so he'd look more mature.
6242935	eng	They come here every day in the evening.
6242936	eng	I wish I could do that as well as Tom.
6242937	eng	Tom got the highest grade on today's test.
6242938	eng	There was nothing I could do about that.
6242939	eng	I wasn't with Tom yesterday afternoon.
6242940	eng	Tom got a very high score on today's test.
6242941	eng	The past three days have been very hard.
6242943	eng	Tom goes to the park almost every morning.
6242944	eng	The past three days have been very cold.
6242945	eng	I was hoping Tom could do that for me.
6242946	eng	Tom gave me advice on which stocks to buy.
6242947	eng	The lady behind the counter seemed nice.
6242948	eng	I was hoping I could help Tom do that.
6242949	eng	Tom gave concerts until his death in 2013.
6242950	eng	The girl carrying a banjo seemed scared.
6242951	eng	I wanted to go wherever Tom was going.
6242952	eng	Tom frequently does that when he's scared.
6242953	eng	The first thing I noticed was the smell.
6242954	eng	I wanted to go to Boston to visit Tom.
6242955	eng	Tom finally managed to buy what he needed.
6242956	eng	The boy carrying a ukulele was barefoot.
6242957	eng	I want to see Tom riding his unicycle.
6242958	eng	Tom doesn't yet realize what he has to do.
6242959	eng	That's the woman who told me what to do.
6242960	eng	I want to know what Tom said about me.
6242961	eng	Tom doesn't want you to do that right now.
6242962	eng	That's the woman who sold me the ticket.
6242963	eng	I want to give my old computer to Tom.

6242966	eng	I want Tom to teach me how to do that.
6242967	eng	Tom doesn't want to be the one to do that.
6242968	eng	That was my first time to eat horsemeat.
6242969	eng	I understand why Tom wants to do that.
6242970	eng	Tom doesn't think you're going to do that.
6242971	eng	Surely you can find the time to do that.
6242972	eng	I tried to talk Tom out of doing that.
6242973	eng	Tom doesn't think you should've done that.
6242974	eng	Shouldn't you be doing that by yourself?
6242975	eng	I tried to help Tom decide what to do.
6242976	eng	Tom doesn't think you know how to do that.
6242978	eng	I told Tom I wouldn't do that for him.
6242979	eng	Tom doesn't think we can do that, does he?
6242980	eng	People hear only what they want to hear.
6242981	eng	I told Tom I thought he could do that.
6242982	eng	Tom doesn't think he's allowed to do that.
6242983	eng	Only teenagers are permitted to do that.
6242984	eng	I thought you said Tom should do that.
6242985	eng	Tom doesn't think he has to do that today.

6242989	eng	One of us has to go to Boston next week.
6242990	eng	I thought you said Tom didn't do that.
6242991	eng	Tom doesn't seem to want to be doing this.
6242992	eng	One of my sisters became an interpreter.
6242993	eng	I thought Tom would refuse to do that.

6242995	eng	My youngest daughter is three years old.
6242996	eng	I thought Tom would do that yesterday.
6242997	eng	Tom doesn't seem aware of what's going on.
6242998	eng	My suitcase is over there next to yours.
6242999	eng	I thought Tom would be retired by now.
6243000	eng	Tom doesn't remember asking me to do that.
6243001	eng	My great-grandfather was a teacher, too.
6243002	eng	I thought Tom would be home on Monday.
6243003	eng	Tom doesn't recommend doing that that way.
6243004	eng	May I leave as soon as I finish my work?

6243008	eng	I thought Tom wasn't going to do that.
6243009	eng	Tom doesn't often get a chance to do that.
6243010	eng	It's very nice of you to do that for me.
6243011	eng	I thought Tom wasn't going to be here.
6243012	eng	Tom doesn't make me laugh like he used to.
6243013	eng	It's time for you to pack up your stuff.
6243014	eng	I thought Tom was unlikely to do that.
6243015	eng	Tom doesn't look even a little bit scared.
6243016	eng	It's quite possible that that'll happen.
6243017	eng	I thought Tom was finished doing that.
6243018	eng	Tom doesn't like to get his picture taken.
6243019	eng	It's been fun hanging out with you guys.
6243020	eng	I thought Tom had forgotten something.
6243021	eng	Tom doesn't know there's still work to do.
6243022	eng	It's become necessary for me to do that.
6243023	eng	I thought Tom didn't enjoy doing that.
6243024	eng	Tom doesn't know that I think he's stupid.
6243025	eng	It'll probably be impossible to do that.
6243026	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be upset by that.
6243027	eng	Tom doesn't know how to speak to children.
6243028	eng	It'll probably be depressing to do that.
6243029	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be in Boston now.
6243030	eng	Tom doesn't know how to play the mandolin.
6243031	eng	It'll be boring if I don't do something.
6243032	eng	I think Tom would have fun doing that.
6243033	eng	Tom doesn't know how much time he'll need.
6243034	eng	It would've been interesting to do that.
6243035	eng	I think Tom would be happy to do that.
6243036	eng	Tom doesn't know how much money was taken.
6243037	eng	It would be unethical for me to do that.
6243038	eng	I think Tom won't be ready to do that.
6243039	eng	Tom doesn't know he's supposed to do that.
6243040	eng	It would be ridiculous to do that again.
6243041	eng	I think Tom won't be here much longer.
6243042	eng	Tom doesn't know any other way to do that.
6243043	eng	It would be nice if you did that for me.
6243044	eng	I think Tom will likely do that later.
6243045	eng	Tom doesn't have the willpower to do that.
6243046	eng	It would be impossible to do that again.
6243047	eng	I think Tom went to Boston last month.
6243048	eng	Tom doesn't have the authority to do that.
6243049	eng	It would be good if you did that for me.
6243050	eng	I think Tom might be a little nervous.
6243051	eng	Tom doesn't have my permission to do that.
6243052	eng	It would be easy to do that by yourself.
6243053	eng	I think Tom is the only Canadian here.
6243054	eng	Tom doesn't have as much patience as I do.
6243055	eng	It would be depressing to do that again.
6243056	eng	I think Tom is considering doing that.
6243057	eng	Tom doesn't get paid very much to do that.
6243058	eng	It would be dangerous for us to do that.
6243059	eng	I think Tom has considered doing that.
6243060	eng	Tom doesn't feel we're helping him enough.
6243061	eng	It would be amazing if we could do that.
6243062	eng	I think Tom did that better this time.
6243063	eng	Tom doesn't ever come to visit us anymore.
6243064	eng	It would be a very good idea to do that.
6243065	eng	I think Tom could pass for a teenager.
6243066	eng	Tom doesn't do that kind of thing anymore.
6243067	eng	It sounds like I didn't have to do that.
6243068	eng	I think Tom could do that if he tried.
6243069	eng	Tom doesn't do that as much as he used to.
6243070	eng	It looks like you're enjoying the party.
6243071	eng	I think I know why Tom had to do that.
6243072	eng	Tom doesn't do much other than read books.
6243073	eng	It looks like you have done that before.
6243074	eng	I think I know why Tom didn't do that.
6243075	eng	Tom does play the saxophone, but not well.
6243076	eng	Is there any chance that you'll do that?
6243077	eng	I think I can do that faster than Tom.
6243078	eng	Tom does almost anything he's asked to do.
6243079	eng	If you do that, it'll cause me problems.
6243080	eng	I still have the umbrella Tom lent me.
6243081	eng	Tom died on the same day his son was born.
6243082	eng	I've seen this happen many times before.
6243083	eng	I shouldn't have told Tom my password.
6243084	eng	Tom died from his wounds three days later.
6243085	eng	I've seen that happen many times before.
6243086	eng	I shouldn't have asked Tom to do that.
6243087	eng	Tom didn't want to do that, but he had to.
6243088	eng	I've given up on the idea of doing that.
6243089	eng	I should've let you talk to Tom first.
6243090	eng	Tom didn't tell us what his last name was.
6243091	eng	I've been trying to eat a balanced diet.
6243093	eng	Tom didn't tell me he intended to do that.
6243094	eng	I've been told to do that several times.
6243095	eng	I should've invited Tom, but I didn't.
6243096	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what he should do.
6243097	eng	I've been charged with attempted murder.
6243098	eng	I should've helped Tom move the couch.
6243099	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what he had to do.
6243100	eng	I've been asked not to help you do that.
6243101	eng	I should've asked Tom why he did that.
6243102	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him.
6243103	eng	I'm wondering whether to do that or not.
6243104	eng	I should tell Tom what he needs to do.
6243105	eng	Tom didn't say what he had planned to say.
6243106	eng	I'm very happy that you did that for me.
6243107	eng	I should tell Tom what has to be done.
6243108	eng	Tom didn't really want to do that, did he?
6243109	eng	I'm too young to get a driver's license.
6243110	eng	I should probably tell Tom to do that.
6243111	eng	Tom didn't really need to do that, did he?
6243112	eng	I'm sure you could do that if you tried.
6243113	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm sleepy.
6243114	eng	Tom didn't really mean to do that, did he?
6243115	eng	I'm sure that I won't forget to do that.
6243116	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm hungry.
6243117	eng	Tom didn't really have to do that, did he?
6243118	eng	I'm sorry, but I can't do that tomorrow.
6243119	eng	I should give Tom a chance to do that.
6243120	eng	Tom didn't know when he needed to do that.
6243121	eng	I'm not the only one who has to do that.
6243123	eng	Tom didn't know that you couldn't do that.
6243124	eng	I'm not the only one allowed to do that.
6243125	eng	I reminded Tom that he had to do that.
6243126	eng	Tom didn't know that he needed to do that.
6243127	eng	I'm going to have to do that eventually.
6243128	eng	I promised to show Tom how to do that.
6243129	eng	Tom didn't know how long he'd been asleep.
6243130	eng	I'm going to Boston tomorrow to do that.
6243131	eng	I often order the same thing Tom does.
6243132	eng	Tom didn't know he didn't need to do that.
6243133	eng	I'm glad that I've never been kidnapped.
6243134	eng	I now know why Tom is still unmarried.
6243135	eng	Tom didn't know he didn't have to do that.
6243136	eng	I'm currently on the board of directors.
6243137	eng	I need to borrow money from Tom again.
6243138	eng	Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
6243139	eng	I'll try to do that as soon as possible.
6243140	eng	I lied to Tom when I said I'd do that.
6243141	eng	Tom didn't even try to get out of the way.
6243142	eng	I'll never be able to do that by myself.
6243143	eng	I know why Tom is supposed to do that.
6243144	eng	Tom didn't do that for me but for himself.
6243145	eng	I'll do that tomorrow and the day after.
6243146	eng	I know why Tom didn't want to do that.
6243147	vie	Không gì tốt bằng không khí trong lành.
6243148	eng	Tom didn't come to French class yesterday.
6243149	eng	I'll be the only one allowed to do that.
6243150	eng	I know that Tom is usually reasonable.
6243151	eng	Tom did that for us for quite a few years.
6243152	eng	I'd like you to do that for me tomorrow.
6243153	eng	I know that Tom is anxious to do that.
6243154	eng	Tom did that even better than we expected.
6243155	eng	I'd like to hear more about your theory.
6243156	eng	I know that Tom hardly ever does that.
6243157	eng	Tom did that about as well as we expected.
6243158	eng	I'd do that for you if you wanted me to.
6243159	eng	I know that Tom doesn't often do that.
6243160	eng	Tom couldn't think of a good hiding place.
6243161	eng	I'd be thankful if you'd let me do that.
6243162	eng	I know I'll need to help Tom tomorrow.
6243163	eng	Tom couldn't stop himself from doing that.
6243164	eng	I'd be thankful if you'd do that for me.
6243165	eng	I knew why Tom wasn't able to do that.
6243166	eng	Tom couldn't do that even if he wanted to.
6243167	eng	I wouldn't do that even if they paid me.
6243168	eng	I knew Tom wasn't planning to do that.
6243169	eng	Tom could've retired, but he chose not to.
6243170	eng	I worried I wouldn't be able to do that.
6243171	eng	I hope that Tom won't do that anymore.
6243172	eng	Tom could've been the last one to do that.
6243173	eng	I wonder if it would be safe to do that.
6243174	eng	I hope Tom won't be afraid to do that.
6243175	eng	Tom could've been excused from doing that.
6243176	eng	I won't need to come so early next time.
6243177	eng	I hope Tom knows who wants to do that.
6243178	eng	Tom could possibly be considered handsome.
6243179	eng	I won't have to come so early next time.
6243180	eng	I hope Tom knows who needs to do that.
6243181	eng	Tom could never do that as well as you do.
6243182	eng	I won't do that, no matter what happens.
6243183	eng	I hope Tom isn't reluctant to do that.
6243184	eng	Tom could get up to three years in prison.
6243185	eng	I wish you wouldn't do that by yourself.
6243186	eng	I hope Tom isn't motivated to do that.
6243187	eng	Tom could get hurt if he tries to do that.
6243188	eng	I wish I'd been tough enough to do that.
6243189	eng	I hope Tom isn't desperate to do that.
6243190	eng	Tom could get hurt if he tried to do that.
6243191	eng	I wish I could understand French better.
6243192	eng	I hope Tom is the next one to do that.
6243193	eng	Tom caught a couple of big fish yesterday.
6243194	eng	I wasn't the one who opened the windows.
6243195	eng	I hope Tom is the last one to do that.
6243196	eng	Tom came close to being run over by a car.
6243197	eng	I wasn't sure if I could do that or not.
6243198	eng	I hope Tom is in Boston all next week.
6243199	eng	Tom calls his mother at least once a week.
6243200	eng	I wasn't aware that I was being watched.
6243201	eng	I hope Tom is forgiven for doing that.
6243202	eng	Tom bought his wife everything she wanted.
6243203	eng	I was told that I don't need to do that.
6243204	eng	I hope Tom is excused from doing that.
6243205	eng	Tom began to do that just a few weeks ago.
6243206	eng	I was told that I don't have to do that.
6243207	eng	I hope Tom doesn't tell us to do that.
6243208	eng	Tom began doing that when he was thirteen.
6243209	eng	I was the only one permitted to do that.
6243210	eng	I helped Tom with his science project.
6243211	eng	Tom backed the car into the parking space.
6243212	eng	I was never given the chance to do that.
6243213	eng	I helped Tom pull weeds in the garden.
6243214	eng	Tom asked me why I hadn't eaten breakfast.
6243215	eng	I was much busier than I thought I'd be.
6243216	eng	I helped Tom pack his things in boxes.
6243217	eng	Tom asked me to come to his house tonight.
6243218	eng	I was at Harvard the same time you were.
6243219	eng	I helped Tom clean up after the party.
6243220	eng	Tom asked me if I wanted to do that today.
6243221	eng	I was afraid of snakes when I was a kid.
6243222	eng	I helped Tom buy everything he needed.
6243223	eng	Tom apologized to us for having done that.
6243224	eng	I was a bartender when I was in college.
6243225	eng	I heard that Tom doesn't do that much.
6243226	eng	Tom and his family visited us last summer.
6243227	eng	I want to try to do that again tomorrow.
6243228	eng	I haven't met either of Tom's parents.
6243229	eng	Tom and a few others were here until 2:30.
6243230	eng	I want to know why you haven't left yet.
6243231	eng	I have no idea why Tom had to do that.
6243232	eng	Tom and I've just gotten back from Boston.
6243233	eng	I want to know what you'd like to drink.
6243234	eng	I had a hard time finding Tom's house.
6243235	eng	Tom and I've been married for three years.
6243236	eng	I want to know how much money you spent.
6243237	eng	I go to the same school that Tom does.
6243238	eng	Tom and I've been discussing that problem.
6243239	eng	I want to have my car painted dark blue.
6243240	eng	I don't want to tell Tom how old I am.
6243241	eng	Tom and I'll be in Boston for three weeks.
6243242	eng	I want to do that, but I don't know how.
6243243	eng	I don't want to live next door to Tom.
6243244	eng	Tom and I'll be getting married next year.
6243245	eng	I want to become a pilot like my father.
6243246	eng	I don't want to let Tom into my house.
6243247	eng	Tom and I worked together on that project.
6243248	eng	I want to be a famous basketball player.
6243249	eng	I don't want to eat the stew Tom made.
6243250	eng	Tom and I went skating together on Monday.
6243251	eng	I used to go to Boston quite frequently.
6243252	eng	I don't want to do what Tom suggested.
6243253	eng	Tom and I went ice skating a few days ago.
6243254	eng	I thought you were supposed to be there.
6243255	eng	I don't want to do that, but Tom does.
6243256	eng	Tom and I wanted to make each other happy.
6243257	eng	I thought I might be allowed to do that.
6243258	eng	I don't want to buy anything from Tom.
6243259	eng	Tom and I wanted to go to Boston together.
6243260	eng	I think that it's not proper to do that.
6243261	eng	I don't want to answer Tom's question.
6243262	eng	Tom and I want to buy a house with a pool.
6243263	eng	I think it's probably unsafe to do that.
6243264	eng	I don't want Tom to do that right now.
6243265	eng	Tom and I walked down the stairs together.
6243266	eng	I think it's little too late to do that.
6243267	eng	I don't think that Tom was having fun.
6243268	eng	Tom and I usually walk to school together.
6243269	eng	I think it might not be wise to do that.
6243270	eng	I don't think that Tom should do that.
6243271	eng	Tom and I used to work in the same office.
6243272	eng	I think it might not be safe to do that.
6243273	eng	I don't think Tom would be interested.
6243274	eng	Tom and I talked about all kinds of stuff.
6243275	eng	I think it might not be easy to do that.
6243276	eng	I don't think Tom will really do that.
6243277	eng	Tom and I study at different universities.
6243278	eng	I think I'd be able to help you do that.
6243279	eng	I don't think Tom will likely do that.
6243280	eng	Tom and I still aren't out of high school.
6243281	eng	I think I can do that without your help.
6243282	eng	I don't think Tom will be sympathetic.
6243283	eng	Tom and I seldom give each other presents.
6243284	eng	I suppose I could go to Boston with you.
6243285	eng	I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
6243286	eng	Tom and I lived in Boston for a long time.
6243287	eng	I started reading this book last Monday.
6243288	eng	I don't think Tom will be discouraged.
6243289	eng	Tom and I like to play badminton together.
6243290	eng	I shouldn't have tried to do that alone.
6243291	eng	I don't think Tom will be cooperative.
6243292	eng	Tom and I have quit talking to each other.
6243293	eng	I should've studied harder for the test.
6243294	eng	I don't think Tom should've done that.
6243295	eng	Tom and I hardly ever speak to each other.
6243296	eng	I should've stayed for a few more hours.
6243297	eng	I don't think Tom needs a new bicycle.
6243298	eng	Tom and I enjoyed ourselves at your party.
6243299	eng	I should've been at yesterday's meeting.
6243300	eng	I don't think Tom is smarter than you.
6243301	eng	Tom and I drank a bottle of wine together.
6243302	eng	I should go ahead and do that by myself.
6243303	eng	I don't think Tom is being reasonable.
6243304	eng	Tom and I don't see each other very often.
6243305	eng	I should be getting ready for the party.
6243306	eng	I don't think Tom enjoyed the concert.
6243307	eng	Tom and I don't like each other very much.
6243308	eng	I should be finished doing that by 2:30.
6243309	eng	I don't really like Tom all that much.
6243310	eng	Tom and I did everything we could to help.
6243311	eng	I really can't come to Boston next week.
6243312	eng	I don't really enjoy singing with Tom.
6243313	eng	Tom and I can't seem to agree on anything.
6243314	eng	I promise that I'll be there in an hour.
6243315	eng	I don't really care how Tom does that.
6243316	eng	Tom and I became engaged three months ago.
6243317	eng	I probably won't go to Boston this year.
6243318	eng	I don't need to do that, but Tom does.
6243319	eng	Tom and I baked three pies this afternoon.
6243320	eng	I never expected this to happen so soon.
6243321	eng	I don't like the way Tom makes coffee.
6243322	eng	Tom and I are thinking of getting married.
6243323	eng	I need to remember to do that on Monday.
6243324	eng	I don't like doing that, but Tom does.
6243325	eng	Tom and I are staying at the Hilton Hotel.
6243326	eng	I might need to go to Boston in October.
6243327	eng	I don't like any of Tom's suggestions.
6243328	eng	Tom and I are getting married next spring.
6243329	eng	I love you more than I love anyone else.
6243330	eng	I don't know why Tom wasn't at school.
6243331	eng	Tom always leaves all his curtains closed.
6243332	eng	I looked at my reflection in the window.
6243333	eng	I don't know why Tom wants to do that.
6243334	eng	Tom almost never goes to places like that.
6243335	eng	I looked at my reflection in the mirror.
6243336	eng	I don't know why Tom needs to do that.
6243337	eng	Tom almost hurt himself trying to do that.
6243338	eng	I learned how to milk a cow last summer.
6243339	eng	I don't know why Tom is so successful.
6243340	eng	Tom almost did that when he was in Boston.
6243341	eng	I learned how to do that just last week.
6243342	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't eat meat.
6243343	eng	Tom almost always laughs at his own jokes.
6243344	eng	I know I'm supposed to do that tomorrow.
6243345	eng	I don't know where Tom's parents live.
6243346	eng	Tom Jackson is one of my favorite authors.
6243347	eng	I knew doing that would be a lot of fun.
6243348	eng	I don't know where Tom went to school.
6243349	eng	Tom, when was it that you went to Boston?
6243351	eng	I don't know where Tom studies French.
6243352	eng	Tom's speech was only three minutes long.
6243353	eng	I hope you don't get injured doing that.
6243354	eng	I don't know where Tom studied French.

6243371	eng	I had no idea that I was being impolite.
6243372	eng	I don't know how much money Tom makes.

6243374	eng	I had a lot of difficulty in doing that.
6243375	eng	I don't have to do that, but Tom does.

6243377	eng	I had a headache, so I couldn't do that.
6243378	eng	I don't eat meat and neither does Tom.

6243380	eng	I guess I should've done that yesterday.

6243418	eng	Tom won't be permitted to do that either.
6243419	eng	I don't understand why I should do that.
6243420	eng	I didn't think that Tom would kiss me.
6243421	eng	Tom won't be difficult to get along with.
6243422	eng	I don't think we really need to do that.
6243423	eng	I didn't think that Tom would do that.
6243424	eng	Tom will wait as long as you tell him to.
6243425	eng	I don't think we really have to do that.

6243431	eng	I don't think that's such a big problem.
6243432	eng	I didn't think Tom would go to Boston.
6243433	eng	Tom will probably be stubborn about that.
6243434	eng	I don't think that what I did was wrong.
6243435	eng	I didn't think Tom would be surprised.
6243436	eng	Tom will probably be sensible about that.
6243437	eng	I don't think it's wise to do that here.
6243438	eng	I didn't think Tom would be impressed.
6243439	eng	Tom will probably be hesitant to do that.

6243455	eng	I don't need to finish doing this today.
6243456	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I wanted to do.

6243558	eng	I didn't want to take that kind of risk.
6243559	eng	I can tell that Tom enjoys doing that.
6243560	eng	Tom told me he'd wait until we got there.
6243561	eng	I didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
6243562	eng	I can do that way better than Tom can.
6243563	eng	Tom thinks that doing that is a bad idea.
6243564	eng	I didn't want to buy a new refrigerator.
6243565	eng	I asked Tom if he wanted to go abroad.
6243566	eng	Tom thinks doing that would be a mistake.
6243567	eng	I didn't want to admit that I was wrong.
6243568	eng	I already know what Tom intends to do.
6243569	eng	Tom surprised all of us when he did that.
6243570	eng	I didn't understand what was being said.
6243571	eng	I advised Tom not to do that too much.
6243572	eng	Tom sure didn't throw the ball very well.
6243573	eng	I didn't think you'd be absent all week.
6243574	eng	How many times a day does Tom do that?
6243575	eng	Tom suggested that we take a short break.
6243576	eng	I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
6243577	eng	How many hours a day does Tom do that?

6243579	eng	I didn't think you would be so careless.
6243580	eng	How many days has Tom been doing that?
6243581	eng	Tom still isn't very good at windsurfing.
6243582	eng	I didn't think that would embarrass you.
6243583	eng	How did you know Tom wouldn't do that?
6243584	eng	Tom still does that as often as possible.
6243585	eng	I didn't think that was going to happen.
6243586	eng	Don't forget to remind Tom to do that.
6243587	eng	Tom started working here on October 20th.
6243588	eng	I didn't think doing that would be safe.
6243589	eng	Do you think Tom would likely do that?
6243590	eng	Tom sprained his left ankle when he fell.
6243591	eng	I didn't think I'd be busy this morning.
6243592	eng	Do you think Tom will need to do that?
6243593	eng	Tom sounds an awful lot like his brother.
6243594	eng	I didn't think I was violating any laws.
6243595	eng	Do you think Tom will have to do that?

6243597	eng	I didn't tell anyone what my plans were.
6243598	eng	Do you think Tom will be enthusiastic?
6243599	eng	Tom sometimes does that when he's sleepy.
6243600	eng	I didn't really need to get up so early.
6243601	eng	Do you think Tom should do that alone?
6243602	vie	Bạn biết anh ấy phải không?
6243603	eng	Tom sometimes does that when he's hungry.
6243604	eng	I didn't really feel like working today.
6243605	eng	Do you think Tom might be sympathetic?
6243606	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that, but he did.
6243607	eng	I didn't mind helping you do the dishes.
6243608	eng	Do you think Tom is afraid to do that?
6243609	eng	Tom should've visited Boston last summer.
6243610	eng	I didn't know your uncle lived with you.
6243611	eng	Do you know why Tom needed to do that?
6243612	eng	Tom should've stayed in Boston last week.
6243613	eng	I didn't know you were going to do that.
6243614	eng	Do you have any idea what Tom will do?
6243615	eng	Tom should've had a little more patience.
6243616	eng	I didn't know who was going to be there.
6243617	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
6243618	eng	Tom should've been in Boston last Monday.
6243619	eng	I didn't know when I needed to be there.
6243620	eng	Didn't you know Tom wasn't happy here?
6243621	eng	Tom should try not to make so much noise.
6243622	eng	I didn't know what was in the briefcase.
6243623	eng	Didn't you know Tom wanted to do that?
6243624	eng	Tom should seriously consider doing that.
6243625	eng	I didn't know that you had so many cats.
6243626	eng	Didn't you know Tom needed to do that?
6243627	eng	Tom should be through doing that by 2:30.
6243628	eng	I didn't know that you couldn't do that.
6243629	eng	Didn't you know Tom is good at French?
6243630	eng	Tom should be present at today's meeting.
6243631	eng	I didn't know that what I did was wrong.
6243632	eng	Did you know that Tom was lying to me?
6243633	eng	Tom should be glad he's not here with us.
6243634	eng	I didn't know I was supposed to do that.
6243635	eng	Did you know that Tom used to do that?
6243636	eng	Tom should be finished doing that by now.
6243637	eng	I didn't have to go to Boston last week.
6243638	eng	Did you know Tom was still doing that?
6243639	eng	Tom should be able to do that on his own.
6243640	eng	I didn't have time, so I didn't do that.
6243641	eng	Did you know Tom was living in Boston?
6243642	eng	Tom seriously has to consider doing that.
6243643	eng	I didn't have time to do that yesterday.
6243644	eng	Did you know Tom was going to be late?
6243645	eng	Tom seems to be aware of what's going on.
6243646	eng	I didn't have the confidence to do that.
6243647	eng	Did you know Tom bought a condominium?
6243648	eng	Tom says the truck is still being loaded.
6243649	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy a car.
6243650	eng	Both of Tom's ex-wives live in Boston.
6243651	eng	Tom says it's little too late to do that.
6243652	eng	I didn't have any idea what I should do.
6243653	eng	Both of Tom's brothers are in custody.
6243654	eng	Tom says he's willing to do that for you.
6243655	eng	I didn't have any difficulty doing that.
6243656	eng	Both of Tom's brothers are doing that.
6243657	eng	Tom says he's waiting for that to happen.
6243658	eng	I didn't have a place to stay in Boston.
6243659	eng	Are you sure Tom is going to be there?
6243660	eng	Tom says he's read that book three times.
6243661	eng	I didn't get to finish what I was doing.
6243662	eng	Are you just going to let Tom do that?
6243663	eng	Tom says he's been beaten up three times.
6243664	eng	I didn't get married until I was thirty.
6243665	eng	An ambulance took Tom to the hospital.
6243666	eng	Tom says he's already decided to do that.
6243667	eng	I didn't feel like doing that yesterday.
6243668	eng	A mutual friend introduced Tom and me.
6243669	eng	Tom says he wouldn't have paid that much.
6243670	eng	I didn't do that because it was raining.
6243671	eng	You've seen Tom do that, haven't you?
6243672	eng	Tom says he won't be in Boston next week.
6243673	eng	I didn't care whether we stayed or left.
6243674	eng	You'll ask Tom to do that, won't you?
6243675	eng	Tom says he wants to continue doing that.
6243676	eng	I didn't buy everything I needed to buy.
6243677	eng	You won't help Tom do that, will you?
6243678	eng	Tom says he tries to do that once a week.
6243679	eng	I couldn't have done that better myself.
6243680	eng	You urged Tom to do that, didn't you?
6243681	eng	Tom says he never wants to do that again.
6243682	eng	I can do that for you if you want me to.
6243683	eng	You told Tom I'd do that, didn't you?
6243684	eng	Tom says he makes thirty dollars an hour.
6243685	eng	I bought this watch at an antique store.
6243686	eng	You thought Tom did that, didn't you?
6243687	eng	Tom says he hopes that you don't do that.
6243688	eng	I bet it's not too difficult to do that.
6243689	eng	You should try to get Tom to do that.
6243690	eng	Tom says he finds doing that interesting.
6243691	eng	I ate dinner at an expensive restaurant.
6243692	eng	You should tell Tom to leave right away.
6243693	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to go to Boston.
6243694	eng	How often are you late for appointments?
6243695	eng	You should probably help Tom do that.
6243696	eng	Tom says he doesn't think that'll happen.
6243697	eng	How many years have you been doing that?
6243698	eng	You should have Tom buy that for you.
6243699	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can do that.
6243700	eng	How many weeks have you been doing that?
6243701	eng	You saw how Tom did that, didn't you?
6243702	eng	Tom says he doesn't like living downtown.
6243703	eng	How many weeks did you spend doing that?
6243704	eng	You need to go to Boston to help Tom.
6243705	eng	Tom says he doesn't have time to do that.
6243706	eng	How many times a week do you go jogging?
6243707	eng	You know you can always count on Tom.
6243708	eng	Tom says he doesn't feel that way at all.
6243709	eng	How many times a day do you drink water?
6243710	eng	You know why Tom did that, don't you?
6243711	eng	Tom says he doesn't feel like doing that.
6243712	eng	How many seconds did it take to do that?
6243713	eng	You expect Tom to do that, don't you?
6243714	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe you did that.
6243715	eng	How many movies did you watch last week?
6243716	eng	You don't think Tom did that, do you?
6243717	eng	Tom says he can't stand people like that.
6243718	eng	How many months will it take to do that?
6243719	eng	You didn't make Tom do that, did you?
6243720	eng	Tom says he always knew he could do that.
6243721	eng	How many months does it take to do that?
6243722	eng	You didn't help Tom do that, did you?
6243723	eng	Tom says he already has plans for Monday.
6243724	eng	How many minutes did it take to do that?
6243725	eng	You dared Tom to do that, didn't you?
6243726	eng	Tom says Boston is a great place to live.
6243727	eng	How many hours have you been doing that?
6243728	eng	You can ask Tom yourself if you want.
6243730	eng	How many days have you spent doing that?
6243731	eng	Would it be OK if Tom didn't do that?
6243733	eng	How many books did you read last summer?
6243734	eng	Won't you please tell Tom to do that?
6243735	eng	Tom sat on a box, looking out the window.
6243736	eng	How long did you have to wait for a bus?
6243737	eng	Will Tom be in Boston on Monday, too?
6243738	eng	Tom sat next to me in church last Sunday.
6243739	eng	How did you know roses were my favorite?
6243740	eng	Why doesn't Tom have to pay anything?
6243741	eng	Tom saluted the flag with his right hand.
6243742	eng	Half of these things are from Australia.
6243743	eng	Why doesn't Tom have to go to Boston?
6243744	eng	Tom said we weren't allowed to swim here.
6243745	eng	Gold is much more expensive than silver.
6243746	eng	Why do you want to break up with Tom?
6243747	eng	Tom said that's not what he wanted to do.
6243748	eng	Even if it rains, I'll do that tomorrow.
6243749	eng	Why didn't you permit Tom to do that?
6243750	eng	Tom said that's not what he needed to do.
6243751	eng	Even if it rains tomorrow, I'll do that.
6243752	eng	Why did Tom say he wanted to do that?
6243753	eng	Tom said that would probably happen soon.
6243754	eng	Don't try to do that when you're sleepy.
6243755	eng	Why did Tom not want to go to Boston?
6243756	eng	Tom said that probably won't happen soon.
6243757	eng	Don't do that again until I tell you to.
6243758	eng	Who told you Tom would be here today?
6243759	eng	Tom said that he'll be back home by 2:30.
6243760	eng	Doctors have been unable to find a cure.
6243761	eng	Who told you Tom was in the hospital?
6243762	eng	Tom said that he wasn't going to do that.
6243763	eng	Do you think you could do that tomorrow?
6243764	eng	Who told you Tom had been doing that?
6243765	eng	Tom said that he was having a lot of fun.
6243766	eng	Do you think it would be fun to do that?
6243767	eng	What'll we do if Tom doesn't do that?
6243768	eng	Tom said it was his first time in Boston.
6243769	eng	Do you think I could do that if I tried?
6243770	eng	What do you think Tom will likely do?
6243771	eng	Tom said his knees hurt most of the time.
6243772	eng	Do you really think you have to do that?
6243773	eng	We expect Tom to do that later today.
6243774	eng	Tom said he's only tried doing that once.
6243775	eng	Do you mind if I don't do that tomorrow?
6243776	eng	There's no way Tom will ever do that.
6243777	eng	Tom said he's only done that three times.
6243778	eng	Do you mean you didn't actually do that?
6243779	eng	There's a doghouse in Tom's backyard.
6243780	eng	Tom said he's been waiting for some time.
6243781	eng	Do you know anyone who's good at French?
6243782	eng	The only one over thirty here is Tom.
6243783	eng	Tom said he's been trying to lose weight.
6243784	eng	Do you have any idea what we need to do?
6243785	eng	That's the reason Tom went to Boston.
6243786	eng	Tom said he's been told to do that again.
6243787	eng	Do you have any idea what we have to do?
6243788	eng	That's the reason Tom didn't do that.
6243789	eng	Tom said he's been having fun doing that.
6243790	eng	Do you buy organically grown vegetables?
6243791	eng	Please tell me when Tom will do that.
6243792	eng	Tom said he's been having fun being here.
6243793	eng	Do I have to have permission to do that?
6243794	eng	Please tell Tom to close the windows.
6243795	eng	Tom said he's always been good at sports.
6243796	eng	Didn't you use to be a student of mine?
6243797	eng	Please tell Tom that I won't do that.
6243798	eng	Tom said he'll help us if we want him to.
6243799	eng	Didn't you use to be a patient of mine?
6243800	eng	Please tell Tom not to do that again.
6243801	eng	Tom said he'll do that as soon as he can.
6243802	eng	Didn't you know that your door was open?
6243803	eng	Please tell Tom he shouldn't do that.
6243804	eng	Tom said he'd help me if I wanted him to.
6243805	eng	Didn't you know I don't have to do that?
6243806	eng	Please make sure Tom doesn't do that.
6243807	eng	Tom said he'd finish doing that tomorrow.
6243808	eng	Did you want me to do something for you?
6243809	eng	Please listen to what Tom has to say.
6243810	eng	Tom said he'd do that if I wanted him to.
6243811	eng	Did you know what you were getting into?
6243812	eng	Please help Tom do that after supper.
6243813	eng	Tom said he'd be the next one to do that.
6243814	eng	Did you know it was possible to do that?
6243815	eng	Perhaps Tom can get a job at the zoo.
6243816	eng	Tom said he'd be the last one to do that.
6243817	eng	Did you know I was going to be arrested?
6243818	eng	My hands are small compared to Tom's.
6243819	eng	Tom said he'd be afraid to do that alone.
6243820	eng	Can you really make a living doing this?
6243821	eng	Maybe we can stay in Boston with Tom.
6243822	eng	Tom said he'd be able to help us do that.
6243823	eng	Both of your rear tires looks a bit low.
6243824	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what happened.
6243825	eng	Tom said he wouldn't do that voluntarily.
6243826	eng	Both of us don't want to work in Boston.
6243827	eng	It's strange that Tom didn't do that.
6243828	eng	Tom said he won't be in Boston next week.
6243829	eng	Both of my sisters died in the accident.
6243830	eng	It's quite possible Tom will do that.
6243831	eng	Tom said he wasn't sure he could do that.
6243832	eng	Aren't you the one who needs to do that?
6243833	eng	It would be nice to do that with Tom.
6243834	eng	Tom said he wasn't a good French speaker.
6243835	eng	Aren't we going go to Boston in October?
6243836	eng	It was insensitive of Tom to do that.
6243837	eng	Tom said he was tired of giving speeches.
6243838	eng	Are you sure we're permitted to do that?
6243839	eng	It took Tom several hours to do that.
6243840	eng	Tom said he was hoping you could do that.
6243841	eng	Are there many movie theaters in Boston?
6243842	eng	It seems that Tom did that yesterday.
6243843	eng	Tom said he was home in bed with the flu.
6243844	eng	Are there any foods that you don't like?
6243845	eng	Is it true that Tom wants to do that?
6243846	eng	Tom said he was happy he got there early.
6243847	eng	Are both of your parents musicians, too?
6243848	eng	Is Tom still living with his parents?
6243849	eng	Tom said he was going to help us do that.
6243850	eng	"Have you done that yet?" "No, not yet."
6243851	eng	Is Tom Jackson one of your employees?
6243852	eng	Tom said he was going to do that himself.
6243853	eng	Your French pronunciation is very good.
6243854	eng	If you do that to Tom, he'll get mad.
6243855	eng	Tom said he wants you to stop doing that.
6243856	eng	You've never seen me do that, have you?
6243857	eng	If it rains tomorrow, Tom won't come.
6243858	eng	Tom said he wanted to do that by himself.
6243859	eng	You're very good at French, aren't you?
6243860	eng	If Tom does that, please let me know.
6243861	eng	Tom said he thought you wouldn't do that.
6243862	eng	You're too sick to do that, aren't you?
6243863	eng	If I were Tom, I'd refuse to do that.
6243864	eng	Tom said he thought it would likely snow.
6243865	eng	You're the only person who can help me.
6243866	eng	I'm the person who does that for Tom.
6243867	eng	Tom said he thought he shouldn't do that.
6243868	eng	You're the only one who has to do that.
6243869	eng	I'm the only person who can help Tom.
6243870	eng	Tom said he thought he needed to do that.
6243871	eng	You're the only one who didn't do that.
6243872	eng	I'm sure that's what Tom wants to do.
6243873	eng	Tom said he thinks he sprained his ankle.
6243874	eng	You're the only one here who has a car.
6243875	eng	I'm sure that's what Tom needs to do.
6243877	eng	You're the most beautiful woman I know.
6243878	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't object to that.
6243879	eng	Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
6243880	eng	You're planning to do that, aren't you?
6243881	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be home on Monday.
6243882	eng	Tom said he plans to be a doctor someday.
6243883	eng	You're not too old to do that, are you?
6243884	eng	I'm sure Tom will do a very nice job.
6243885	eng	Tom said he needed to do that by himself.
6243886	eng	You're hesitant to do that, aren't you?
6243887	eng	I'm sure Tom will be able to help us.
6243888	eng	Tom said he needed to borrow an umbrella.
6243889	eng	You're doing that tomorrow, aren't you?
6243890	eng	I'm sure Tom will be able to do that.
6243891	eng	Tom said he may not study French anymore.
6243892	eng	You're able to do that now, aren't you?
6243894	eng	Tom said he likes the color of my T-shirt.
6243895	eng	You're a very good swimmer, aren't you?
6243896	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't want to be late.
6243897	eng	Tom said he knew he'd be able to do that.
6243898	eng	You're a very fast swimmer, aren't you?
6243899	eng	I'm still willing to do that for Tom.
6243900	eng	Tom said he hasn't decided what he'll do.
6243901	eng	You're a used car salesman, aren't you?
6243902	eng	I'm staying at the same hotel as Tom.
6243903	eng	Tom said he expects to do that on Monday.
6243904	eng	You're a senior at Harvard, aren't you?
6243905	eng	I'm not supposed to help Tom do that.
6243906	eng	Tom said he expects to be there tomorrow.
6243907	eng	You're a college professor, aren't you?
6243908	eng	I'm not supposed to help Tom anymore.
6243909	eng	Tom said he enjoyed the party last night.
6243910	eng	You're a basketball player, aren't you?
6243911	eng	I'll do the same thing that Tom does.
6243912	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
6243914	eng	I'll do that only if Tom tells me to.
6243915	eng	Tom said he doesn't usually lock his car.
6243916	eng	You'll sing with us tonight, won't you?
6243917	eng	I'd never seen Tom that happy before.
6243918	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he can do that.
6243919	eng	You'll never get the chance to do that.
6243920	eng	I write to Tom at least twice a week.
6243921	eng	Tom said he doesn't feel like doing that.
6243922	eng	You'll need to do that sooner or later.
6243923	eng	I wonder who Tom went to Boston with.
6243924	eng	Tom said he didn't want to work overtime.
6243925	eng	You'll have to get a permit to do that.
6243926	eng	I wonder if Tom's daughter is pretty.
6243927	eng	Tom said he didn't want to give a speech.
6243928	eng	You'll have to do that without my help.
6243929	eng	I wonder if Tom knows how to do that.
6243930	eng	Tom said he didn't want to eat leftovers.
6243931	eng	You'll have to do that sooner or later.
6243932	eng	I wonder if Tom has done that before.
6243933	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that again.
6243934	eng	You'll get into trouble if you do that.
6243935	eng	I won't tell Tom what he needs to do.
6243936	eng	Tom said he didn't need to do that today.
6243937	eng	You'll find a way to do that, I'm sure.
6243938	eng	I wish I knew Tom's telephone number.
6243939	eng	Tom said he didn't need to do that again.
6243940	eng	You'd better leave while you still can.
6243941	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom I loved him.
6243942	eng	Tom said he didn't know a thing about it.
6243943	eng	You weren't ready to do that, were you?
6243944	eng	I wish I hadn't played golf with Tom.
6243945	eng	Tom said he didn't have to do that today.
6243946	eng	You were ready to do that, weren't you?
6243947	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to do that.
6243948	eng	Tom said he didn't have to do that again.
6243949	eng	You were eager to do that, weren't you?
6243950	eng	I went to the same school as Tom did.
6243951	eng	Tom said he didn't have anything to read.
6243952	eng	You were asked to do that, weren't you?
6243953	eng	I went to see Tom off at the airport.
6243954	eng	Tom said he didn't have any more details.
6243955	eng	You were a little shocked, weren't you?
6243956	eng	I wasn't surprised that Tom did that.
6243957	eng	Tom said he didn't expect that to happen.
6243958	eng	You usually do that about twice a week.
6243959	eng	I wasn't expecting Tom to help me.
6243960	eng	Tom said he did that as soon as possible.
6243961	eng	You think I want to do that, don't you?
6243962	eng	I wasn't expecting Tom to do that.
6243963	eng	Tom said he couldn't remember doing that.
6243964	eng	You think I need to do that, don't you?
6243965	eng	I wasn't able to tell Tom everything.
6243966	eng	Tom said he could do that in a few hours.
6243967	eng	You think I have to do that, don't you?
6243968	eng	I was there at the same time Tom was.
6243969	eng	Tom said he assumed you wouldn't do that.
6243970	eng	You suggested that we do that together.
6243971	eng	I warned Tom not to do that too much.
6243972	eng	Tom said doing that wouldn't be much fun.
6243973	eng	You still sometimes do that, don't you?
6243974	eng	I wanted to see if Tom could do that.
6243975	eng	Tom said I shouldn't have stayed so long.
6243976	eng	You still do that sometimes, don't you?
6243977	eng	I wanted to go to the dance with Tom.
6243978	eng	Tom refused to tell me where he was born.
6243979	eng	You still do that every day, don't you?
6243980	eng	I wanted to go to the beach with Tom.
6243981	eng	Tom realized he no longer had to do that.
6243982	eng	You shouldn't have done that yesterday.
6243983	eng	I want to know when Tom will do that.
6243984	eng	Tom promised me that he wouldn't be late.
6243985	eng	You shouldn't drink the tap water here.
6243986	eng	I want to know more about Tom's past.
6243987	eng	Tom promised me he'd come, but he didn't.
6243988	eng	You should've done that three days ago.
6243989	eng	I told Tom that I'd do that tomorrow.
6243990	eng	Tom probably won't need to do that again.
6243991	eng	You should've done that somewhere else.
6243992	eng	I told Tom I thought I could do that.
6243993	eng	Tom probably won't have to do that today.
6243994	eng	You should've done that someplace else.
6243995	eng	I told Tom I didn't have any enemies.
6243996	eng	Tom probably won't have to do that again.
6243997	eng	You should never have to do that again.
6243998	eng	I thought you said Tom would do that.
6243999	eng	Tom probably won't be here today, either.
6244000	eng	You should have a good time doing that.
6244001	eng	I thought you said Tom might do that.
6244002	eng	Tom probably just didn't know what to do.
6244003	eng	You should get someone do that for you.
6244004	eng	I thought you said Tom could do that.
6244005	eng	Tom probably hasn't forgotten to do that.
6244006	eng	You should do that as soon as possible.
6244007	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't do that again.
6244008	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why I did that.
6244009	eng	You should be the first one to do that.
6244010	eng	I thought Tom would be in his office.
6244011	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how I did that.
6244012	eng	You seemed to be in a hurry to do that.
6244013	eng	I thought Tom was through doing that.
6244014	eng	Tom probably couldn't do that on his own.
6244015	eng	You seemed to be determined to do that.
6244016	eng	I thought Tom was interested in golf.
6244017	eng	Tom probably couldn't do that by himself.
6244018	eng	You seem to be a fluent French speaker.
6244019	eng	I thought Tom was going to be killed.
6244020	eng	Tom owns several very valuable paintings.
6244021	eng	You promised you wouldn't do that here.
6244022	eng	I thought Tom knew what we had to do.
6244023	eng	Tom only ate potato chips and drank beer.
6244024	eng	You probably could've done that better.
6244025	eng	I thought Tom knew what he had to do.
6244026	eng	Tom often speaks French with his friends.
6244027	eng	You never finished doing that, did you?
6244028	eng	I thought Tom didn't need to do that.
6244029	eng	Tom often goes to the library by bicycle.
6244030	epo	Amon sen amo, oni pagas.
6244031	eng	You need to do that before you go home.
6244032	eng	I thought Tom didn't have to do that.
6244033	eng	Tom often falls asleep while watching TV.
6244034	eng	You need to do that before I get there.
6244035	eng	I thought Tom could probably do that.
6244036	eng	Tom never had the opportunity to do that.
6244037	eng	You must speak French in the classroom.
6244038	eng	I thought Tom could do that tomorrow.
6244039	eng	Tom never expected to be able to do that.
6244040	eng	You may use my computer if you want to.
6244041	eng	I think Tom wouldn't need to do that.
6244042	eng	Tom must've thought he needed to do that.
6244043	eng	You may stay here tonight, if you like.
6244044	eng	I think Tom wouldn't have to do that.
6244045	eng	Tom moved to Boston more than a year ago.
6244046	eng	You may not be able to do that anymore.
6244047	eng	I think Tom would like to be at home.
6244048	eng	Tom might possibly be willing to do that.
6244049	eng	You may need to go to Boston next week.
6244050	eng	I think Tom would be able to do that.
6244051	eng	Tom might not be teaching French anymore.
6244052	eng	You may keep doing that if you want to.
6244053	eng	I think Tom won't be able to do that.
6244054	eng	Tom might not be studying French anymore.
6244055	eng	You may have to go to Boston next week.
6244056	eng	I think Tom will be doing that again.
6244057	eng	Tom might be willing to buy that for you.
6244058	eng	You look like you've been up all night.
6244059	eng	I think Tom will be at home tomorrow.
6244060	eng	Tom might be finished doing that by 2:30.
6244061	eng	You look a lot like your older brother.
6244062	eng	I think Tom was the one who did that.
6244063	eng	Tom may have as many cookies as he wants.
6244064	eng	You look a little bit like your father.
6244065	eng	I think Tom shouldn't have done that.
6244066	eng	Tom may do that right now if he wants to.
6244067	eng	You know I can't go to Boston with you.
6244068	eng	I think Tom really wanted to do that.
6244069	eng	Tom looks as if he's enjoying doing that.
6244070	eng	You have to do that before you go home.
6244071	eng	I think Tom really needed to do that.
6244072	eng	Tom looked like he wasn't in a good mood.
6244073	eng	You have to do that before I get there.
6244074	eng	I think Tom is trying to lose weight.
6244075	eng	Tom looked after my dog for three months.
6244076	eng	You have to do that as soon as you can.
6244077	eng	I think Tom is determined to do that.
6244078	eng	Tom lives with his father and his sister.
6244079	eng	You don't think we can do that, do you?
6244080	eng	I think Tom could end up being fired.
6244081	eng	Tom lit the candles on the birthday cake.
6244082	eng	You don't seem to be afraid to do that.
6244083	eng	I think I'll have to do that for Tom.
6244084	eng	Tom likes living in Boston and I do, too.
6244085	eng	You don't recommend doing that, do you?
6244086	eng	I shouldn't have told Tom everything.
6244087	eng	Tom let me know that he couldn't do that.
6244088	eng	You don't really expect to win, do you?
6244089	eng	I shouldn't have told Tom about that.
6244090	eng	Tom left for his office just before 6:30.
6244091	eng	You don't need to do that until Monday.
6244092	eng	I should've told Tom to visit Boston.
6244093	eng	Tom lay on the sofa with his eyes closed.
6244094	eng	You don't need to be strong to do that.
6244095	eng	I should've shown Tom how to do that.
6244096	eng	Tom knows we weren't supposed to do that.
6244097	eng	You don't have to do that until Monday.
6244098	eng	I should've given Tom what he wanted.
6244099	eng	Tom knows that won't happen anytime soon.
6244100	eng	You don't feel like doing that, do you?
6244101	eng	I should tell Tom what he has to buy.
6244102	eng	Tom knows he's not likely to be punished.
6244103	eng	You don't ever do that anymore, do you?
6244104	eng	I should tell Tom what I want to eat.
6244105	eng	Tom knows he'll never be able to do that.
6244106	eng	You don't believe I'll do that, do you?
6244107	eng	I should tell Tom what I want to buy.
6244108	eng	Tom knew I was supposed to do that today.
6244109	eng	You didn't seem to know how to do that.
6244110	eng	I should tell Tom what I need to buy.
6244111	eng	Tom just ate potato chips and drank beer.
6244112	eng	You didn't seem to be eager to do that.
6244113	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm tired.
6244114	eng	Tom isn't supposed to be able to do that.
6244115	eng	You did that intentionally, didn't you?
6244116	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm sorry.
6244117	eng	Tom isn't likely to be very careful.
6244118	eng	You couldn't do that even if you tried.
6244119	eng	I shared a cell with a guy named Tom.
6244120	eng	Tom isn't likely to be found guilty.
6244121	eng	You can keep doing that if you want to.
6244122	eng	I remember asking Tom not to do that.
6244123	eng	Tom isn't likely be fired for doing that.
6244124	eng	You can do that by yourself, can't you?
6244125	eng	I persuaded Tom not to do that again.
6244126	eng	Tom isn't going to be here for very long.
6244127	eng	You aren't allowed to do that anywhere.
6244128	eng	I need to discuss something with Tom.
6244129	eng	Tom isn't going to be gone for very long.
6244130	eng	Yesterday was your birthday, wasn't it?
6244131	eng	I know that Tom is likely to do that.
6244132	eng	Tom isn't expected to do that by himself.
6244133	eng	Wouldn't it be better to do that today?
6244134	eng	I know that Tom is likely to be late.
6244135	eng	Tom isn't brave enough to try doing that.
6244136	eng	Would you like something cold to drink?
6244137	eng	I know that Tom is afraid to do that.
6244138	eng	Tom isn't as busy today as he usually is.
6244139	eng	Would you be willing to do that for us?
6244140	eng	I know that Tom doesn't speak French.
6244141	eng	Tom is usually the first one to complain.
6244142	eng	Will you work in Boston next year, too?
6244143	eng	I know that Tom doesn't like me much.
6244144	eng	Tom is the smartest kid I've ever taught.
6244145	eng	Will you have time to do that tomorrow?
6244146	eng	I know how much Tom hates doing that.
6244147	eng	Tom is the only one who needs to do that.
6244148	eng	Will I be able to speak at the seminar?
6244149	eng	I know exactly what Tom needs to buy.
6244150	eng	Tom is the only one who likes doing that.
6244151	eng	Why don't you have a permit to do that?
6244152	eng	I know I'm better at French than Tom.
6244153	eng	Tom is the only one permitted to do that.
6244154	eng	Why don't we all go to Boston together?
6244155	eng	I knew Tom might not want to do that.
6244156	eng	Tom is still willing to do that for free.
6244157	eng	Who was the man who did that yesterday?
6244158	eng	I knew Tom might not need to do that.
6244159	eng	Tom is still the best player on our team.
6244160	eng	Who makes the decisions in your family?
6244161	eng	I knew Tom might not have to do that.
6244162	eng	Tom is still reluctant to do that for us.
6244163	eng	Who do you like to spend weekends with?
6244164	eng	I informed Tom that I didn't do that.
6244165	eng	Tom is still able to do that pretty well.
6244166	eng	Who do you like to spend holidays with?
6244167	eng	I hope Tom won't be late again today.
6244168	eng	Tom is someone who never causes problems.
6244169	eng	Who did you want to go with?
6244170	eng	I hope Tom knows what he needs to do.
6244171	eng	Tom is pretty good at everything he does.
6244172	eng	Which of your brothers is the youngest?
6244173	eng	I hope Tom knows he needs to do that.
6244174	eng	Tom is only trying to not get in trouble.
6244175	eng	Where do you want to hang this picture?
6244176	eng	I hope Tom isn't stubborn about that.
6244177	eng	Tom is one of the smartest people I know.
6244178	eng	Where are you going to spend the night?
6244179	eng	I hope Tom isn't in Boston next week.
6244180	eng	Tom is older than the other participants.
6244181	eng	When I call your name, raise your hand.
6244182	eng	I hope Tom isn't hesitant to do that.
6244183	eng	Tom is now the president of this company.
6244184	eng	What kind of food do you like the most?
6244185	eng	I hope Tom is easy to get along with.
6244186	eng	Tom is now serving a three-year sentence.
6244187	eng	What do you think we should about that?
6244188	eng	I hope Tom doesn't refuse to do that.
6244189	eng	Tom is much smarter than you think he is.
6244190	eng	What did you do the Monday before last?
6244191	eng	I hope Tom doesn't ask us to do that.
6244192	eng	Tom is lucky to still be able to do that.
6244193	eng	What countries would you like to visit?
6244194	eng	I helped Tom decide which hat to buy.
6244195	eng	Tom is lucky that he was able to do that.
6244197	eng	I heard that Tom is going to do that.
6244198	eng	Tom is likely to still be doing that now.
6244199	eng	What color clothes do you usually wear?
6244200	eng	I have to help Tom clean up his room.
6244201	eng	Tom is likely to be reluctant to do that.
6244202	eng	Weren't you going to do that yesterday?
6244203	eng	I had no idea that Tom would do that.
6244204	eng	Tom is likely to be motivated to do that.
6244205	eng	We've studied French for several years.
6244206	eng	I forgot to send Tom a birthday card.
6244207	eng	Tom is likely to be desperate to do that.
6244208	eng	We've been working since three o'clock.
6244209	eng	I don't want to go swimming with Tom.
6244210	eng	Tom is likely to be charged with perjury.
6244211	eng	We've been told not to do that anymore.
6244212	eng	I don't want to buy anything for Tom.
6244214	eng	We're running a little behind schedule.
6244215	eng	I don't want the present Tom gave me.
6244217	eng	We're not allowed to speak French here.
6244218	eng	I don't want anything to do with Tom.
6244219	eng	Tom is in the bathroom washing his hands.
6244220	eng	We're going to go to Boston in October.
6244221	eng	I don't want Tom to worry about that.
6244222	eng	Tom is good at giving clear explanations.
6244223	eng	We're going to be in Boston next month.
6244224	eng	I don't want Tom to think I'm a wimp.
6244225	eng	Tom is good at almost everything he does.
6244226	eng	We won't get paid extra for doing that.
6244227	eng	I don't want Tom to think I'm a jerk.
6244228	eng	Tom is going to be very sad if you leave.
6244229	eng	We were only permitted to do that once.
6244230	eng	I don't want Tom to help you do that.
6244231	eng	Tom is feeling a little bit better today.
6244232	eng	We were just about to start doing that.
6244233	eng	I don't want Tom to come to my party.
6244234	eng	Tom is a very good heavy metal guitarist.
6244235	eng	We should've gone to Boston last month.
6244236	eng	I don't want Tom to become a soldier.
6244237	eng	Tom is a good person to have on our side.
6244238	eng	We should wait until Monday to do that.
6244239	eng	I don't think that Tom would do that.
6244240	eng	Tom hurt himself while trying to do that.
6244241	eng	We only have one year to get this done.
6244242	eng	I don't think that Tom is having fun.
6244243	eng	Tom hasn't told me why he has to do that.
6244244	eng	We need to come up with some new ideas.
6244245	eng	I don't think Tom would've said that.
6244246	eng	Tom hasn't performed live in a long time.
6244247	eng	We might visit Boston on our next trip.
6244248	eng	I don't think Tom would ever do that.
6244249	eng	Tom hasn't made any money in three years.
6244250	eng	We might have to be in Boston all week.
6244251	eng	I don't think Tom would be impressed.
6244252	eng	Tom hasn't done that in a very long time.
6244253	eng	We have to do that as soon as possible.
6244254	eng	I don't think Tom will be suspicious.
6244255	eng	Tom has worked as a carpenter since 2013.
6244256	eng	We had to come to Boston for a funeral.
6244257	eng	I don't think Tom will be reasonable.
6244258	eng	Tom has told me not to do that by myself.
6244259	eng	We don't think the fire was deliberate.
6244260	eng	I don't think Tom will be interested.
6244261	eng	Tom has told me he won't do that anymore.
6244262	eng	We don't often see monkeys around here.
6244263	eng	I don't think Tom will be frightened.
6244264	eng	Tom has told me he wants to write a book.
6244265	eng	We don't often get a chance to do that.
6244266	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that.
6244267	eng	Tom has told me he wants to go to Boston.
6244268	eng	We didn't live in Boston for very long.
6244269	eng	I don't think Tom knows how to drive.
6244270	eng	Tom has told me he needs to go to Boston.
6244271	eng	We didn't know each other at that time.
6244272	eng	I don't think Tom is going to resign.
6244273	eng	Tom has studied French for several years.
6244274	eng	We decided to speak together in French.
6244275	eng	I don't think Tom is being sarcastic.
6244276	eng	Tom has rewritten the first thirty pages.
6244277	eng	We can pitch our tent anywhere we want.
6244278	eng	I don't think Tom is being realistic.
6244279	eng	Tom has released three albums since 2013.
6244280	eng	We bought a house for 300,000 dollars.
6244281	eng	I don't think Tom is able to do that.
6244282	eng	Tom has proven that he can still do that.
6244283	eng	We both were in Boston all last summer.
6244285	eng	Tom has now been missing for thirty days.
6244286	eng	Was it you who was supposed to do that?
6244287	eng	I don't think Tom could've done that.
6244288	eng	Tom has never refused any of my requests.
6244289	eng	Was it you who forgot to lock the door?
6244290	eng	I don't think Tom could ever do that.
6244291	eng	Tom has his faults, but I still like him.
6244292	eng	To was probably tired when he got home.
6244293	eng	I don't think I'm as creative as Tom.
6244294	eng	Tom has half again as many books as I do.
6244295	eng	Three of my students were absent today.
6244296	eng	I don't remember what Tom looks like.
6244297	eng	Tom has had a lot of practice doing that.
6244298	eng	Three of my students didn't come today.
6244299	eng	I don't remember asking Tom for help.
6244300	eng	Tom has found a solution to that problem.
6244301	eng	This restaurant opened on October 20th.
6244302	eng	I don't really think Tom can do that.
6244303	eng	Tom has finally decided to call it quits.
6244304	eng	This morning's meeting was interesting.
6244305	eng	I don't really expect Tom to do that.
6244306	eng	Tom has done a lot of really good things.
6244307	eng	This isn't what we should be doing now.
6244308	eng	I don't like playing tennis with Tom.
6244309	eng	Tom has decided to do something about it.
6244310	eng	This isn't a good time to buy platinum.
6244311	eng	I don't like Tom, but I like his dog.
6244312	eng	Tom has been told that he has to do that.
6244313	eng	This is the best season for doing that.
6244314	eng	I don't know why Tom let you do that.
6244315	eng	Tom has been told not to do that anymore.
6244316	eng	They don't pay me very much to do that.
6244317	eng	I don't know why Tom kept doing that.
6244318	eng	Tom has been to every one of my concerts.
6244319	eng	There's still time to change your mind.
6244320	eng	I don't know why Tom isn't at school.
6244321	eng	Tom has been painting his house all week.
6244322	eng	There's just no way that I can do that.
6244323	eng	I don't know why Tom is scared of me.
6244324	eng	Tom has been on the job for three months.
6244325	eng	The past three days have been very hot.
6244326	eng	I don't know why Tom is afraid of me.
6244327	eng	Tom has been in the garden pulling weeds.
6244328	eng	The meeting only lasted thirty minutes.
6244329	eng	I don't know why Tom is absent today.
6244330	eng	Tom has been in Boston a couple of weeks.
6244331	eng	That's the man whose wife was arrested.
6244332	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't like me.
6244333	eng	Tom has been here for almost three years.
6244334	eng	That was a very innovative thing to do.
6244335	eng	I don't know who's going to help Tom.
6244336	eng	Tom has been having a hard time speaking.
6244337	eng	That isn't wine. It's only grape juice.
6244338	eng	I don't know who Tom's girlfriend is.
6244339	eng	Tom has been diagnosed with brain cancer.
6244340	eng	That isn't wine. It's just grape juice.
6244341	eng	I don't know where Tom wants to live.
6244342	eng	Tom has been collecting stamps for years.
6244343	eng	That almost sounds too good to be true.
6244344	eng	I don't know what Tom's shoe size is.
6244345	eng	Tom has been caught cheating three times.
6244346	eng	Someone must've left the door unlocked.
6244347	eng	I don't know what Tom wants me to do.
6244348	eng	Tom has been a French teacher since 2013.
6244349	eng	Please wait until next week to do that.
6244350	eng	I don't know what Tom put in the box.
6244351	eng	Tom has already taught me how to do that.
6244352	eng	Please check and see if we may do that.
6244353	eng	I don't know what Tom is going to do.
6244354	eng	Tom has admitted he was there that night.
6244355	eng	Please check and see if we can do that.
6244356	eng	I don't know what I'd do without Tom.

6244358	eng	Perhaps I won't be busy this afternoon.
6244359	eng	I don't know the girl talking to Tom.
6244360	eng	Tom has a very special way of doing that.
6244361	eng	People around here don't often do that.
6244362	eng	I don't know if Tom will come or not.
6244363	eng	Tom hardly ever goes to places like that.
6244364	eng	Our driveway is slippery when it's wet.
6244365	eng	I don't know exactly where Tom lives.
6244366	eng	Tom had a lot of things he wanted to buy.
6244367	eng	My youngest daughter isn't married yet.
6244368	eng	I don't expect Tom to object to that.
6244369	eng	Tom had a lot of things he needed to buy.
6244370	eng	My wife will pick me up at the airport.
6244371	eng	I don't do that as often as Tom does.
6244372	eng	Tom grew up on a farm not too far Boston.
6244373	eng	My wife and I were both born in Boston.
6244374	eng	I don't care if Tom does that or not.
6244375	eng	Tom graduates from high school on Monday.
6244376	eng	My priorities aren't the same as yours.
6244377	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom everything.
6244378	eng	Tom got a very low score on today's test.
6244379	eng	My priorities are different from yours.
6244380	eng	I didn't want to go camping with Tom.

6244385	eng	My name doesn't seem to be on the list.
6244386	eng	I didn't want to do that without Tom.
6244387	eng	Tom expected us do the same thing he did.
6244388	eng	My mouth was full so I couldn't answer.
6244389	eng	I didn't want to talk to Tom about work.
6244390	eng	Tom eventually decided to try doing that.
6244391	eng	My mother said that I should come home.
6244392	eng	I didn't want Tom to stay any longer.
6244393	eng	Tom doesn't want to try to do that again.

6244401	eng	I didn't want Tom to know I was rich.
6244402	eng	Tom doesn't want to be in Boston anymore.
6244403	eng	My computer is a lot better than yours.
6244404	eng	I didn't want Tom to help me do that.
6244405	eng	Tom doesn't usually do that after dinner.
6244406	eng	My car is three years older than yours.
6244407	eng	I didn't think Tom would get injured.
6244408	eng	Tom doesn't think you'd enjoy doing that.
6244409	eng	Mr. Jackson was my third grade teacher.
6244410	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so upset.
6244411	eng	Tom doesn't think that we should do that.
6244412	eng	Mary may be cute, but I don't like her.
6244413	eng	I didn't think Tom would be punctual.
6244414	eng	Tom doesn't think that he should do that.
6244415	eng	Many people have complained about that.
6244416	eng	I didn't think Tom wanted to do that.
6244417	eng	Tom doesn't think I'm allowed to do that.
6244418	eng	It's going to be very tough to do that.
6244419	eng	I didn't think Tom needed to do that.
6244420	eng	Tom doesn't think I can do that, does he?
6244421	eng	It'll take me several hours to do that.
6244422	eng	I didn't think Tom knew how to drive.
6244423	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be afraid to do that.
6244424	eng	It'll probably be expensive to do that.
6244425	eng	I didn't think that Tom would be late.
6244426	eng	Tom doesn't seem like an intelligent man.
6244427	eng	It'll probably be dangerous to do that.
6244428	eng	I didn't tell Tom why we should come.
6244429	eng	Tom doesn't see why he shouldn't do that.
6244430	eng	It'll cause me problems if you do that.
6244431	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he should buy.
6244432	eng	Tom doesn't really need to do that today.
6244433	eng	It'll be easier if we do that together.
6244434	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he has to buy.
6244435	eng	Tom doesn't really have to do that today.
6244436	eng	It would've been ridiculous to do that.
6244437	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he had to buy.
6244438	eng	Tom doesn't really care how he does that.
6244439	eng	It would've been impossible to do that.
6244440	eng	I didn't tell Tom what happened next.
6244441	eng	Tom doesn't particularly want to do that.
6244442	eng	It would've been depressing to do that.
6244443	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I have to buy.
6244444	eng	Tom doesn't often show his true feelings.
6244445	eng	It would be ridiculous to do that here.
6244446	eng	I didn't tell Tom that you'd be here.
6244447	eng	Tom doesn't often do that in the morning.
6244448	eng	It would be great if you could do that.
6244449	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I was leaving.
6244450	eng	Tom doesn't like beef and I don't either.
6244451	eng	It would be dangerous to do that again.
6244452	eng	I didn't tell Tom how big my dog was.
6244453	eng	Tom doesn't know who's going to help him.
6244454	eng	It sounds like I don't need to do that.
6244455	eng	I didn't tell Tom anything about you.
6244456	eng	Tom doesn't know what you're looking for.
6244457	eng	It sounds like I don't have to do that.
6244458	eng	I didn't tell Tom about the accident.
6244459	eng	Tom doesn't know what I'm planning to do.
6244460	eng	It probably won't cost much to do that.
6244461	eng	I didn't tell Tom I wouldn't do that.
6244462	eng	Tom doesn't know that won't happen today.
6244463	eng	Is there anything else you need to say?
6244464	eng	I didn't tell Tom I knew his brother.
6244465	eng	Tom doesn't know if he'll do that or not.
6244466	eng	Is the book you're reading interesting?
6244467	eng	I didn't offer Tom anything to drink.
6244468	eng	Tom doesn't know how to get a hold of me.
6244469	eng	If you're tired, I can do that for you.
6244470	eng	I didn't notice what Tom was wearing.
6244471	eng	Tom doesn't know how to do that, does he?
6244472	eng	If you don't hurry, we'll miss the bus.
6244473	eng	I didn't notice what Tom was reading.
6244474	eng	Tom doesn't know he has to do that today.
6244475	eng	If I were you, I wouldn't go to Boston.
6244476	eng	I didn't laugh at any of Tom's jokes.
6244477	eng	Tom doesn't intend to ever do that again.
6244478	eng	If I had enough money, I could do that.
6244479	eng	I didn't know where Tom wanted to go.
6244480	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that until Monday.
6244481	eng	I've never felt like doing that before.
6244482	eng	I didn't know what Tom's problem was.
6244483	eng	Tom doesn't have those kinds of problems.
6244484	eng	I've loved you since we were both kids.
6244485	eng	I didn't know what Tom wanted to eat.
6244486	eng	Tom doesn't have the strength to do that.
6244487	eng	I've been waiting for over three hours.
6244488	eng	I didn't know what Tom wanted to buy.
6244489	eng	Tom doesn't have the patience to do that.
6244490	eng	I've been playing chess for many years.
6244491	eng	I didn't know that Tom would do that.
6244492	eng	Tom doesn't have as much patience as you.
6244493	eng	I've been out of work for three months.
6244494	eng	I didn't know that Tom would be here.
6244495	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends his own age.
6244496	eng	I've been asked not to do that anymore.
6244497	eng	I didn't know that Tom was in Boston.
6244498	eng	Tom doesn't even want to do that anymore.
6244499	vie	Tom tới nhờ bọn mình giúp.
6244500	eng	I've always been pretty good at sports.
6244501	eng	I didn't know that Tom was a teacher.
6244502	eng	Tom doesn't doubt his ability to do that.
6244503	eng	I'm the person you've been looking for.
6244504	eng	I didn't know that Tom liked to cook.
6244505	eng	Tom does that three or four times a week.
6244506	eng	I'm still planning to buy that for you.
6244507	eng	I didn't know that Tom had done that.
6244508	eng	Tom does know how to do that, doesn't he?
6244509	eng	I'm still not very good at windsurfing.
6244510	eng	I didn't know that Tom had been sick.
6244511	eng	Tom does almost nothing he's asked to do.
6244512	eng	I'm really glad I was asked to do that.
6244513	eng	I didn't know Tom was your boyfriend.
6244514	eng	Tom didn't tell me why he needed my help.
6244515	eng	I'm positive that'll happen eventually.
6244516	eng	I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
6244517	eng	Tom didn't tell me why he had to do that.
6244518	eng	I'm not the only one here who's single.
6244519	eng	I didn't keep my promise to help Tom.
6244520	eng	Tom didn't tell me that I had to do that.
6244521	eng	I'm not afraid to get my clothes dirty.
6244522	eng	I didn't hear Tom come into the room.
6244523	eng	Tom didn't seem to be having a good time.
6244524	eng	I'm likely to go to Boston in the fall.
6244525	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom, but I did.
6244526	eng	Tom didn't seem to be enjoying the party.
6244527	eng	I'm having my house painted next month.
6244528	eng	I didn't have to tell Tom what to do.
6244529	eng	Tom didn't notice that I got my hair cut.
6244530	eng	I'm going to paint my house next month.
6244531	eng	I didn't have anything to say to Tom.
6244532	eng	Tom didn't know that I wanted to do that.
6244533	eng	I'm going to have to do that by myself.
6244534	eng	I didn't have any idea where Tom was.
6244535	eng	Tom didn't know that I needed to do that.
6244536	eng	I'm going to fly to Boston next Monday.
6244537	eng	I didn't go and Tom didn't go either.
6244538	eng	Tom didn't know how much money he needed.
6244539	eng	I'm going to come to Boston in October.
6244540	eng	I didn't do what Tom wanted me to do.
6244541	eng	Tom didn't have the authority to do that.
6244542	eng	I'm glad that I learned how to do that.
6244543	eng	I didn't discuss the matter with Tom.
6244544	eng	Tom didn't expect you to do that for him.
6244545	eng	I'm glad I was able to do that for you.
6244546	eng	I didn't buy what Tom told me to buy.
6244547	eng	Tom didn't expect to be here for so long.
6244548	eng	I'm doing my French homework right now.
6244550	eng	Tom didn't even apologize for doing that.
6244551	eng	I'm certain that I'll do that tomorrow.
6244552	eng	I did exactly the same thing Tom did.
6244553	eng	Tom did exactly what we wanted him to do.
6244554	eng	I'm absolutely sure that's what I need.
6244555	eng	I can tell that Tom likes doing that.
6244556	eng	Tom did exactly what he said he would do.
6244557	eng	I'm a lot happier since I changed jobs.
6244558	eng	I already know what Tom's opinion is.
6244559	eng	Tom did everything he was supposed to do.
6244560	eng	I'll do that tomorrow or the day after.
6244561	eng	How did you know Tom didn't eat meat?
6244562	eng	Tom definitely wants to do that with you.
6244563	eng	I'd rather do that today than tomorrow.
6244564	eng	How did Tom sprain his ankle?
6244565	eng	Tom dedicated his first book to his wife.
6244566	eng	I'd like to buy three of those scarves.
6244567	eng	Everyone stayed in Boston except Tom.
6244568	eng	Tom decided to try doing that by himself.
6244569	eng	I'd like about three kilograms of potatoes.
6244570	eng	Even Tom doesn't know how to do that.
6244571	eng	Tom decided he wouldn't worry about that.
6244572	eng	I'd hoped I'd be able to do that today.
6244573	eng	Don't expect Tom to buy that for you.
6244574	eng	Tom currently resides in the Boston area.
6244575	eng	I'd hoped I could learn how to do that.
6244576	eng	Doesn't Tom go to Boston every month?
6244577	eng	Tom crouched down so he wouldn't be seen.
6244578	eng	I'd be grateful if you did that for me.
6244579	eng	Does Tom need to stay in Boston, too?
6244580	eng	Tom couldn't swim when he was a teenager.
6244581	eng	I'd already planned to do that for you.
6244582	eng	Do you want me to get Tom to do that?
6244583	eng	Tom could've done that if he'd wanted to.
6244584	eng	I write much better now than I used to.
6244585	eng	Do you think Tom will be cooperative?
6244586	eng	Tom could've done that faster by himself.
6244587	eng	I wouldn't do that today if I were you.
6244588	eng	Do you think Tom was able to do that?
6244589	eng	Tom could get in trouble if he does that.
6244590	eng	I wouldn't do that if I didn't have to.
6244591	eng	Do you think Tom might be suspicious?
6244592	eng	Tom could easily have stopped doing that.
6244593	eng	I wouldn't do that even if I were rich.
6244594	eng	Do you think Tom might be here later?
6244595	eng	Tom could do that well when he was young.
6244596	eng	I wonder if it would be fun to do that.
6244597	eng	Do you think Tom is ready to do that?
6244598	eng	Tom could do that if he really wanted to.
6244599	eng	I won't be coming to Boston this month.
6244600	eng	Do you know what street Tom lives on?
6244601	eng	Tom could be the boss if he wanted to be.
6244602	eng	I wish I'd been rich enough to do that.
6244603	eng	Do you and Tom still hate each other?
6244604	eng	Tom could be lying, but I don't think so.
6244605	eng	I wish I hadn't spanked my son so hard.
6244606	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was unhappy?
6244607	eng	Tom could always do that if he wanted to.
6244608	eng	I wish I hadn't left the door unlocked.
6244609	eng	Didn't you know Tom wouldn't do that?
6244610	eng	Tom correctly answered all the questions.
6244611	eng	I wasn't good enough to be on the team.
6244612	eng	Didn't you know Tom was unhappy here?
6244613	eng	Tom comes here every Monday without fail.
6244614	eng	I was thirty minutes late this morning.
6244615	eng	Didn't you know Tom was still single?
6244616	eng	Tom can't speak either French or English.
6244617	eng	I was on a business trip all last week.
6244618	eng	Didn't you know Tom lived by himself?
6244619	eng	Tom can't afford to buy the car he wants.
6244620	eng	I was hoping you'd be more cooperative.
6244621	eng	Didn't you know Tom likes doing that?
6244622	eng	Tom can have as many cookies as he wants.
6244623	eng	I was hoping you could do that with me.
6244624	eng	Didn't you know Tom liked to do that?
6244625	eng	Tom can do that right now if he wants to.
6244626	eng	I was annoyed by the sounds of traffic.
6244627	eng	Didn't you know Tom liked doing that?
6244628	eng	Tom can always try doing that by himself.
6244629	eng	I wanted to surprise you by doing that.
6244630	eng	Didn't you know Tom had a sports car?
6244631	eng	Tom bought an acre of land near the lake.
6244632	eng	I wanted to go home earlier than usual.
6244634	eng	Tom baked this bread yesterday afternoon.
6244635	eng	I want to talk to you later about that.
6244636	eng	Did you tell Tom when he should come?
6244637	eng	Tom ate a couple of sandwiches for lunch.
6244638	eng	I want to pay back the money I owe you.
6244639	eng	Did you know that Tom would be there?
6244640	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to go swimming.
6244641	eng	I want to know when you're coming home.
6244642	eng	Did you know that Tom isn't Canadian?
6244643	eng	Tom asked me to teach him how to do that.
6244644	eng	I want to know when you'll be finished.
6244645	eng	Did you know Tom was still in prison?
6244646	eng	Tom asked me to give him time to do that.
6244647	eng	I want to know when you'll be arriving.
6244648	eng	Did you know Tom liked horror movies?
6244649	eng	Tom asked if he really needed to do that.
6244650	eng	I want to know if you like my new song.
6244651	eng	Did you know Tom knew how to do that?
6244652	eng	Tom and his family visit us every summer.
6244653	eng	I want to know how much beer you drank.
6244654	eng	Did you know Tom had a swimming pool?
6244655	eng	Tom and I've known each other since 2013.
6244656	eng	I want to hear both sides of the story.
6244657	eng	Can you tell me exactly what Tom did?
6244658	eng	Tom and I've decided to do that together.
6244659	eng	I want to eat some chocolate ice cream.
6244660	eng	Both of Tom's brothers were arrested.
6244661	eng	Tom and I were the first ones to do that.
6244662	eng	I want to avoid doing that if possible.
6244663	eng	Are you sure Tom is ready to do that?
6244664	eng	Tom and I were neighbors for three years.
6244665	eng	I try to help whoever asks me for help.
6244666	eng	All of Tom's children became doctors.
6244667	eng	Tom and I were neighbors for a few years.
6244668	eng	I thought you wouldn't want to do that.
6244669	eng	You're the one Tom wants to talk to.
6244670	eng	Tom and I were always fighting back then.
6244671	eng	I thought you weren't going to do that.
6244672	eng	You won't do that for Tom, will you?
6244673	eng	Tom and I want to know what your plan is.
6244674	eng	I thought you said you'd never do that.
6244675	eng	You were lucky Tom did that for you.
6244676	eng	Tom and I used to be pretty good friends.
6244677	eng	I thought you said I needed to do that.
6244678	eng	You shouldn't permit Tom to do that.
6244679	eng	Tom and I talked about what we should do.
6244680	eng	I thought you didn't have a girlfriend.
6244681	eng	You should tell Tom you can do that.
6244682	eng	Tom and I talked about what had happened.
6244683	eng	I thought I'd be able to do that today.
6244684	eng	You should let Tom do what he wants.
6244685	eng	Tom and I spent Valentine's Day together.
6244686	eng	I thought I heard my name being called.
6244687	eng	You should let Tom buy that for you.
6244688	eng	Tom and I played soccer together as kids.
6244689	eng	I think you might need help doing that.
6244690	eng	You should ask Tom buy that for you.
6244691	eng	Tom and I played chess for several hours.
6244692	eng	I think we'll be able to do that today.
6244693	eng	You promised you'd help Tom do that.
6244694	eng	Tom and I plan to get married in October.
6244695	eng	I think it's probably cheap to do that.
6244696	eng	You need to tell Tom not to do that.
6244697	eng	Tom and I never did like each other much.
6244698	eng	I think it'll be impossible to do that.
6244699	eng	You look quite a bit older than Tom.
6244700	eng	Tom and I have been married thirty years.
6244701	eng	I think it would be foolish to do that.
6244702	eng	You know what Tom can do, don't you?
6244703	eng	Tom and I get along well with each other.
6244704	eng	I think it might be foolish to do that.
6244705	eng	You have to tell Tom not to do that.
6244706	eng	Tom and I exchange gifts every Christmas.
6244707	eng	I think doing that would be worthwhile.
6244708	eng	You have to show Tom how to do that.
6244709	eng	Tom and I enjoyed singing songs together.
6244710	eng	I think I might be required to do that.
6244711	eng	You didn't let Tom do that, did you?
6244712	eng	Tom and I don't very often work together.
6244713	eng	I still haven't paid last month's rent.
6244714	eng	You didn't do that for Tom, did you?
6244715	eng	Tom and I don't often do things together.
6244717	eng	Would Tom be able to do that for us?
6244718	eng	Tom and I don't do that together anymore.
6244719	eng	I still haven't learned how to do that.
6244720	eng	Why does Tom need to be there early?
6244721	eng	Tom and I don't always do the same thing.
6244722	eng	I shouldn't have walked home by myself.
6244723	eng	Why didn't Tom want to go to Boston?
6244724	eng	Tom and I ate the whole pie by ourselves.
6244725	eng	I shouldn't have left the windows open.
6244726	eng	Why didn't Tom need to go to Boston?
6244727	eng	Tom and I are planning to move to Boston.
6244728	eng	I should've told you about that sooner.
6244729	eng	Why didn't Tom have to pay anything?
6244730	eng	Tom and I are not talking to one another.
6244731	eng	I should've left when I had the chance.
6244732	eng	Why didn't Tom have to go to Boston?
6244733	eng	Tom and I are no longer living in Boston.
6244734	eng	I should've been in Boston last Monday.
6244735	eng	Why can't Tom go to Boston with you?
6244736	eng	Tom and I are here to help you with that.
6244737	eng	I should be through doing that by 2:30.
6244738	eng	When was it that Tom went to Boston?
6244739	eng	Tom and I are going camping this weekend.
6244740	eng	I should be there in a couple of hours.
6244741	eng	When is Tom coming back from Boston?
6244742	eng	Tom and I are always arguing about money.
6244743	eng	I said that I didn't understand French.
6244744	eng	What time will Tom do that tomorrow?
6244745	eng	Tom and I are almost finished doing that.
6244746	eng	I regret that I can't help you do that.
6244748	eng	Tom always sits at the head of the table.
6244749	eng	I really want to stay in Boston longer.
6244750	eng	What do you think Tom would've done?
6244751	eng	Tom almost never gives his wife presents.
6244752	eng	I really don't think I need to do that.
6244753	eng	What did Tom do yesterday afternoon?
6244754	eng	Tom almost always does that after dinner.
6244755	eng	I pretended I didn't understand French.
6244756	eng	What Tom did never made sense to me.
6244757	eng	Tom, weren't you going to do that today?
6244758	eng	I often need to be reminded to do that.
6244759	eng	We need to go to Boston to help Tom.
6244760	eng	Tom's teeth have always been that color.
6244761	eng	I often have to be reminded to do that.
6244762	eng	We have to take Tom to the hospital.
6244763	eng	Tom's funeral will be on Monday at 2:30.
6244764	eng	I never thought I'd be able to do that.
6244765	eng	This is the factory where Tom works.
6244766	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me who he'd talked to.
6244767	eng	I never had the opportunity to do that.
6244768	eng	The only French speaker here is Tom.
6244769	eng	Tom would've wanted to do that with you.
6244770	eng	I never expected to be able to do that.
6244771	eng	The old TV Tom gave me doesn't work.
6244772	eng	Tom would never have done that that way.
6244773	eng	I need to do that before I can go home.
6244774	eng	The man wearing the blue tie is Tom.
6244775	eng	Tom would like to know why you did that.
6244776	eng	I might have to go to Boston next week.
6244777	eng	Tell Tom he needs to get here early.
6244778	eng	Tom would like to know how you did that.
6244779	eng	I might be willing to buy that for you.
6244780	eng	Shouldn't we be helping Tom do that?
6244781	eng	Tom would like to do that, but he can't.
6244782	eng	I may have to visit Boston next Monday.
6244783	eng	Shouldn't Tom be the one doing that?
6244784	eng	Tom would get in trouble if he did that.
6244785	eng	I looked around, but didn't see anyone.
6244786	eng	Please tell Tom not to do that here.
6244787	eng	Tom would be very happy if you did that.
6244788	eng	I know why I'm not supposed to do that.
6244789	eng	Please tell Tom he ought to do that.
6244790	eng	Tom won't permit you to do that anymore.
6244791	eng	I know a very effective way to do that.
6244792	eng	Please tell Tom he needs to do that.
6244793	eng	Tom won't likely try to do that anymore.
6244794	eng	I know I'll be able to do that by 2:30.
6244795	eng	Perhaps Tom is doing that right now.
6244796	eng	Tom won't likely be hesitant to do that.
6244797	eng	I know I'd do that if I had the chance.
6244798	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't do that anymore.
6244799	eng	Tom won't be present at today's meeting.
6244800	eng	I know I should've done that yesterday.
6244801	eng	Perhaps I can go to Boston with Tom.
6244802	eng	Tom won't be permitted to do that again.
6244803	eng	I know I don't need to do that anymore.
6244804	eng	My injuries weren't as bad as Tom's.
6244805	eng	Tom will unlikely have to do that today.
6244806	eng	I know I don't have to do that anymore.
6244807	eng	Let's go over to Tom's and help him.
6244808	eng	Tom will probably go to Boston tomorrow.
6244809	eng	I knew it would be possible to do that.
6244810	eng	Let Tom listen to whatever he wants.
6244811	eng	Tom will probably do that tomorrow, too.
6244812	eng	I just stayed in Boston for three days.
6244813	eng	Let Tom listen to anything he wants.
6244814	eng	Tom will probably be too shy to do that.
6244815	eng	I just can't imagine myself doing that.
6244816	eng	It's doubtful that Tom will do that.
6244817	eng	Tom will probably be through doing that.
6244818	eng	I hope you're able to come to my party.
6244819	eng	It'll take Tom long time to do that.
6244820	eng	Tom will probably be tempted to do that.
6244821	eng	I hope I get a chance to do that again.
6244822	eng	It would be safe for Tom to do that.
6244823	eng	Tom will probably be furious about that.
6244824	eng	I heard that you've started doing that.
6244825	eng	It takes courage to do what Tom did.
6244826	eng	Tom will probably be anxious to do that.
6244827	eng	I haven't yet filed a formal complaint.
6244828	eng	It sounds like Tom wants to do that.
6244829	eng	Tom will move back to Boston in October.
6244831	eng	It sounds like Tom needs to do that.
6244832	eng	Tom will likely be reluctant to do that.
6244833	eng	I haven't washed my car in a long time.
6244834	eng	It seems that only Tom will do that.
6244835	eng	Tom will likely be motivated to do that.
6244836	eng	I have no objection to your doing that.
6244837	eng	It seems like Tom enjoys doing that.
6244838	eng	Tom will likely be gone for three hours.
6244839	eng	I have a special tool I use to do that.
6244840	eng	It seemed like Tom liked to do that.
6244841	eng	Tom will likely be fired for doing that.
6244842	eng	I hardly ever do that before breakfast.
6244843	eng	It seemed like Tom liked doing that.
6244844	eng	Tom will likely be fined for doing that.
6244845	eng	I found that in the back of the closet.
6244846	eng	It probably wasn't Tom who did that.
6244847	eng	Tom will likely be desperate to do that.
6244848	eng	I figured this would happen eventually.
6244849	eng	Is Tom the only one who can do that?
6244850	eng	Tom will likely be back by October 20th.
6244851	eng	I felt the same way you did about that.
6244852	eng	Is Tom still able to do that for us?
6244853	eng	Tom will keep doing that if he wants to.
6244854	eng	I felt somebody tap me on the shoulder.
6244855	eng	Is Tom going to sing for us tonight?
6244856	eng	Tom will do whatever he can to help you.
6244857	eng	I expected you to do the same thing I did.
6244858	eng	If you do that, Tom will be pleased.
6244859	eng	Tom will do that tomorrow, too, I think.
6244860	eng	I doubt that you'll be able to do that.
6244861	eng	If would be good for Tom to do that.
6244862	eng	Tom will be working in Boston on Monday.
6244863	eng	I doubt if it would be safe to do that.
6244864	eng	I've seen Tom do that several times.
6244865	eng	Tom will be leaving Boston this morning.
6244866	eng	I don't want you to buy any more candy.
6244867	eng	I've persuaded Tom to do that again.
6244868	eng	Tom will be here later today to do that.
6244869	eng	I don't want to talk about my problems.
6244870	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be interested.
6244871	eng	Tom will be fired if he does that again.
6244872	eng	I don't want to take that kind of risk.
6244873	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be in Boston now.
6244874	eng	Tom will be fined if he does that again.
6244875	eng	I don't want to live like this anymore.
6244876	eng	I'm sure Tom will be home on Monday.
6244877	eng	Tom will be exhausted when he gets home.
6244878	eng	I don't want to live in Boston anymore.
6244879	eng	I'm looking forward to visiting Tom.
6244880	eng	Tom will be difficult to get along with.
6244881	eng	I don't want to give any more speeches.
6244882	eng	I'll ask Tom if he wants to do that.
6244883	eng	Tom will be back the day after tomorrow.
6244884	eng	I don't want to eat at that restaurant.
6244885	eng	I'd be reluctant to do that for Tom.
6244886	eng	Tom wasn't the worst player on our team.
6244887	eng	I don't want to eat Mexican food today.
6244888	eng	I'd be disappointed if Tom did that.
6244889	eng	Tom was tired, but he wouldn't admit it.
6244890	eng	I don't want to be seen talking to you.
6244891	eng	I would never permit Tom to do that.
6244892	eng	Tom was the only person who was injured.
6244893	eng	I don't usually do that when I'm tired.
6244894	eng	I wonder whether Tom has to do that.
6244895	eng	Tom was the only one who had to do that.
6244896	eng	I don't think you'd be able to do that.
6244897	eng	I wonder if Tom was able to do that.
6244898	eng	Tom was the only one who didn't do that.
6244899	eng	I don't think that it'll rain tomorrow.
6244900	eng	I won't permit Tom to do that again.
6244901	eng	Tom was the only one allowed to do that.
6244902	eng	I don't think it's wise to do that now.
6244903	eng	I won't do that unless Tom helps me.
6244904	eng	Tom was the one who gave me this guitar.
6244905	eng	I don't think it's too late to do that.
6244906	eng	I won't be able to make Tom do that.
6244907	eng	Tom was the one who filed the complaint.
6244908	eng	I don't think doing that would be safe.
6244909	eng	I wish Tom wouldn't do that anymore.
6244910	eng	Tom was the first one to try to help me.
6244911	eng	I don't think doing that would be rude.
6244912	vie	Cô ta gây sự rồi đánh anh ấy.
6244913	eng	I wish Tom would tell me what to do.
6244914	eng	Tom was the first one to try to do that.
6244915	eng	I don't think anything bad will happen.
6244916	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom to do that.
6244917	eng	Tom was just trying to protect his kids.
6244918	eng	I don't think I've ever eaten dog meat.
6244919	eng	I wish I hadn't seen Tom doing that.
6244920	eng	Tom was hoping we could do that for him.
6244921	eng	I don't think I'm ready to do that yet.
6244922	eng	I wish I hadn't gone to Tom's party.
6244923	eng	Tom was doing that just a few hours ago.
6244924	eng	I don't think I'm permitted to do that.
6244925	eng	I wish I hadn't gone there with Tom.
6244926	eng	Tom was apparently in Boston last month.
6244927	eng	I don't think I'll be doing that again.
6244928	eng	I wish I hadn't given Tom any money.
6244929	eng	Tom warned us not to swim in this river.
6244930	eng	I don't think I'd ever want to do that.
6244931	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me.
6244932	eng	Tom wants to surprise you by doing that.
6244933	eng	I don't think I should do that anymore.
6244934	eng	I wasn't sure what Tom wanted to do.
6244935	eng	Tom wants to be the next one to do that.
6244936	eng	I don't think I really need to do that.
6244937	eng	I wasn't sure what Tom needed to do.
6244938	eng	Tom wants to be the last one to do that.
6244939	eng	I don't think I really have to do that.
6244940	eng	I wasn't sure Tom needed to do that.
6244941	eng	Tom wants to be excused from doing that.
6244942	eng	I don't think I can ever be happy here.
6244943	eng	I wasn't able to get Tom to do that.
6244944	eng	Tom usually eats lunch at Chuck's Diner.
6244945	eng	I don't remember turning off the stove.
6244946	eng	I was tempted to tell Tom the truth.
6244947	eng	Tom usually does that when he's nervous.
6244948	eng	I don't remember exactly what happened.
6244949	eng	I want to know why Tom is mad at me.
6244950	eng	Tom usually does that about once a week.
6244951	eng	I don't really think I need to do that.
6244952	eng	I want to have lunch with Tom today.
6244953	eng	Tom used to say that to me all the time.
6244954	eng	I don't really think I have to do that.
6244955	eng	I visited Tom last spring in Boston.
6244956	eng	Tom used to have a house on Park Street.
6244957	eng	I don't really feel like working today.

6244959	eng	Tom used to do that when he was younger.
6244960	eng	I don't play golf as much as I used to.
6244961	eng	I told Tom I wanted to go to Boston.
6244962	eng	Tom used to come to Boston every summer.
6244963	eng	I don't often do that in the afternoon.
6244964	eng	I told Tom I didn't have to do that.
6244965	eng	Tom tried speaking French to the waiter.
6244966	eng	I don't need to go to Boston next week.
6244967	eng	I told Tom I didn't have much money.
6244968	eng	Tom told us he wouldn't do that anymore.
6244969	eng	I don't need to do this, but I want to.
6244970	eng	I thought Tom would want to do that.
6244971	eng	Tom told me you weren't able to do that.
6244972	eng	I don't need to buy anything right now.
6244973	eng	I thought Tom would stop doing that.
6244974	eng	Tom told me that my plan was reasonable.
6244975	eng	I don't need to be back until tomorrow.
6244976	eng	I thought Tom would quit doing that.
6244977	eng	Tom told me that he's afraid to do that.
6244978	eng	I don't need money to have a good time.
6244979	eng	I thought Tom was likely to do that.
6244980	eng	Tom told me that he'll do that tomorrow.
6244981	eng	I don't need any of this stuff anymore.
6244982	eng	I thought Tom was going to be fired.
6244983	eng	Tom told me that he'd be home on Monday.
6244984	eng	I don't need any help with my homework.
6244985	eng	I thought Tom was flirting with you.
6244986	eng	Tom told me it would be safe to do that.
6244987	eng	I don't mind if you do that without me.
6244988	eng	I thought Tom might want to do that.
6244989	eng	Tom told me he'd wait for us until 2:30.
6244990	eng	I don't live within Boston city limits.
6244991	eng	I thought Tom might need to do that.
6244992	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't do that anymore.

6244998	eng	Tom told me he likes this kind of music.
6244999	eng	I don't like girls who wear high heels.
6245000	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be sympathetic.
6245001	eng	Tom told me he liked this kind of music.
6245002	eng	I don't know whether to do that or not.
6245003	eng	I think Tom would regret doing that.
6245004	eng	Tom told me he didn't intend to do that.
6245005	eng	I don't know what kind of snake bit me.
6245006	eng	I think Tom would refuse to do that.
6245007	eng	Tom told me I shouldn't wait any longer.
6245008	eng	I don't know what it's like to be poor.
6245010	eng	Tom thought he would be able to do that.
6245011	eng	I don't know if I have time to do that.
6245012	eng	I think Tom would be miserable here.
6245013	eng	Tom thought he could do that by himself.
6245014	eng	I don't know how to solve this problem.
6245015	eng	I think Tom won't be home on Monday.
6245016	eng	Tom thinks some of his friends did that.
6245017	eng	I don't know how to say this in French.
6245018	eng	I think Tom will be doing that soon.
6245019	eng	Tom swam until he couldn't swim anymore.
6245020	eng	I don't know how much money was stolen.

6245023	eng	I don't know exactly what I need to do.
6245024	eng	I think Tom will be able to do that.
6245025	eng	Tom studies much harder now than before.
6245026	eng	I don't know exactly what I have to do.
6245027	eng	I think Tom really wants to do that.

6245032	eng	I don't have to go to Boston next week.
6245033	eng	I think Tom is reluctant to do that.
6245034	eng	Tom still manages to do that quite well.
6245035	eng	I don't have to do this, but I want to.
6245036	eng	I think Tom is motivated to do that.

6245071	eng	I don't get invited to parties anymore.
6245072	eng	I shouldn't have borrowed Tom's car.
6245073	eng	Tom sometimes falls asleep during class.

6245099	eng	I should tell Tom I want to do that.
6245100	eng	Tom should've hit the dog with his shoe.
6245101	eng	I didn't want to do that, but I had to.
6245102	eng	I should probably tell Tom I'm busy.
6245103	eng	Tom should've done that a long time ago.
6245104	eng	I didn't want to cross the picket line.
6245105	eng	I should help Tom with his homework.
6245106	eng	Tom should've bought something to drink.
6245107	eng	I didn't want my friends to see me cry.
6245108	eng	I should do what Tom asked me to do.
6245109	eng	Tom should've been safe in his own home.
6245110	eng	I didn't think we'd be able to do that.
6245111	eng	I should ask Tom to help me do that.
6245112	eng	Tom should've been reluctant to do that.
6245113	eng	I didn't think we should be doing that.
6245114	eng	I really enjoy hanging out with Tom.
6245115	eng	Tom should've been ready, but he wasn't.
6245116	eng	I didn't think that Mary was beautiful.
6245117	eng	I often eat the same thing Tom does.
6245118	eng	Tom should've been motivated to do that.
6245119	eng	I didn't think I'd be busy all day.
6245120	eng	I need to stay and help Tom do that.
6245121	eng	Tom should wait until Monday to do that.
6245122	eng	I didn't take many pictures on my trip.
6245123	eng	I need to do what Tom told me to do.
6245124	eng	Tom should try not to make things worse.
6245125	eng	I didn't specify exactly what I wanted.
6245126	eng	I might be able to buy that for Tom.
6245127	eng	Tom should be through doing that by now.
6245128	eng	I didn't recognize anyone in the photo.
6245129	eng	I looked at Tom and he looked at me.
6245130	eng	Tom served almost three years in prison.
6245131	eng	I didn't really need to do that, did I?
6245132	eng	I know where Tom will be doing that.
6245133	eng	Tom seems to be having such a good time.
6245134	eng	I didn't really have to do that, did I?
6245135	eng	I know that Tom's house is for sale.
6245136	eng	Tom seems to be doing that all the time.
6245137	eng	I didn't really feel like going skiing.
6245138	eng	I know that Tom won't be doing that.
6245139	eng	Tom seems to be doing that a lot lately.
6245140	eng	I didn't realize my socks didn't match.
6245141	eng	I know that Tom is eager to do that.
6245142	eng	Tom seemed to know what he needed to do.
6245143	eng	I didn't notice that the door was open.
6245144	eng	I know exactly what Tom needs to do.
6245145	eng	Tom seemed to enjoy reading comic books.
6245146	eng	I didn't need to leave in such a hurry.
6245147	eng	I know Tom was just being sarcastic.
6245148	eng	Tom says that's his favorite restaurant.
6245149	eng	I didn't mean to cause you any trouble.
6245150	eng	I know Tom shouldn't have done that.
6245151	eng	Tom says that he didn't want to do that.
6245152	eng	I didn't know who was going to help me.
6245153	eng	I know Tom came to Boston last week.
6245154	eng	Tom says it's really cold in Boston now.
6245156	eng	I hope Tom will soon be better.
6245157	eng	Tom says he's willing to do that for me.
6245158	eng	I didn't know what was really going on.
6245159	eng	I hope that Tom won't do that again.
6245160	eng	Tom says he's ready to get back to work.
6245161	eng	I didn't know what was going to happen.
6245162	eng	I hope that Tom will do that for me.
6245163	eng	Tom says he's grown tired of doing that.
6245164	eng	I didn't know what was about to happen.
6245165	eng	I hope Tom won't want me to do that.
6245166	eng	Tom says he's good at riding a unicycle.
6245167	eng	I didn't know what else I needed to do.
6245168	eng	I hope Tom won't tell me to do that.
6245169	eng	Tom says he's even done janitorial work.
6245170	eng	I didn't know this was going to happen.
6245171	eng	I hope Tom knows who has to do that.
6245172	eng	Tom says he's been arrested three times.
6245173	eng	I didn't know that you were so unhappy.
6245174	eng	I hope Tom isn't tempted to do that.
6245175	eng	Tom says he'd rather do that by himself.
6245176	eng	I didn't know that was going to happen.
6245177	eng	I hope Tom isn't at today's meeting.
6245178	eng	Tom says he doesn't think you'd do that.
6245179	eng	I didn't know that horses cost so much.
6245180	eng	I hope Tom is in Boston next Monday.
6245181	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he'll do that.
6245182	eng	I didn't know that I'd be here all day.
6245183	eng	I hope Tom is determined to do that.
6245184	eng	Tom says he doesn't need to do that now.
6245185	eng	I didn't know that I needed to do that.
6245186	eng	I hope Tom doesn't end up in prison.
6245187	eng	Tom says he doesn't have to do that now.
6245188	eng	I didn't know how to solve the problem.
6245189	eng	I helped Tom out by singing harmony.
6245190	eng	Tom says he definitely wants to do that.
6245191	eng	I didn't know I shouldn't do that here.
6245192	eng	I heard that Tom did that yesterday.
6245193	eng	Tom said your snoring didn't bother him.
6245194	eng	I didn't know I didn't need to do that.
6245195	eng	I have to stay and help Tom do that.
6245196	eng	Tom said yesterday's meeting was boring.
6245197	eng	I didn't know I didn't have to do that.
6245198	eng	I have no idea what Tom is thinking.
6245199	eng	Tom said we wouldn't be able to do that.
6245200	eng	I didn't have enough time to eat lunch.
6245201	eng	I go to the same school as Tom does.
6245202	eng	Tom said we ought to do this more often.
6245203	eng	I didn't have enough money to buy that.
6245204	eng	I expected Tom to do that yesterday.
6245205	eng	Tom said there were no plans to do that.
6245206	eng	I didn't have enough energy to do that.
6245207	eng	I expected Tom to do that on Monday.
6245208	eng	Tom said the storm lasted several hours.
6245209	eng	I didn't have anything to do with that.
6245210	eng	I expect Tom to do that later today.
6245211	eng	Tom said that's not what he wants to do.
6245212	eng	I didn't have a good time at the party.
6245213	eng	I doubt if Tom will do that anymore.
6245214	eng	Tom said that's not what he needs to do.
6245215	eng	I didn't get home until after midnight.
6245216	eng	I doubt Tom will ever do that again.
6245217	eng	Tom said that's not even partially true.
6245218	eng	I didn't expect to be here for so long.
6245219	eng	I don't want to tell Tom everything.
6245220	eng	Tom said that's his favorite restaurant.
6245221	eng	I didn't expect this to happen so soon.
6245222	eng	I don't want to drive Tom's old car.
6245223	eng	Tom said that would likely never happen.
6245224	eng	I didn't expect the test to be so easy.
6245225	eng	I don't want to do that without Tom.
6245226	eng	Tom said that it probably wouldn't snow.
6245227	eng	I didn't even want to think about that.
6245228	eng	I don't want talk to Tom about work.
6245229	eng	Tom said that it probably wouldn't rain.
6245230	eng	I didn't eat anything until I got home.
6245231	eng	I don't want Tom to swim by himself.
6245232	eng	Tom said that he's been very happy here.
6245233	eng	I didn't come to work by bicycle today.
6245234	eng	I don't want Tom to stay any longer.
6245235	eng	Tom said that he'd be back home by 2:30.
6245236	eng	I didn't attend this morning's meeting.
6245237	eng	I don't want Tom to leave the house.
6245238	eng	Tom said that he wouldn't swim tomorrow.
6245239	eng	I didn't arrive until just before 2:30.
6245240	eng	I don't want Tom to know about that.
6245241	eng	Tom said that he wouldn't do that again.
6245242	eng	I did everything I thought I should do.
6245243	eng	I don't want Tom to do that anymore.
6245244	eng	Tom said that he would do that tomorrow.
6245245	eng	I did everything I thought I needed to do.
6245246	eng	I don't think that Tom is in Boston.
6245247	eng	Tom said that he won't do that tomorrow.
6245248	eng	I did everything I thought I had to do.
6245249	eng	I don't think that Tom is a plumber.
6245250	eng	Tom said that he wasn't working anymore.
6245251	eng	I could get hurt if I tried doing that.
6245252	eng	I don't think Tom will be surprised.
6245253	eng	Tom said that he wasn't married anymore.
6245254	eng	I can't speak either French or English.
6245255	eng	I don't think Tom will be in Boston.
6245256	eng	Tom said some things would never change.
6245257	eng	I can't leave Boston until next Monday.
6245258	eng	I don't think Tom will be back soon.
6245259	eng	Tom said not doing that isn't an option.
6245260	eng	I can't go to Boston with you tomorrow.
6245261	eng	I don't think Tom wanted to do that.
6245262	eng	Tom said no injuries have been reported.
6245263	eng	I bought this watch at an antique shop.
6245264	eng	I don't think Tom needed to do that.
6245265	eng	Tom said it was snowing in Boston today.
6245266	eng	I borrowed this umbrella from a friend.
6245267	eng	I don't think Tom is careful enough.
6245268	eng	Tom said it was harder than he expected.
6245269	eng	I ate three apples yesterday afternoon.
6245270	eng	I don't think Tom has done that yet.
6245271	eng	Tom said it was easier than he expected.
6245272	eng	I assumed you wouldn't want to do that.
6245273	eng	I don't think Tom does that anymore.
6245274	eng	Tom said it rained in Boston last night.
6245275	eng	I asked you not to smoke in the office.
6245276	eng	I don't plan to go to Tom's concert.
6245277	eng	Tom said his license had been suspended.
6245278	eng	I also lived in Boston for three years.
6245279	eng	I don't need to tell Tom what to do.
6245280	eng	Tom said his father told him to do that.
6245281	eng	How many years will it take to do that?
6245282	eng	I don't need Tom to do that anymore.
6245283	eng	Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
6245284	eng	How many women over thirty do you know?
6245285	eng	I don't like the way Tom makes stew.
6245286	eng	Tom said he's willing to do that for me.
6245287	eng	How many weeks will it take to do that?
6245288	eng	I don't like swimming, but Tom does.
6245289	eng	Tom said he's unenthusiastic about that.
6245290	eng	How many weeks does it take to do that?
6245291	eng	I don't like broccoli, but Tom does.
6245292	eng	Tom said he's troubled by what happened.
6245293	eng	How many rooms are on the second floor?
6245294	eng	I don't know why Tom was doing that.
6245295	eng	Tom said he's never considered retiring.
6245296	eng	How many patients do you see in a week?
6245297	eng	I don't know why Tom should do that.
6245298	eng	Tom said he's been trying to be careful.
6245299	eng	How many pages have you written so far?
6245300	eng	I don't know why Tom is ignoring me.
6245301	eng	Tom said he's been asked not to do that.
6245302	eng	How many pages did you read last night?
6245303	eng	I don't know why Tom has to do that.
6245304	eng	Tom said he's amused by what's going on.
6245305	eng	How many months did you stay in Boston?
6245306	eng	I don't know why Tom had to do that.
6245307	eng	Tom said he'll be on vacation next week.
6245308	eng	How many months did it take to do that?
6245309	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't do that.
6245310	eng	Tom said he'll be in Boston next Monday.
6245311	eng	How many hours will it take to do that?
6245312	eng	I don't know where Tom will do that.
6245313	eng	Tom said he'd rather you didn't do that.
6245314	eng	How many hours does it take to do that?
6245315	eng	I don't know where Tom wants to eat.
6245316	eng	Tom said he'd never consider doing that.
6245317	eng	How many days have you been doing that?
6245318	eng	I don't know where Tom used to work.
6245319	eng	Tom said he'd like to keep working here.
6245320	eng	How many days did you spend doing that?
6245321	eng	I don't know where Tom is right now.
6245322	eng	Tom said he'd help us if we want him to.
6245323	eng	How long will you be staying in Boston?
6245324	eng	I don't know when Tom's birthday is.
6245325	eng	Tom said he'd do that as soon as he can.
6245326	eng	How long do you intend to be in Boston?
6245327	eng	I don't know what to feed Tom's dog.
6245328	eng	Tom said he'd be embarrassed to do that.
6245329	eng	How long do you expect to be in Boston?
6245330	eng	I don't know what time Tom got home.
6245331	eng	Tom said he wouldn't ever do that again.
6245332	eng	How far is it to the station from here?
6245333	eng	I don't know if Tom likes me or not.
6245334	eng	Tom said he wouldn't attend the meeting.
6245335	eng	How do you think we should handle this?
6245336	eng	I don't know if Tom is happy or not.
6245337	eng	Tom said he wished you wouldn't do that.
6245338	eng	How did you know what you needed to do?
6245339	eng	I don't know how good a cook Tom is.
6245340	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't gone there.
6245341	eng	How did you know what time to be there?
6245342	eng	I don't know Tom's telephone number.
6245343	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't eaten that.
6245344	eng	How did you know what else I had to do?
6245345	eng	I don't have to tell Tom what to do.
6245346	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't drunk that.
6245347	eng	Have you ever been to a surprise party?
6245348	eng	I don't doubt that Tom will do that.
6245349	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't been there.
6245350	eng	Have I done something I shouldn't have?
6245351	eng	I don't care who Tom does that with.
6245352	eng	Tom said he wasn't the least bit hungry.
6245353	eng	French is the language I want to learn.
6245354	eng	I don't care how much money Tom has.
6245355	eng	Tom said he wasn't permitted to do that.
6245356	eng	Even though it's snowing, I'll do that.
6245357	eng	I don't blame Tom for what happened.
6245358	eng	Tom said he was trying to be optimistic.
6245359	eng	Even though it was raining, I did that.
6245360	eng	I don't blame Tom for getting angry.
6245361	eng	Tom said he was good at speaking French.
6245362	eng	Don't try to do that without some help.
6245363	eng	I don't believe Tom really did that.
6245364	eng	Tom said he was going to take that risk.
6245365	eng	Don't try to do that when you're tired.
6245366	eng	I didn't want Tom to move to Boston.
6245367	eng	Tom said he was going to do that for me.
6245368	eng	Don't try to do that when you're drunk.
6245369	eng	I didn't want Tom to do that for me.
6245370	eng	Tom said he was going to do that anyway.
6245371	eng	Don't forget to kiss your wife goodbye.
6245372	eng	I didn't want Tom to come to Boston.
6245373	eng	Tom said he was almost ready to do that.
6245374	eng	Don't eat or drink anything else today.
6245375	eng	I didn't understand what Tom wanted.
6245376	eng	Tom said he was afraid to do that alone.
6245377	eng	Doing that's illegal in many countries.
6245378	eng	I didn't think Tom's joke was funny.
6245379	eng	Tom said he wants to do that by himself.
6245380	eng	Doing that would probably be dangerous.
6245381	eng	I didn't think Tom would talk to me.
6245382	eng	Tom said he wanted to leave early today.
6245383	eng	Doing that would be a good thing to do.
6245384	eng	I didn't think Tom would be worried.
6245385	eng	Tom said he tried to do that by himself.
6245386	eng	Doing that probably won't be dangerous.
6245387	eng	I didn't think Tom would be nervous.
6245388	eng	Tom said he thought I was very annoying.
6245389	eng	Doing that likely won't be interesting.
6245390	eng	I didn't think Tom would be jealous.
6245391	eng	Tom said he sold his house for $300,000.
6245392	eng	Doing that is likely to be very boring.
6245393	eng	I didn't tell Tom who my father was.
6245394	eng	Tom said he really doesn't do that much.
6245395	eng	Doing that here will be very expensive.
6245396	eng	I didn't tell Tom where I was going.
6245397	eng	Tom said he never wanted this to happen.
6245398	eng	Do you think you'd be quiet doing that?
6245399	eng	I didn't tell Tom what was going on.
6245400	eng	Tom said he never wanted that to happen.
6245401	eng	Do you think you'd be happy doing that?
6245402	eng	I didn't tell Tom what might happen.
6245403	eng	Tom said he never considered doing that.
6245404	eng	Do you think it's dangerous to do that?
6245405	eng	I didn't tell Tom what he has to do.
6245406	eng	Tom said he needs to do that by himself.
6245407	eng	Do you still go swimming every weekend?
6245408	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I had to buy.
6245409	eng	Tom said he needs to borrow an umbrella.
6245410	eng	Do you remember what time you did that?
6245411	eng	I didn't tell Tom I lived in Boston.
6245412	eng	Tom said he needed to borrow some money.
6245413	eng	Do you know whose sunglasses these are?
6245414	eng	I didn't sit around waiting for Tom.
6245415	eng	Tom said he hopes to be back in October.
6245416	eng	Do you have any idea what we should do?
6245417	eng	I didn't realize that Tom was lying.
6245418	eng	Tom said he hoped to be back in October.
6245419	eng	Do you always lock your house at night?
6245420	eng	I didn't realize Tom should do that.
6245421	eng	Tom said he hoped he could win the race.
6245422	eng	Do I need to get permission to do that?
6245423	eng	I didn't realize Tom had to do that.
6245424	eng	Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
6245425	eng	Didn't you know that I used to do that?
6245426	eng	I didn't notice what Tom was eating.
6245427	eng	Tom said he has to learn how to do that.
6245428	eng	Did you stay in Boston all last summer?
6245429	eng	I didn't notice how Tom was dressed.
6245430	eng	Tom said he had to learn how to do that.
6245431	eng	Did both of your parents go to college?
6245432	eng	I didn't let Tom go out in the rain.
6245433	eng	Tom said he got really tired doing that.
6245434	eng	Did I translate the sentence correctly?
6245435	eng	I didn't know where Tom's house was.
6245436	eng	Tom said he doesn't remember doing that.
6245437	eng	Could you stop by my office after 2:30?
6245438	eng	I didn't know what Tom was thinking.
6245439	eng	Tom said he doesn't know how to do that.
6245440	eng	Could you give me a couple of examples?
6245441	eng	I didn't know what Tom wanted to do.
6245442	eng	Tom said he didn't want to sing with us.
6245443	eng	Chuck's Diner is now open for business.
6245444	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't happy.
6245445	eng	Tom said he didn't want to mow the lawn.
6245446	eng	Chuck's Diner has gone out of business.
6245447	eng	I didn't know that Tom was a doctor.
6245448	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that here.
6245449	eng	Both of your legs need to be amputated.
6245450	eng	I didn't know that Tom had children.
6245451	eng	Tom said he didn't recommend doing that.
6245452	eng	Both of my brothers have been arrested.
6245453	eng	I didn't know that Tom could see me.
6245454	eng	Tom said he didn't have anything to eat.
6245455	eng	Are you going to do that tomorrow, too?
6245456	eng	I didn't know how to respond to Tom.
6245457	eng	Tom said he didn't have a place to stay.
6245458	eng	Are you confident that you can do that?
6245459	eng	I didn't know Tom was your grandson.
6245460	eng	Tom said he appreciated you being there.
6245461	eng	Are we going to stay in Boston tonight?
6245462	eng	I didn't know Tom wanted to do that.
6245463	eng	Tom said doing that was never an option.
6245464	eng	Am I the only one who wants to do that?
6245465	eng	I didn't know Tom shouldn't do that.
6245466	eng	Tom said I was the one with the problem.
6245467	eng	Am I the only one who needs to do that?
6245468	eng	I didn't know Tom needed to do that.
6245469	eng	Tom said I should've helped him do that.
6245470	eng	All three of us overslept this morning.
6245471	eng	I didn't give Tom what he asked for.
6245472	eng	Tom said I didn't sound very optimistic.
6245473	eng	All the walls in my house need painted.
6245474	eng	I didn't expect to hear Tom's voice.
6245475	eng	Tom refused to do what I told him to do.
6245476	eng	About what time will you be doing that?
6245477	eng	I didn't expect Tom to be so hungry.
6245478	eng	Tom quit the project after three months.
6245479	eng	About how long will it take to do that?
6245480	eng	I didn't exactly tell Tom the truth.
6245481	eng	Tom probably won't pass the examination.
6245482	eng	About how long does it take to do that?
6245483	eng	I can't imagine Tom ever doing that.
6245484	eng	Tom probably knows more than he told us.
6245485	eng	Your timing couldn't have been better.
6245486	eng	I can't believe you did that to Tom.
6245487	eng	Tom probably had a hard time doing that.
6245488	eng	Your handwriting is almost unreadable.
6245489	eng	I can see why Tom enjoys doing that.
6245490	eng	Tom probably had a good time doing that.
6245491	eng	Your French pronunciation is terrible.
6245492	eng	I bet Tom would be able to help you.
6245493	eng	Tom probably drinks more than he should.
6245494	eng	You've lost a few pounds, haven't you?
6245495	eng	I assumed Tom would want to do that.
6245496	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what happened.
6245497	eng	You've already graduated, haven't you?
6245498	eng	I asked Tom why I shouldn't do that.
6245499	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that I'm busy.
6245500	eng	You're willing to do that, aren't you?
6245501	eng	I asked Tom why I needed to do that.
6245502	eng	Tom probably doesn't know much about it.
6245503	eng	You're too young to apply for the job.
6245504	eng	I already know what Tom wants to do.
6245505	eng	Tom probably can't do that without help.
6245506	eng	You're through doing that, aren't you?
6245507	eng	I already know what Tom plans to do.
6245509	eng	You're the worst student in the class.
6245510	eng	How often does Tom get his hair cut?
6245511	eng	Tom planted roses in front of his house.
6245512	eng	You're the only one who can't do that.
6245513	eng	How often do you eat lunch with Tom?
6245514	eng	Tom opened the door and let his dog out.
6245515	eng	You're the one who told us to do that.
6245516	eng	How long did it take Tom to do that?
6245517	eng	Tom only answered some of the questions.
6245518	eng	You're the one I want to do that with.
6245519	eng	How did you know what Tom had to do?
6245520	eng	Tom often takes long walks on the beach.
6245521	eng	You're the best French speaker I know.
6245522	eng	Have you told Tom that you love him?
6245523	eng	Tom often forgets to turn off the light.
6245524	eng	You're one of the richest men in town.
6245525	eng	Even Tom didn't know how to do that.
6245526	eng	Tom never had an opportunity to do that.
6245527	eng	You're obliged to do that, aren't you?
6245528	eng	Don't you think Tom might be scared?
6245529	eng	Tom needs us to show him how to do that.
6245530	eng	You're in no rush to do that, are you?
6245531	eng	Don't you think Tom might be lonely?
6245532	eng	Tom needs to learn to think for himself.
6245533	eng	You're fortunate that you can do that.
6245534	eng	Don't forget to tell Tom to do that.
6245535	eng	Tom needs to be the next one to do that.
6245536	eng	You're a speech therapist, aren't you?
6245537	eng	Don't forget to pick Tom up at 2:30.
6245538	eng	Tom needs to be excused from doing that.
6245539	eng	You're a native of Boston, aren't you?
6245540	eng	Don't expect Tom to do that for you.
6245541	eng	Tom must've been tired when he got home.
6245542	eng	You're a graduate student, aren't you?
6245543	eng	Don't be surprised if Tom does that.
6245544	eng	Tom must be tired after working all day.
6245545	eng	You're a college graduate, aren't you?
6245546	eng	Does Tom still want to go to Boston?
6245547	eng	Tom might want to go to Boston with you.
6245548	eng	You're a Canadian citizen, aren't you?
6245549	eng	Does Tom still do that the same way?
6245550	eng	Tom might be coming to Boston next week.
6245551	eng	You'll never be able to do that again.
6245552	eng	Does Tom often go on business trips?
6245553	eng	Tom may stay in Boston for another week.
6245554	eng	You'll likely get very wet doing that.
6245555	eng	Does Tom always speak French to you?
6245556	eng	Tom manages a restaurant on Park Street.
6245557	eng	You'll have to do that someplace else.
6245558	eng	Do you want Tom to buy that for you?
6245560	eng	You'll get fired if you don't do that.
6245561	eng	Do you think Tom would lend me $300?
6245562	eng	Tom knows who can do that and who can't.
6245563	eng	You'll do that pretty soon, won't you?
6245564	eng	Do you think Tom was careful enough?
6245565	eng	Tom knows we aren't supposed to do that.
6245566	eng	You'll do that next Monday, won't you?
6245567	eng	Do you think Tom might be dishonest?
6245568	eng	Tom knows he no longer needs to do that.
6245569	eng	You'll do that immediately, won't you?
6245570	eng	Do you think Tom could be in Boston?
6245571	eng	Tom knows I'm supposed to do that today.
6245572	eng	You'll do that by yourself, won't you?
6245573	eng	Do you know why Tom kept doing that?
6245574	eng	Tom knew we weren't supposed to do that.
6245575	eng	You'll do that again today, won't you?
6245576	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to do that?
6245577	eng	Tom isn't the only one who's frustrated.
6245578	eng	You'll cook for us tonight, won't you?
6245579	eng	Didn't you know Tom played the oboe?
6245580	eng	Tom isn't the one who actually did that.
6245581	eng	You'd be stupid if you didn't do that.
6245582	eng	Didn't you know Tom lived in Boston?
6245583	eng	Tom isn't supposed to be doing that now.
6245584	eng	You wouldn't do that to me, would you?
6245585	eng	Didn't you know Tom had an accident?
6245586	eng	Tom isn't really sure what he should do.
6245587	eng	You wouldn't do that again, would you?
6245588	eng	Did you know where Tom wanted to go?
6245589	eng	Tom isn't really sure what he has to do.
6245590	eng	You won't do that this week, will you?
6245591	eng	Did you know that Tom would do that?
6245592	eng	Tom isn't likely to be retired yet.
6245593	eng	You won't be allowed to do that again.
6245594	eng	Did you know that Tom was a dentist?
6245595	eng	Tom isn't likely to be embarrassed.
6245597	eng	Did you know Tom was good at French?
6245598	eng	Tom isn't likely to be cooperative.
6245599	eng	You weren't able to do that, were you?
6245600	eng	Did you know Tom is good at cooking?
6245602	eng	You were able to do that, weren't you?
6245603	eng	Did you know Tom enjoyed doing that?
6245604	eng	Tom is very unlikely to want to do that.
6245605	eng	You were a child prodigy, weren't you?
6245606	eng	Could it have been Tom who did that?
6245607	eng	Tom is very frugal, but he's not stingy.
6245608	eng	You want to see me do that, don't you?
6245609	eng	Both of Tom's brothers were injured.
6245610	eng	Tom is trying to ignore what's going on.
6245611	eng	You used to be a comedian, didn't you?
6245612	eng	Ask Tom if he needs help doing that.
6245613	eng	Tom is the person I've been waiting for.
6245614	eng	You told me you wouldn't ever do that.
6245615	eng	All three of us were at Tom's party.
6245616	eng	Tom is the only person I know in Boston.
6245617	eng	You should've refused to go to Boston.
6245618	eng	All of Tom's children are in Boston.
6245619	eng	Tom is the only name on the list so far.
6245620	eng	You should probably not do that today.
6245621	eng	You're three months older than Tom.
6245622	eng	Tom is the one who should be doing that.
6245623	eng	You should have no problem doing that.
6245624	eng	You'll make Tom do that, won't you?
6245625	eng	Tom is still willing to do that for you.
6245626	eng	You should do that as soon as you can.
6245627	eng	You'll help Tom do that, won't you?
6245628	eng	Tom is still better at French than I am.
6245629	eng	You should come to visit us in Boston.
6245630	eng	You'll do that with Tom, won't you?
6245631	eng	Tom is probably not having a lot of fun.
6245632	eng	You should be the next one to do that.
6245633	eng	You were foolish to meet Tom again.
6245634	eng	Tom is one of the tallest people I know.
6245635	eng	You should be done doing that by 2:30.
6245636	eng	You want Tom to do that, don't you?
6245637	eng	Tom is much richer than you think he is.
6245638	eng	You should be able to do that as well.
6245639	eng	You still can't stand Tom, can you?
6245640	eng	Tom is lucky he's still able to do that.
6245641	eng	You seemed to be unwilling to do that.
6245642	eng	You shouldn't have let Tom do that.
6245643	eng	Tom is lucky he didn't lose his license.
6245644	eng	You seemed to be reluctant to do that.
6245645	eng	You should've asked Tom to do that.
6245646	eng	Tom is likely too distracted to do that.
6245647	eng	You seemed to be doing that very well.
6245648	eng	You should tell Tom you'll do that.
6245649	eng	Tom is likely to still be in his office.
6245650	eng	You seem to be a lot busier than I am.
6245651	eng	You should show Tom how to do that.
6245652	eng	Tom is likely to still be in Boston now.
6245653	eng	You remember what happened, don't you?
6245654	eng	You promised you'd do that for Tom.
6245655	eng	Tom is likely to be hesitant to do that.
6245656	eng	You really like to do that, don't you?
6245657	eng	You may talk to Tom if you want to.
6245658	eng	Tom is likely to be called as a witness.
6245659	eng	You really like doing that, don't you?
6245660	eng	You know what Tom wants, don't you?
6245661	eng	Tom is in the living room, taking a nap.
6245662	eng	You never do that by yourself, do you?
6245663	eng	Would Tom ever consider doing that?
6245664	eng	Tom is happy with how things turned out.
6245665	eng	You need to figure out how to do that.
6245666	eng	Will Tom work in Boston next month?
6245667	eng	Tom is going to be very glad to see you.
6245668	eng	You may use my hatchet if you want to.
6245669	eng	Will Tom stay in Boston all summer?
6245670	eng	Tom is considering becoming a bartender.
6245671	eng	You may use my bicycle if you want to.
6245672	eng	Will Tom really be able to do that?
6245673	eng	Tom is being taken care of by his uncle.
6245674	eng	You look like you're in a lot of pain.
6245675	eng	Will Tom be able to do that for us?
6245676	eng	Tom is beginning to do things like that.
6245677	eng	You look like you're going to be sick.
6245678	eng	Why didn't you have to go to Tom's?
6245679	eng	Tom is apparently a good trumpet player.
6245680	eng	You look like you might be interested.
6245681	eng	Why did that matter so much to Tom?
6245682	eng	Tom is apparently a good French speaker.
6245683	eng	You look like you could use some rest.
6245684	eng	Why did Tom need to be there early?
6245685	eng	Tom is an outstanding basketball player.
6245686	eng	You know why that happened, don't you?
6245687	eng	Why did Tom have to be there early?
6245688	eng	Tom is also not very good at doing that.
6245689	eng	You knew that I'd do that, didn't you?
6245690	eng	Why isn't Tom working here anymore?
6245691	eng	Tom is actually only thirteen years old.
6245692	eng	You knew I should do that, didn't you?
6245693	eng	Who told you Tom wanted to do that?
6245694	eng	Tom is able to do that without any help.
6245695	eng	You knew I had to do that, didn't you?
6245696	eng	Who told you Tom needed to do that?
6245697	eng	Tom is a very popular kid at his school.
6245698	eng	You just have to wait a little longer.
6245699	eng	Who told you Tom had been arrested?
6245700	eng	Tom is a real popular kid at his school.
6245701	eng	You have to stop doing that right now.
6245702	eng	Where does Tom usually go swimming?
6245703	eng	Tom introduced me to a very pretty girl.
6245704	eng	You have to figure out how to do that.
6245705	eng	Where did you and Tom go yesterday?
6245706	eng	Tom injured himself while playing rugby.
6245707	eng	You had many opportunities to do that.
6245708	eng	When's Tom coming back from Boston?
6245709	eng	Tom hung the lamp on the limb of a tree.
6245710	eng	You get up early every day, don't you?
6245711	eng	When do you think Tom will do that?
6245712	eng	Tom hopes that he'll be able to do that.
6245713	eng	You don't want to do that now, do you?
6245714	eng	When did you study French with Tom?
6245715	eng	Tom helped an old woman across the road.
6245716	eng	You don't think we'll do that, do you?
6245717	eng	What prevented Tom from doing that?
6245718	eng	Tom held that job for only three months.
6245719	eng	You don't think I can do that, do you?
6245720	eng	What did you tell Tom he had to do?
6245721	eng	Tom hasn't taught French in a long time.
6245722	eng	You don't seem to know how to do that.
6245723	eng	What Tom said was a little strange.
6245724	eng	Tom hasn't done that since October 20th.
6245725	eng	You don't seem to be eager to do that.
6245726	eng	What Tom is going to do is unclear.
6245727	eng	Tom hasn't done that as often as I have.
6245728	eng	You don't remember doing that, do you?
6245729	eng	What I'll do is ask Tom to do that.
6245730	eng	Tom hasn't come to work for three weeks.
6245731	eng	You don't really speak French, do you?
6245732	eng	We should take Tom to the hospital.
6245733	eng	Tom hasn't been punished for doing that.
6245734	eng	You don't need to shout. I'm not deaf.
6245735	eng	We expect Tom to do that on Monday.
6245736	eng	Tom hasn't accomplished anything so far.
6245737	eng	You don't need to know why I did that.
6245738	eng	We expect Tom to be back on Monday.
6245739	eng	Tom has told me he'll sign the contract.
6245740	eng	You don't need to do that now, do you?
6245741	eng	Was it you who told Tom to do that?
6245742	eng	Tom has told me I don't need to do that.
6245743	eng	You don't need to be young to do that.
6245744	eng	Was Tom in history class today?
6245745	eng	Tom has told me I don't have to do that.
6245746	eng	You don't know why I did that, do you?
6245747	eng	They don't pay Tom much to do that.
6245748	eng	Tom has three friends who are Canadians.
6245749	eng	You don't know how to do that, do you?
6245750	eng	There's no way Tom will be on time.
6245751	eng	Tom has three brothers who are triplets.
6245752	eng	You don't know how I did that, do you?
6245753	eng	The way Tom did that was brilliant.
6245754	eng	Tom has the ability to make that happen.
6245755	eng	You don't have you to do that anymore.
6245756	eng	The old TV Tom gave me didn't work.
6245757	eng	Tom has taught for the last three years.
6245758	eng	You don't have to be young to do that.
6245759	eng	That's not what Tom promised to do.
6245760	eng	Tom has started playing his banjo again.
6245761	eng	You don't get paid to do that, do you?
6245762	eng	Tell Tom not to do that by himself.
6245763	eng	Tom has started looking for another job.
6245764	eng	You don't do that like most people do.
6245765	eng	Perhaps Tom would enjoy doing that.
6245766	eng	Tom has promised to never be late again.
6245768	eng	Perhaps Tom won't do that tomorrow.
6245769	eng	Tom has promised to do better next time.
6245770	eng	You didn't look like you were shocked.
6245771	eng	Perhaps Tom is waiting for a reply.
6245772	eng	Tom has promised not to do that anymore.
6245773	eng	You didn't look like you were nervous.
6245774	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't use it anymore.
6245775	eng	Tom has postponed his trip to Australia.
6245776	eng	You didn't look like you were jealous.
6245777	eng	My guess is that Tom won't do that.
6245778	eng	Tom has personally helped me many times.
6245779	eng	You didn't do that last week, did you?
6245780	eng	Maybe Tom won't be able to do that.
6245781	eng	Tom has overstepped his authority again.
6245782	eng	You didn't do that after all, did you?
6245783	eng	Maybe Tom can get a job at the zoo.
6245784	eng	Tom has no choice but to try doing that.
6245785	eng	You did that very quickly, didn't you?
6245786	eng	It would be mean to do that to Tom.
6245787	eng	Tom has never said he wanted to do that.
6245788	eng	You definitely didn't need to do that.
6245789	eng	It was yesterday that Tom did that.
6245790	eng	Tom has moved out of his parents' house.
6245791	eng	You definitely didn't have to do that.
6245792	eng	It was last year that Tom did that.
6245793	eng	Tom has finally decided to go to Boston.
6245794	eng	You could come with me if you want to.
6245795	eng	It took Tom three hours to do that.
6245796	eng	Tom has done what he was supposed to do.
6245797	eng	You complained about that, didn't you?
6245798	eng	It seems that Tom wants to do that.
6245799	eng	Tom has done something like that before.
6245800	eng	You can sit next to me if you want to.
6245801	eng	It seems like Tom likes to do that.
6245802	eng	Tom has decided to go back to Australia.
6245803	eng	You apparently didn't need to do that.
6245804	eng	It seems like Tom likes doing that.
6245805	eng	Tom has contracted an incurable disease.
6245806	eng	You apparently didn't have to do that.
6245807	eng	It looks like Tom wants to do that.
6245808	eng	Tom has been waiting here for some time.
6245809	eng	You agreed not to do that, didn't you?
6245810	eng	Is it true that Tom didn't do that?
6245811	eng	Tom has been waiting for that to happen.
6245812	eng	Wouldn't you like to do that tomorrow?
6245813	eng	Is Tom still trying to lose weight?
6245814	eng	Tom has been told to do that by himself.
6245815	eng	Would you still be willing to do that?
6245816	eng	Is Tom still living on Park Street?
6245817	eng	Tom has been to Australia several times.
6245818	eng	Would you like something hot to drink?
6245819	eng	Is Tom still determined to do that?
6245820	eng	Tom has been teaching us some new stuff.
6245821	eng	Would you like me to buy that for you?
6245822	eng	Is Tom still be willing to do that?
6245823	eng	Tom has been teaching French since 2013.
6245824	eng	Will you go to Boston this month, too?
6245825	eng	I've never seen Tom do that before.
6245826	eng	Tom has been in his bedroom all evening.
6245827	eng	Will you clean your room this weekend?
6245828	eng	I've asked Tom to buy that for you.
6245829	eng	Tom has been in a coma for three months.
6245830	eng	Will it be all right to do that today?
6245831	eng	I'm very sure Tom needs to do that.
6245832	eng	Tom has been here for about three years.
6245833	eng	Why don't you want to do that with me?
6245834	eng	I'm sure that's what Tom has to do.
6245835	eng	Tom has been helping out in the kitchen.
6245836	eng	Why don't you let me buy that for you?
6245837	eng	I'm sure that's not Tom's umbrella.
6245838	eng	Tom has been doing that since yesterday.
6245839	eng	Why do you have a bandage on your arm?
6245840	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be surprised.
6245841	eng	Tom has been doing that his entire life.
6245842	eng	Why do people study foreign languages?
6245843	eng	I'm sure Tom would love to do that.
6245844	eng	Tom has been doing that for three years.
6245845	eng	Why didn't anyone tell me this before?
6245846	eng	I'm sure Tom would hate to do that.
6245847	eng	Tom has been doing that for a few years.
6245848	eng	Why did you need to stay after school?
6245849	eng	I'm sure Tom will help you do that.
6245850	eng	Tom has been accused of stealing $3,000.
6245851	eng	Whose son was in the traffic accident?
6245852	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom wants.
6245853	eng	Tom has asked the police for protection.
6245854	eng	Whose responsibility is it to do that?
6245855	eng	I'm not sure that's what Tom needs.
6245856	eng	Tom has always been interested in music.
6245857	eng	Who told you I didn't want to do that?
6245858	eng	I think Tom will be reasonable.
6245859	eng	Tom has already said that he'll do that.
6245860	eng	Who told you I didn't need to do that?
6245861	eng	I wouldn't tell Tom how to do that.
6245862	eng	Tom has already promised not to do that.
6245863	eng	Who told you I didn't have to do that?
6245864	eng	I wonder why Tom needed to do that.
6245865	eng	Tom has already done that several times.
6245866	eng	Who do you think would do that for us?
6245867	eng	I wonder whether Tom has done that.
6245868	eng	Tom has almost no experience doing that.
6245869	eng	When you're my age, you'll understand.
6245870	eng	I wonder if Tom would ever do that.
6245871	eng	Tom has advised me not to do that again.
6245872	eng	When will dinner be ready? I'm hungry.
6245873	eng	I wonder if Tom will do that today.
6245874	eng	Tom has a really strange sense of humor.
6245875	eng	What version of Windows are you using?
6245876	eng	I wonder if Tom is being sarcastic.
6245877	eng	Tom hardly ever gives his wife presents.
6245878	eng	What kinds of TV programs do you like?
6245879	eng	I won't tell Tom what he should do.
6245880	eng	Tom had to have been tempted to do that.
6245881	eng	What kind of art do you like the most?
6245882	eng	I won't tell Tom what I want to do.
6245883	eng	Tom had plenty of time to get that done.
6245884	eng	What do you want to do Monday evening?
6245885	eng	I won't ask Tom to do that anymore.
6245886	eng	Tom had no idea what he should be doing.
6245887	eng	We've already dealt with that problem.
6245888	eng	I wish you'd go to Boston with Tom.
6245889	eng	Tom had a son who was killed in the war.
6245890	eng	We're not supposed to do that anymore.
6245891	eng	I wasn't surprised by what Tom did.
6245892	eng	Tom had a lot of things he wanted to do.
6245893	eng	We're not supposed to burn trash here.
6245894	eng	I wanted to talk to Tom about that.
6245895	eng	Tom had a lot of things he needed to do.
6245896	eng	We'll still do that if you want us to.
6245897	eng	I wanted to kiss Tom, but I didn't.
6245898	eng	Tom got on his motorcycle and rode away.
6245899	eng	We'll come to Boston for your wedding.
6245900	eng	I wanted to go where Tom was going.
6245901	eng	Tom got most of the things he asked for.
6245902	eng	We were just in Boston a few days ago.
6245903	eng	I wanted Tom to do that by himself.
6245904	eng	Tom goes to the supermarket once a week.
6245905	eng	We need to get back to Boston tonight.
6245906	eng	I want to wait until Tom gets here.
6245907	eng	Tom gave the same answer he always does.
6245908	eng	We must work for at least three hours.
6245909	eng	I want to know who Tom's mother is.
6245910	eng	Tom frequently forgets to lock the door.
6245911	eng	We might not go to Boston this spring.
6245912	eng	I want to know who Tom's father is.
6245913	eng	Tom expects to be transferred to Boston.
6245914	eng	We may need to go to Boston on Monday.
6245915	eng	I want to buy a piggy bank for Tom.
6245916	eng	Tom expects all three of us to be there.
6245917	eng	We have to get back to Boston tonight.
6245918	eng	I tried to show Tom how to do that.
6245919	eng	Tom eats a sandwich every day for lunch.
6245920	eng	We have to do that while we still can.
6245921	eng	I tried to get Tom to study French.
6245922	eng	Tom doesn't write the speeches he gives.
6245923	eng	We could probably do that if we tried.
6245924	eng	I tried to convince Tom to do that.
6245925	eng	Tom doesn't want you to stop doing that.
6245926	eng	We can visit Boston, too, if you want.
6245927	eng	I told Tom that I couldn't do that.
6245928	eng	Tom doesn't want you to do that for him.
6245929	eng	This time I need to do that by myself.
6245930	eng	I told Tom I wouldn't ever do that.
6245931	eng	Tom doesn't want you to do that anymore.
6245932	eng	This shouldn't take much of your time.
6245933	eng	I told Tom I don't have to do that.
6245934	eng	Tom doesn't usually go to school by bus.
6245935	eng	This seems to be some kind of mistake.
6245936	eng	I told Tom I didn't have much time.
6245937	eng	Tom doesn't think that I should do that.
6245938	eng	This is the third time I've done this.
6245939	eng	I thought that would embarrass Tom.
6245940	eng	Tom doesn't think he's going to do that.
6245941	eng	This is a list of things I want to do.
6245942	eng	I thought Tom would be unimpressed.
6245943	eng	Tom doesn't think he'd enjoy doing that.
6245944	eng	This is a list of things I need to do.
6245945	eng	I thought Tom would be sympathetic.
6245946	eng	Tom doesn't smile as much as he used to.
6245947	eng	This is a list of things I have to do.
6245948	eng	I thought Tom would be heartbroken.
6245949	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know how to do that.
6245950	eng	They won't permit you to do that here.
6245951	eng	I thought Tom would be discouraged.
6245952	eng	Tom doesn't seem to have figured it out.
6245953	eng	There's no chance that that'll happen.
6245954	eng	I thought Tom would be cooperative.
6245955	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be enjoying himself.
6245956	eng	The price was higher than we expected.
6245957	eng	I thought Tom wasn't in his office.
6245958	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be eager to do that.
6245959	eng	The man driving our bus looked sleepy.
6245961	eng	Tom doesn't really care how you do that.
6245962	eng	The last few days have been very cold.
6245963	eng	I thought Tom was ready to do that.
6245964	eng	Tom doesn't realize what he needs to do.
6245965	eng	The judge's decision shocked everyone.
6245966	eng	I thought Tom was going to be shot.
6245967	eng	Tom doesn't need you to do that anymore.
6245968	eng	The judge's decision caused an uproar.
6245969	eng	I thought Tom was going to be late.
6245970	eng	Tom doesn't need to know why I did that.
6245971	eng	That would be impossible for me to do.
6245972	eng	I thought Tom was flirting with me.
6245973	eng	Tom doesn't like to throw anything away.
6245974	eng	Please explain to me how you did that.
6245975	eng	I thought Tom should buy a new car.
6245976	eng	Tom doesn't like to go horseback riding.
6245977	eng	Please do that for as long as you can.
6245978	eng	I thought I could help Tom do that.
6245979	eng	Tom doesn't like swimming in the winter.
6245980	eng	Perhaps it's not necessary to do that.
6245981	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be suspicious.
6245982	eng	Tom doesn't like baseball or basketball.
6245983	eng	People around here frequently do that.
6245984	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be interested.
6245985	eng	Tom doesn't know why you didn't do that.
6245986	eng	Old men are the only ones who do that.
6245987	eng	I think Tom would like to be alone.
6245988	eng	Tom doesn't know who's going to do that.
6245989	eng	Not everyone can afford such a luxury.
6245990	eng	I think Tom won't do that tomorrow.
6245991	eng	Tom doesn't know the value of education.
6245992	eng	No one but me is permitted to do that!
6245994	eng	Tom doesn't know how to get to my place.
6245995	eng	No one I know really likes doing that.
6245996	eng	I think Tom will be here on Monday.
6245997	eng	Tom doesn't know he's going to be fired.
6245999	eng	I think Tom said that he'd do that.
6246000	eng	Tom doesn't know exactly how to do that.
6246001	eng	My youngest daughter just got married.
6246002	eng	I think Tom is visiting Boston now.
6246004	eng	My shirt is drying on the clothesline.
6246005	eng	I think Tom is too lazy to do that.
6246006	eng	Tom doesn't have very many friends here.
6246007	eng	My parents won't permit me to do that.
6246008	eng	I think Tom is finished doing that.
6246009	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that immediately.
6246010	eng	My parents don't permit me to do that.
6246011	eng	I think Tom has a cousin in Boston.
6246012	eng	Tom doesn't have the stamina to do that.
6246013	eng	My parent's won't allow me to do that.
6246014	eng	I think Tom does that all the time.
6246015	eng	Tom doesn't have the ability to do that.
6246016	eng	My hearing has gradually gotten worse.
6246017	eng	I think Tom didn't need to do that.
6246018	eng	Tom doesn't have enough time to do that.
6246019	eng	My favorite day of the week is Monday.
6246020	eng	I think Tom didn't have to do that.
6246021	eng	Tom doesn't have as many stamps as I do.
6246022	eng	My children can speak French a little.
6246023	eng	I think Tom could teach you French.
6246024	eng	Tom doesn't care whether we come or not.
6246025	eng	My car gets thirty kilometers a liter.
6246026	eng	I think Tom could probably do that.
6246027	eng	Tom doesn't actually live in Boston now.
6246028	eng	My bicycle is a lot better than yours.
6246029	eng	I think Tom could be in Boston now.
6246030	eng	Tom does that because he wants to do it.
6246031	eng	My bedroom is much cleaner than yours.
6246032	eng	I think Tom could be back tomorrow.
6246033	eng	Tom does that because he loves doing it.
6246034	eng	Mt. Fuji is a very beautiful mountain.
6246035	eng	I think Tom could actually do that.
6246036	eng	Tom disliked being treated like a child.
6246037	eng	Most people here can't swim very well.
6246038	eng	I think Tom can't actually do that.
6246039	eng	Tom died on the morning of October 20th.
6246040	eng	Most of the passengers were uninjured.
6246041	eng	I think Tom can do that by himself.
6246042	eng	Tom died on his way back from Australia.
6246043	eng	Monday would be a good day to do that.
6246044	eng	I think I could get Tom to do that.
6246045	eng	Tom died in the same bed he was born in.
6246046	eng	Monday is my favorite day of the week.
6246047	eng	I still can't believe Tom did that.
6246048	eng	Tom didn't think that you could do that.
6246049	eng	Maybe I can come to Boston in October.
6246050	eng	I should've laughed at Tom's jokes.
6246051	eng	Tom didn't tell me why I had to do that.
6246052	eng	Mary looks beautiful in her new dress.
6246053	eng	I should try to get Tom to do that.
6246054	eng	Tom didn't tell me he'd never done that.
6246055	eng	Mary isn't as beautiful as her sister.
6246056	eng	I should tell Tom to go home early.
6246057	eng	Tom didn't tell me he'd gotten divorced.
6246058	eng	Mary is the best-looking woman I know.
6246059	eng	I should tell Tom not to be afraid.
6246060	eng	Tom didn't seem like an intelligent man.
6246061	eng	Mary is getting prettier and prettier.
6246062	eng	I should probably help Tom do that.
6246063	eng	Tom didn't say why he came here by taxi.
6246064	eng	Let's rest a little before doing that.
6246065	eng	I should get Tom to do that for me.
6246066	eng	Tom didn't know what he should be doing.
6246067	eng	Let's not delay doing that any longer.
6246068	eng	I should do what Tom told me to do.
6246069	eng	Tom didn't know that you would be there.
6246070	eng	It's raining now, so we can't do that.
6246071	eng	I should ask Tom to do that for me.
6246072	eng	Tom didn't know that I couldn't do that.
6246073	eng	It's probably too late to do that now.
6246074	eng	I often do the same thing Tom does.
6246075	eng	Tom didn't know how long he should wait.
6246077	eng	I noticed that Tom's door was open.
6246078	eng	Tom didn't expect to be able to do that.
6246079	eng	It's not my responsibility to do that.
6246080	eng	I know you didn't buy that for Tom.
6246081	eng	Tom didn't do everything you say he did.
6246082	eng	It's going to be very easy to do that.
6246083	eng	I know why Tom should've done that.
6246084	eng	Tom didn't do everything he said he did.
6246085	eng	It's finally time to start doing that.
6246086	eng	I know why Tom doesn't like Boston.
6246087	eng	Tom didn't dare express his own opinion.
6246088	eng	It'll probably be possible to do that.
6246089	eng	I know the reason why Tom did that.
6246090	eng	Tom did know he was supposed to do that.
6246091	eng	It'll be almost impossible to do that.
6246092	eng	I know that Tom is being sarcastic.
6246093	eng	Tom did everything he felt he had to do.
6246094	eng	It wouldn't be helpful to do that now.
6246095	eng	I know all three of Tom's brothers.
6246096	eng	Tom devoted a lot of time to doing that.
6246097	eng	It wouldn't be easy for us to do that.
6246098	eng	I know Tom will eventually do that.
6246099	eng	Tom could've done that without our help.
6246100	eng	It wouldn't be a good idea to do that.
6246101	eng	I know Tom isn't telling the truth.
6246102	eng	Tom could've been in Boston last Monday.
6246103	eng	It would've been unethical to do that.
6246104	eng	I know Tom isn't likely to do that.
6246105	eng	Tom could still do that better, I think.
6246106	eng	It would've been expensive to do that.
6246107	eng	I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
6246108	eng	Tom could only do that for a short time.
6246109	eng	It would've been dangerous to do that.
6246110	eng	I know Tom can't do that very well.
6246111	eng	Tom could face a three-year prison term.
6246112	eng	It would be very unethical to do that.
6246113	eng	I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
6246114	eng	Tom could be tough when he needed to be.
6246115	eng	It would be very obnoxious to do that.
6246116	eng	I knew Tom would refuse to do that.
6246117	eng	Tom could be a teacher if he wanted to be.
6246118	eng	It would be possible to do that again.
6246119	eng	I knew Tom wasn't going to do that.
6246120	eng	Tom could be prejudiced, but I doubt it.
6246121	eng	It would be nice if you could do that.
6246122	eng	I knew Tom was planning to do that.
6246123	eng	Tom could be frightened, but I doubt it.
6246124	eng	It would be great if we could do that.
6246125	eng	I hope Tom won't refuse to do that.
6246126	eng	Tom could be finished doing that by now.
6246127	eng	It would be good to do that this week.
6246128	eng	I hope Tom won't ask me to do that.
6246129	eng	Tom continued doing that his whole life.
6246130	eng	It was very foolish of you to do that.
6246131	eng	I hope Tom will do that by himself.
6246132	eng	Tom caught three passes in today's game.
6246133	eng	It was a problem, but not a major one.
6246134	eng	I hope Tom knows who won't do that.
6246135	eng	Tom can't have forgotten how to do that.
6246136	eng	It takes about three hours to do that.
6246137	eng	I hope Tom knows what he should do.
6246138	eng	Tom can do both things at the same time.
6246139	eng	It shouldn't cost too much to do that.
6246140	eng	I hope Tom knows what he has to do.
6246141	eng	Tom can be in Boston by Monday, I think.
6246142	eng	It should be cheap for you to do that.
6246143	eng	I hope Tom knows he has to do that.
6246144	eng	Tom came to visit me three weekends ago.
6246145	eng	It probably won't be cheap to do that.
6246146	eng	I hope Tom is motivated to do that.
6246147	eng	Tom brags about how well he can do that.
6246148	eng	It looks like you're in a lot of pain.
6246149	eng	I hope Tom is doing well in school.
6246150	eng	Tom bought his wife whatever she wanted.
6246151	eng	It looks like you're having a bad day.
6246152	eng	I hope Tom is doing that right now.
6246153	eng	Tom believed that he would win the race.
6246154	eng	It gets pretty hot here in the summer.
6246155	eng	I hope Tom doesn't want to do that.
6246156	eng	Tom assured us that he wouldn't do that.
6246157	eng	It doesn't look like you're impressed.
6246158	eng	I hope Tom doesn't need to do that.
6246159	eng	Tom assured me that he wouldn't do that.
6246160	eng	It doesn't look like you're exhausted.
6246161	eng	I hope Tom doesn't make us do that.
6246162	eng	Tom asked me why I didn't eat breakfast.
6246163	eng	Is there anything else you need to do?
6246164	eng	I helped Tom deal with the problem.
6246165	eng	Tom asked me to tell him why I did that.
6246166	eng	Is there anything else you have to do?
6246167	eng	I heard that Tom wanted to do that.
6246168	eng	Tom asked me to show you how to do that.
6246169	eng	If you tell me what to do, I'll do it.
6246170	eng	I heard Tom won't do that tomorrow.
6246171	eng	Tom asked me if I really had to do that.
6246172	eng	If it rains tomorrow, I won't do that.
6246173	eng	I haven't yet reported Tom missing.
6246174	eng	Tom asked if he was required to do that.
6246175	eng	If I had enough time, I could do that.
6246176	eng	I haven't said anything to Tom yet.
6246177	eng	Tom apparently shouldn't have done that.
6246178	eng	I've read all the books on this shelf.
6246179	eng	I forgot to thank Tom for the gift.
6246180	eng	Tom apparently has no desire to do that.
6246181	eng	I've only done that about three times.
6246182	eng	I forgot to thank Tom for his help.
6246183	eng	Tom apparently had no desire to do that.
6246184	eng	I've often gone to Boston on business.
6246185	eng	I expect Tom will do that tomorrow.
6246186	eng	Tom apologized for doing that years ago.
6246187	eng	I've never done that, but I'd like to.
6246188	eng	I doubt if Tom will be sympathetic.
6246189	eng	Tom answered yes to all three questions.
6246190	eng	I've had a lot of practice doing that.
6246191	eng	I doubt if Tom will be embarrassed.
6246192	eng	Tom and his teenage son moved to Boston.
6246193	eng	I've already read some of these books.
6246194	eng	I doubt if Tom will be disobedient.
6246195	eng	Tom and I've known each other for years.
6246196	eng	I've already done what I needed to do.
6246197	eng	I doubt if Tom will be discouraged.
6246198	eng	Tom and I've decided not to get married.
6246199	eng	I'm very busy now, so I can't do that.
6246200	eng	I doubt if Tom will be cooperative.
6246201	eng	Tom and I weren't the ones who did that.
6246202	eng	I'm tired, so I don't want to do that.
6246203	eng	I don't want to ask Tom to do that.
6246204	eng	Tom and I were told to stay in our room.
6246205	eng	I'm three months away from graduation.
6246206	eng	I don't want Tom to move to Boston.
6246207	eng	Tom and I were surprised by what we saw.
6246208	eng	I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6246209	eng	I don't want Tom to do that for me.
6246210	eng	Tom and I were living in Boston in 2013.
6246211	eng	I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6246212	eng	I don't want Tom to come to Boston.
6246213	eng	Tom and I want to study French together.
6246214	eng	I'm the only one who knows what to do.
6246215	eng	I don't think that I can trust Tom.
6246216	eng	Tom and I usually study French together.
6246217	eng	I'm the only one permitted to do that.
6246218	eng	I don't think Tom would lie to you.
6246219	eng	Tom and I threw snowballs at each other.
6246220	eng	I'm studying to become an interpreter.
6246221	eng	I don't think Tom would be jealous.
6246222	eng	Tom and I take turns washing the dishes.
6246223	eng	I'm still not very good at volleyball.
6246224	eng	I don't think Tom will remember me.
6246225	eng	Tom and I still aren't ready to do that.
6246226	eng	I'm still not very good at doing that.
6246227	eng	I don't think Tom will be stubborn.
6246228	eng	Tom and I speak to each other in French.
6246229	eng	I'm sorry I couldn't buy that for you.
6246230	eng	I don't think Tom will be punctual.
6246231	eng	Tom and I shared a hotel room in Boston.
6246232	eng	I'm really glad I was able to do that.
6246233	eng	I don't think Tom will be obedient.
6246234	eng	Tom and I often work together on Monday.
6246235	eng	I'm not the only one who has a camera.
6246236	eng	I don't think Tom will be confused.
6246237	eng	Tom and I often tell each other stories.
6246238	eng	I'm not the one who actually did that.
6246239	eng	I don't think Tom will be careless.
6246240	eng	Tom and I nodded to each other politely.
6246241	eng	I'm not sure that's what I want to do.
6246242	eng	I don't think Tom was being unfair.
6246243	eng	Tom and I met at a New Year's Eve party.
6246244	eng	I'm not sure that's what I need to do.
6246245	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that.
6246246	eng	Tom and I live in the same part of town.
6246247	eng	I'm not sure that's what I have to do.
6246248	eng	I don't think Tom ought to do that.
6246249	eng	Tom and I live in the same neighborhood.
6246250	eng	I'm not sure if I'll do that tomorrow.
6246251	eng	I don't think Tom needs to do that.
6246252	eng	Tom and I haven't done our homework yet.
6246253	eng	I'm not supposed to do that by myself.
6246254	eng	I don't think Tom is very talented.
6246255	eng	Tom and I have always been good friends.
6246256	eng	I'm not responsible for what happened.
6246257	eng	I don't think Tom is uncomfortable.
6246258	eng	Tom and I have almost nothing in common.
6246259	eng	I'm not looking forward to doing that.
6246261	eng	Tom and I have a very good relationship.
6246262	eng	I'm not interested in going to Boston.
6246263	eng	I don't really care what Tom wants.
6246264	eng	Tom and I hardly ever agree on anything.
6246265	eng	I'm not going to do that next weekend.
6246266	eng	I don't often let Tom drive my car.
6246267	eng	Tom and I had a huge fight this morning.
6246268	eng	I'm not going anywhere this afternoon.
6246269	eng	I don't like science, but Tom does.
6246270	eng	Tom and I had a good time playing chess.
6246271	eng	I'm not coming to Boston this weekend.
6246272	eng	I don't let Tom do that by himself.
6246273	eng	Tom and I don't often do the same thing.
6246274	eng	I'm not certain I'll do that tomorrow.
6246275	eng	I don't know why Tom was in prison.
6246276	eng	Tom and I don't love each other anymore.
6246277	eng	I'm having trouble remembering things.
6246278	eng	I don't know why Tom is doing that.
6246279	eng	Tom and I do almost everything together.
6246280	eng	I'm certain that'll happen eventually.
6246281	eng	I don't know why Tom got impatient.
6246282	eng	Tom and I aren't very likely to do that.
6246283	eng	I'm afraid I won't be able to do that.
6246284	eng	I don't know who built Tom's house.
6246285	eng	Tom and I aren't speaking to each other.
6246286	eng	I'll write to you at your new address.
6246287	eng	I don't know where to wait for Tom.
6246288	eng	Tom and I are still making up our minds.
6246289	eng	I'll teach French in Boston next year.
6246290	eng	I don't know where to look for Tom.
6246291	eng	Tom and I are having a really good time.
6246292	eng	I'll remember today as long as I live.
6246293	eng	I don't know where Tom wants to go.
6246294	eng	Tom and I are getting married next year.
6246295	eng	I'll probably go to Boston in October.
6246296	eng	I don't know where Tom needs to go.
6246297	eng	Tom and I are busy planning our wedding.
6246298	eng	I'll never forgive you if you do that.
6246299	eng	I don't know when Tom will do that.
6246300	eng	Tom always eats lunch with us on Monday.
6246301	eng	I'll never forgive you for doing that.
6246302	eng	I don't know when Tom will be here.
6246303	eng	Tom almost never does that before lunch.
6246304	eng	I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow.
6246305	eng	I don't know what Tom wants to eat.
6246306	eng	Tom actually stayed in Boston all month.
6246307	eng	I'll be doing that tomorrow afternoon.
6246308	eng	I don't know what Tom wants to buy.
6246309	eng	Tom's wife is just as strange as he is.
6246310	eng	I'd speak to you in French if I could.
6246311	eng	I don't know what Tom really wants.
6246312	eng	Tom's singing didn't impress me at all.
6246313	eng	I'd rather stay here than go anywhere.
6246314	eng	I don't know what Tom is doing now.
6246315	eng	Tom's first book was published in 2013.
6246316	eng	I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
6246317	eng	I don't know if Tom is busy or not.
6246318	eng	Tom's designs didn't impress me at all.
6246319	eng	I'd like to figure out how to do that.
6246320	eng	I don't know how to respond to Tom.
6246321	eng	Tom's car is parked in front of my car.
6246322	eng	I'd like a couple of kilos of loquats.
6246323	eng	I don't know any of Tom's children.
6246324	eng	Tom's business is doing extremely well.
6246325	eng	I'd do that for you if you want me to.
6246326	eng	I don't know Tom as well as you do.
6246327	eng	Tom wrote one of the songs on my album.
6246328	eng	I'd do that again if I had the chance.
6246329	eng	I don't have any idea where Tom is.
6246330	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that by himself.
6246332	eng	I didn't want to tell Tom anything.
6246333	eng	Tom would never have agreed to do that.
6246334	eng	I wouldn't visit Boston if I were you.
6246335	eng	I didn't want to go to Tom's party.
6246336	eng	Tom would be surprised if you did that.
6246337	eng	I wouldn't go to Boston if I were you.
6246338	eng	I didn't want to go there with Tom.
6246339	eng	Tom would be impressed if you did that.
6246340	eng	I wonder why we don't have to do that.
6246341	eng	I didn't want to be alone with Tom.
6246342	eng	Tom worked in Boston from 2003 to 2013.
6246343	eng	I wonder why I didn't have to do that.
6246344	eng	I didn't want Tom to do that again.
6246345	eng	Tom won't likely want to do that again.
6246346	eng	I wonder if it's safe to do that here.
6246347	eng	I didn't think that Tom was hungry.
6246348	eng	Tom won't likely need to do that again.
6246349	eng	I wonder if it's dangerous to do that.
6246350	eng	I didn't think Tom would be sleepy.
6246351	eng	Tom won't likely have to do that today.
6246352	eng	I wonder if it would be OK to do that.
6246353	eng	I didn't think Tom would be scared.
6246354	eng	Tom won't likely have to do that again.
6246355	eng	I won't permit you to do that anymore.
6246356	eng	I didn't think Tom would be lonely.
6246357	eng	Tom won't likely be through doing that.
6246358	eng	I won't do that unless you do it, too.
6246359	eng	I didn't think Tom would be afraid.
6246360	eng	Tom won't likely be tempted to do that.
6246361	eng	I wish we had stayed in Boston longer.
6246362	eng	I didn't think Tom would be absent.
6246363	eng	Tom won't likely be grumpy again today.
6246364	eng	I wish we could stay in Boston longer.
6246365	eng	I didn't think Tom was embarrassed.
6246366	eng	Tom won't likely be absent again today.
6246367	eng	I wish I'd had enough time to do that.
6246368	eng	I didn't think Tom was discouraged.
6246369	eng	Tom won't be permitted to do that here.
6246370	eng	I wish I'd been old enough to do that.
6246371	eng	I didn't think Tom was cooperative.
6246372	eng	Tom won't be amused by what's going on.
6246373	eng	I wish I hadn't looked out the window.
6246374	eng	I didn't tell Tom which hat to buy.
6246375	eng	Tom won't be allowed to do that either.
6246376	eng	I wish I hadn't left the windows open.
6246377	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I was doing.
6246378	eng	Tom won't be able to solve the problem.
6246379	eng	I wasn't in the mood to do that today.
6246380	eng	I didn't tell Tom what I had to do.
6246381	eng	Tom won't be able to do that very well.
6246382	eng	I was too young to drive at that time.
6246383	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I loved him.
6246384	eng	Tom won't be able to do that every day.
6246385	eng	I was too young to drink at that time.
6246386	eng	I didn't tell Tom about this place.
6246387	eng	Tom will probably volunteer to do that.
6246388	eng	I was the only one who had to do that.
6246389	eng	I didn't tell Tom I'd gotten fired.
6246390	eng	Tom will probably pass the examination.
6246391	eng	I was the only one who didn't do that.
6246392	eng	I didn't really think Tom did that.
6246393	eng	Tom will probably be impressed by that.
6246394	eng	I was the only one allowed to do that.
6246395	eng	I didn't realize that Tom had left.
6246396	eng	Tom will probably be at home on Monday.
6246397	eng	I was the one who should've done that.
6246398	eng	I didn't realize how smart Tom was.
6246399	eng	Tom will probably be afraid to do that.
6246400	eng	I was on a sick leave for three weeks.
6246401	eng	I didn't realize I had to help Tom.
6246402	eng	Tom will probably agree not to do that.
6246403	eng	I was hoping you could do that for me.
6246404	eng	I didn't pay much attention to Tom.
6246405	eng	Tom will likely be hesitant to do that.
6246406	eng	I was aware that I was being followed.
6246407	eng	I didn't offer Tom anything to eat.
6246408	eng	Tom will likely be doing that tomorrow.
6246409	eng	I was able to do that on my third try.
6246410	eng	I didn't notice what Tom was up to.
6246411	eng	Tom will get an opportunity to do that.
6246412	eng	I want to stay here until next Monday.
6246413	eng	I didn't notice what Tom was doing.
6246414	eng	Tom will be downstairs waiting for you.
6246415	eng	I want to spend time with my children.
6246416	eng	I didn't like what I saw Tom doing.
6246417	eng	Tom went to the well to get some water.
6246418	eng	I want to see what's in your suitcase.
6246419	eng	I didn't like it when Tom did that.
6246420	eng	Tom went and got a book from the shelf.
6246421	eng	I want to rent an apartment in Boston.
6246422	eng	I didn't know you were helping Tom.
6246423	eng	Tom wasn't very irritated by the noise.
6246424	eng	I want to learn how to play badminton.
6246425	eng	I didn't know what Tom was reading.
6246426	eng	Tom wasn't the first person here today.
6246427	eng	I want to know who you ate lunch with.
6246428	eng	I didn't know what Tom was cooking.
6246429	eng	Tom wasn't given the chance to do that.
6246430	eng	I want to know what you'd like to eat.
6246431	eng	I didn't know that Tom was unhappy.
6246432	eng	Tom was too scared to go into the cave.
6246433	eng	I want to know if you're free tonight.
6246434	eng	I didn't know that Tom was married.
6246435	eng	Tom was told not to do that by himself.
6246436	eng	I want to help, but I don't have time.
6246437	eng	I didn't know that Tom was in town.
6246438	eng	Tom was the one who told us to do that.
6246439	eng	I want to eat Chinese food for dinner.
6246440	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't do that.
6246441	eng	Tom was the first one to get that done.
6246442	eng	I want to do that before it gets dark.
6246443	eng	I didn't know Tom was your husband.
6246444	eng	Tom was the first one to be eliminated.
6246445	eng	I want to do that as soon as possible.
6246446	eng	I didn't know Tom was your brother.
6246447	eng	Tom was the captain of basketball team.
6246448	eng	I want to come to Boston next weekend.
6246449	eng	I didn't know Tom was still single.
6246450	eng	Tom was sitting on a bench in the park.
6246451	eng	I want to buy some books for children.
6246452	eng	I didn't know Tom couldn't do that.
6246453	eng	Tom was only permitted to do that once.
6246454	eng	I want to be the first one to do that.
6246455	eng	I didn't know I was older than Tom.
6246456	eng	Tom was one of those who were laid off.
6246457	eng	I want to be a professional violinist.
6246458	eng	I didn't intend to let Tom kiss me.
6246459	eng	Tom was one of those who were arrested.
6246460	eng	I want all of you to listen carefully.
6246461	eng	I didn't have to explain it to Tom.
6246462	eng	Tom was mugged by three men in hoodies.
6246463	eng	I try to do that at least once a week.
6246464	eng	I didn't get on the train with Tom.
6246465	eng	Tom was in a hurry because he was late.
6246466	eng	I thought you'd be doing that all day.
6246467	eng	I didn't get a chance to thank Tom.
6246468	eng	Tom was already asleep when I got home.
6246469	eng	I thought you'd be at today's meeting.
6246470	eng	I didn't expect Tom to outsmart me.
6246471	eng	Tom wanted to be in Boston last Monday.
6246472	eng	I thought you were supposed to be strong.
6246473	eng	I didn't expect Tom to be so tired.
6246474	eng	Tom wanted me to go to Boston with him.
6246475	eng	I thought you said I couldn't do that.
6246476	eng	I didn't do what Tom told me to do.
6246477	eng	Tom very rarely does that before lunch.
6246478	eng	I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
6246479	eng	I didn't discuss the plan with Tom.
6246480	eng	Tom usually has a good time doing that.
6246481	eng	I thought we weren't going to do that.
6246482	eng	I didn't buy Tom what he asked for.
6246483	eng	Tom tried to drown himself last summer.
6246484	eng	I thought it was dangerous to do that.
6246485	eng	I didn't allow Tom to drive my car.
6246486	eng	Tom told us he could understand French.
6246487	eng	I thought I'd go to Boston next month.
6246488	eng	I did the exact same thing Tom did.
6246490	eng	I thought I'd be doing that by myself.
6246491	eng	I can't move as quickly as Tom can.
6246492	eng	Tom told me that he's ready to do that.
6246493	eng	I thought I smelled something rotting.
6246494	eng	I can't believe Tom is over thirty.
6246495	eng	Tom told me that he'd do that tomorrow.
6246496	eng	I thought I might not need to do that.
6246497	eng	I called Tom to ask him to do that.
6246498	eng	Tom told me that he has just done that.
6246499	eng	I thought I might not have to do that.
6246500	eng	I bet Tom would be able to do that.
6246501	eng	Tom told me that I was being too bossy.
6246502	eng	I think it would be a mistake to do that.
6246504	eng	Tom told me that I should quit smoking.
6246505	eng	I think something strange is going on.
6246506	eng	How can we convince Tom to do that?
6246507	eng	Tom told me that I should do that soon.
6246508	eng	I think it's probably safe to do that.
6246509	eng	How can I make Tom stop doing that?
6246510	eng	Tom told me that I looked disorganized.
6246511	eng	I think it's probably easy to do that.
6246512	eng	Have you told Tom why you did that?
6246513	eng	Tom told me last night he might retire.
6246514	eng	I think it might be unsafe to do that.
6246515	eng	Have you asked Tom why he did that?
6246516	eng	Tom told me it would be fun to do that.
6246517	eng	I think it might be stupid to do that.
6246518	eng	Has Tom ever considered doing that?
6246519	eng	Tom told me he'd just gotten a divorce.
6246520	eng	I think doing that would be too risky.
6246521	eng	Has Tom been living in Boston long?
6246522	eng	Tom told his son to eat his vegetables.
6246523	eng	I think doing that would be a mistake.
6246524	eng	Everyone went to Boston except Tom.
6246525	eng	Tom thinks he won't be able to do that.
6246526	eng	I think doing that won't be very easy.
6246527	eng	Don't you try to blame this on Tom.
6246528	eng	Tom tends to drink too much at parties.
6246529	eng	I think doing that should be possible.
6246530	eng	Don't forget to ask Tom to do that.
6246531	eng	Tom taught French here for three years.
6246532	eng	I think doing that might be dangerous.
6246533	eng	Don't do that until Tom gets there.
6246534	eng	Tom strongly advised me not to do that.
6246535	eng	I think I'll be able to do that today.
6246536	eng	Doing that wouldn't make Tom happy.
6246537	eng	Tom still wants to do that, doesn't he?
6246538	eng	I think I can do that faster than you.
6246539	eng	Does Tom need to be doing that now?
6246540	eng	Tom still needs to do that, doesn't he?
6246541	eng	I still have to read three more pages.
6246542	eng	Does Tom have to be doing that now?
6246543	eng	Tom still manages to do that very well.
6246544	eng	I shouldn't have to work this weekend.
6246545	eng	Does Tom have the skill to do that?
6246546	eng	Tom still hasn't answered my questions.
6246547	eng	I should've stayed at home last night.
6246548	eng	Does Tom always do that by himself?
6246549	eng	Tom still does that as often as he can.
6246550	eng	I should've done that three weeks ago.
6246551	eng	Do you think Tom will be surprised?
6246552	eng	Tom started doing that three years ago.
6246553	eng	I should've bought something to drink.
6246554	eng	Do you think Tom will be exhausted?
6246555	eng	Tom started doing that a few weeks ago.
6246556	eng	I should've been a little more polite.
6246557	eng	Do you think Tom is too aggressive?
6246558	eng	Tom stacked the dishes in the cupboard.
6246559	eng	I should wait until Monday to do that.
6246560	eng	Do you think Tom is doing that now?
6246561	eng	Tom spent three months in the hospital.
6246562	eng	I should be able to do that on my own.
6246563	eng	Do you still permit Tom to do that?
6246564	eng	Tom spent the whole day playing guitar.
6246565	eng	I should be able to do that by myself.
6246566	eng	Do you know why Tom had to do that?
6246567	eng	Tom spent almost three years in prison.
6246568	eng	I saw something floating in the water.
6246569	eng	Didn't you know that Tom had a dog?
6246570	eng	Tom spent a lot of time in the library.
6246571	eng	I remember having done that somewhere.
6246572	eng	Didn't you know Tom would be there?
6246573	eng	Tom spends a lot of time reading books.
6246574	eng	I regret not staying in Boston longer.
6246575	eng	Didn't you know Tom was doing that?
6246576	eng	Tom spends a lot of time playing games.
6246577	eng	I regret not having done that earlier.
6246578	eng	Didn't you know Tom was a Canadian?
6246579	eng	Tom sometimes eats out with his family.
6246580	eng	I really can't speak French very well.
6246581	eng	Didn't you know Tom had to do that?
6246582	eng	Tom sometimes helps me with my homework.
6246583	eng	I realized I didn't have enough money.
6246584	eng	Didn't you know Tom died in Boston?
6246585	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that yesterday.
6246586	eng	I promised you I'd help you, didn't I?
6246587	eng	Did you know that Tom was Canadian?
6246588	eng	Tom shouldn't be doing that by himself.
6246589	eng	I probably won't try to do that again.
6246590	eng	Did you know Tom wasn't happy here?
6246591	eng	Tom shouldn't be allowed any more time.
6246592	eng	I'm pretty sure I won't have to do that.
6246593	eng	Did you know Tom wanted to do that?
6246594	eng	Tom should've sent a letter of apology.
6246595	eng	I never knew Mr. Jackson's first name.
6246596	eng	Did you know Tom played the guitar?
6246597	eng	Tom should've gone to Boston last week.
6246598	eng	I never had an opportunity to do that.
6246599	eng	Did you know Tom needed to do that?
6246600	eng	Tom should've done that, but he didn't.
6246601	eng	I need to do that as soon as possible.
6246602	eng	Did you know Tom is good at French?
6246603	eng	Tom should've done that three days ago.
6246604	eng	I need a volunteer to help me do that.
6246605	eng	Did you know Tom has been arrested?
6246606	eng	Tom should've done that somewhere else.
6246607	eng	I need a pair of scissors to cut this.
6246608	eng	Did Tom stay in Boston last summer?
6246609	eng	Tom should've done that someplace else.
6246610	eng	I may have to give a speech in French.
6246611	eng	Could you show me a picture of Tom?
6246612	eng	Tom should've done that more carefully.
6246613	eng	I learned how to do that the hard way.
6246614	eng	Ask Tom what he wants to listen to.
6246615	eng	Tom should probably not have done that.
6246616	eng	I know why you didn't want to do that.
6246617	eng	Ask Tom if he knows how to do that.
6246618	eng	Tom should know better than to do that.
6246619	eng	I know that won't happen anytime soon.
6246620	eng	Ask Tom if he can help us tomorrow.
6246621	eng	Tom should have a good time doing that.
6246622	eng	I know about everything that happened.
6246623	eng	All of Tom's toys are made of wood.
6246624	eng	Tom should do that as soon as possible.
6246625	eng	I know I'll need to help you tomorrow.
6246626	eng	"Is Tom afraid?" "Yes, I think so."
6246627	eng	Tom should be the first one to do that.
6246628	eng	I knew doing that would be worthwhile.
6246629	eng	"Has Tom done that?" "No, not yet."
6246630	eng	Tom should be interested in doing that.
6246631	eng	I knew I'd be able to do that by 2:30.
6246632	eng	Your singing really impressed Tom.
6246633	eng	Tom seldom, if ever, eats meat anymore.
6246634	eng	I knew I might be required to do that.
6246635	eng	You're three years older than Tom.
6246636	eng	Tom seldom, if ever, does that anymore.
6246637	eng	I just did that less than an hour ago.
6246638	eng	You're a good deal older than Tom.
6246639	eng	Tom seems to enjoy reading comic books.
6246640	eng	I just can't stay here and do nothing.
6246641	eng	You're a few years older than Tom.
6246642	eng	Tom seemed to do that better this time.
6246643	eng	I intend to get that done by tomorrow.
6246644	eng	You're a better musician than Tom.
6246645	eng	Tom seemed to be in a hurry to do that.
6246646	eng	I hope I didn't keep you waiting long.
6246647	eng	You're Tom's neighbor, aren't you?
6246648	eng	Tom seemed to be doing a very nice job.
6246649	eng	I helped the old woman cross the road.
6246650	eng	You'll let Tom do that, won't you?
6246651	eng	Tom seemed to be determined to do that.
6246652	eng	I helped the old lady across the road.
6246653	eng	You'll do that for Tom, won't you?
6246654	eng	Tom seemed amused by what was going on.
6246655	eng	I helped an old man across the street.
6246656	eng	You'll ask Tom do that, won't you?
6246657	eng	Tom scraped his knee when he fell down.
6246658	eng	I heard you actually tried to do that.
6246659	eng	You think Tom did that, don't you?
6246660	eng	Tom says we don't have time to do that.
6246661	eng	I haven't finished writing the report.
6246662	eng	You do that the same way Tom does.
6246663	eng	Tom says that he won't do that anymore.
6246664	eng	I haven't finished reading the report.
6246665	eng	Would you really buy that for Tom?
6246666	eng	Tom says he's ready to help us do that.
6246667	eng	I haven't been doing that much lately.
6246668	eng	Would Tom really buy that for you?
6246669	eng	Tom says he's not a member of any club.
6246670	eng	I haven't been back to Boston in years.
6246671	eng	Will Tom live in Boston next year?
6246672	eng	Tom says he's been injured three times.
6246673	vie	Bạn có mấy anh chị em?
6246674	eng	I have to do that as soon as possible.
6246675	eng	Will Tom go to Boston next summer?
6246676	eng	Tom says he'd rather not do that today.
6246677	eng	I hate people who do things like that.
6246678	eng	Will Tom be doing that by himself?
6246679	eng	Tom says he wishes he hadn't done that.
6246680	eng	I hate it when people keep me waiting.
6246681	eng	Why don't you want to talk to Tom?
6246682	eng	Tom says he wants more money than that.
6246683	eng	I had to come to Boston for a meeting.
6246684	eng	Why does Tom want to go to Boston?
6246685	eng	Tom says he used to be able to do that.
6246686	eng	I had a headache, so I didn't do that.
6246687	eng	Why does Tom need to go to Boston?
6246688	eng	Tom says he thinks he needs to do that.
6246689	eng	I found the wallet I thought I'd lost.
6246690	eng	Why did you permit Tom to do that?
6246691	eng	Tom says he needs more money than that.
6246692	eng	I finally visited Boston last October.
6246693	eng	Why did Tom go to the supermarket?
6246694	eng	Tom says he hasn't done that in months.
6246695	eng	I doubt if it would be fun to do that.
6246696	eng	Why aren't you in Boston with Tom?
6246697	eng	Tom says he has about thirty cookbooks.
6246698	eng	I don't have many friends in Boston.
6246699	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't help us?
6246700	eng	Tom says he doesn't do that very often.
6246701	eng	I don't want you to do that right now.
6246702	eng	Who told you Tom wouldn't do that?
6246703	eng	Tom says he didn't know how to do that.
6246704	eng	I don't want to watch TV this evening.
6246705	eng	Who told you Tom had been injured?
6246706	eng	Tom says he could never live in Boston.
6246707	eng	I don't want to sing with you anymore.
6246708	eng	Who told you Tom couldn't do that?
6246709	eng	Tom said we shouldn't leave until 2:30.
6246710	eng	I don't want to make a fool of myself.
6246711	eng	Who did Tom say taught him French?
6246712	eng	Tom said three shots were fired in all.
6246713	eng	I don't want to have to do that again.
6246714	eng	When did Tom have his house built?
6246715	eng	Tom said there's a reason he does that.
6246716	eng	I don't want to cross the picket line.
6246717	eng	What did Tom do that was so wrong?
6246718	eng	Tom said the team needed a new captain.
6246719	eng	I don't want my friends to see me cry.
6246720	eng	They tell me that Tom can do that.
6246721	eng	Tom said the accident wasn't his fault.
6246722	eng	I don't want anything for my birthday.
6246723	eng	That won't make Tom sick, will it?
6246724	eng	Tom said that would likely happen soon.
6246725	eng	I don't think you're being reasonable.
6246726	eng	Should we tell Tom not to do that?
6246727	eng	Tom said that probably wouldn't happen.
6246728	eng	I don't think you should've done that.
6246729	eng	Please tell Tom to lock the doors.
6246730	eng	Tom said that he won't do that anymore.
6246731	eng	I don't think you should do that here.
6246732	eng	Please tell Tom to get here early.
6246733	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very impressed.
6246734	eng	I don't think you should buy that car.
6246735	eng	Please tell Tom that I'll do that.
6246736	eng	Tom said that he wasn't hungry anymore.
6246737	eng	I don't think doing that would be fun.
6246738	eng	Please tell Tom he should do that.
6246739	eng	Tom said that he wasn't having any fun.
6246740	eng	I don't think I've forgotten anything.
6246741	eng	Please tell Tom he has to do that.
6246742	eng	Tom said that he had fun at your party.
6246743	eng	I don't think I'll need too much help.
6246744	eng	Please tell Tom I need to do that.
6246745	eng	Tom said that could never happen again.
6246746	eng	I don't think I'll need any more help.
6246747	eng	Perhaps Tom would like to do that.
6246748	eng	Tom said some things will never change.
6246749	eng	I don't think I'll ever do that again.
6246750	eng	Perhaps Tom won't do that anymore.
6246751	eng	Tom said it was pretty easy to do that.
6246752	eng	I don't think I'll ever be happy here.
6246753	eng	Perhaps Tom will do that tomorrow.
6246754	eng	Tom said it was him who should do that.
6246755	eng	I don't think I'll be able to do that.
6246756	eng	Perhaps Tom wants to do that, too.
6246757	eng	Tom said it was him who had to do that.
6246758	eng	I don't think I'd have fun doing that.
6246759	eng	Perhaps Tom needs to do that, too.
6246760	eng	Tom said it snowed in Boston yesterday.
6246761	eng	I don't think I want to do that today.
6246762	eng	My wife told Tom I wasn't at home.
6246763	eng	Tom said his schedule has been changed.
6246764	eng	I don't think I should really do that.
6246765	eng	My guess is that Tom will do that.
6246766	eng	Tom said he's pleased with the results.
6246767	eng	I don't think I really had to do that.
6246768	eng	My car cost a lot more than Tom's.
6246769	eng	Tom said he's interested in doing that.
6246770	eng	I don't think I need to do that today.
6246771	eng	Maybe Tom is doing that right now.
6246772	eng	Tom said he's glad you weren't injured.
6246773	eng	I don't think I have to do that today.
6246774	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know where I am.
6246775	eng	Tom said he's been to Australia before.
6246776	eng	I don't think I can do that right now.
6246777	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what to do.
6246778	eng	Tom said he'd do that if I did it, too.
6246779	eng	I don't think I can do that by myself.
6246780	eng	Maybe I can go to Boston with Tom.
6246781	eng	Tom said he'd do that again, didn't he?
6246782	eng	I don't remember if I locked the door.
6246783	eng	It's not often that Tom does that.
6246784	eng	Tom said he'd be retiring next October.
6246785	eng	I don't remember if I did that or not.
6246786	eng	It wasn't easy for Tom to do that.
6246787	eng	Tom said he'd be in Boston next Monday.
6246788	eng	I don't really want to live in Boston.
6246789	eng	It sounds like Tom has to do that.
6246790	eng	Tom said he wouldn't forget that night.
6246791	eng	I don't quite remember when I did that.
6246792	eng	Is Tom still working as a plumber?
6246793	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't done that.
6246794	eng	I don't need to know why you did that.
6246795	eng	Is Tom still permitted to do that?
6246796	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't been late.
6246797	eng	I don't need to go to the store today.
6246799	eng	Tom said he wasn't the least bit tired.
6246800	eng	I don't need to go to school tomorrow.
6246801	eng	If you do that, Tom will be happy.
6246802	eng	Tom said he wasn't old enough to drive.
6246803	eng	I don't need to get up early tomorrow.
6246804	eng	I've persuaded Tom not to do that.
6246805	eng	Tom said he wasn't old enough to drink.
6246806	eng	I don't need to do that, but I should.
6246807	eng	I've never seen Tom wearing jeans.
6246808	eng	Tom said he wasn't a good chess player.
6246809	eng	I don't need to be at today's meeting.
6246810	eng	I'm the person Tom is waiting for.
6246811	eng	Tom said he was starting to feel dizzy.
6246812	eng	I don't mind if you don't wait for me.
6246813	eng	I'm sure Tom won't object to that.
6246814	eng	Tom said he was asked to do that again.
6246815	eng	I don't like to have my picture taken.
6246816	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be embarrassed.
6246817	eng	Tom said he wants to be a fire fighter.
6246818	eng	I don't know whether it's true or not.
6246819	eng	I'm sure Tom hasn't forgotten you.
6246820	eng	Tom said he wanted to be ready by 2:30.
6246821	eng	I don't know where to put my umbrella.
6246822	eng	I'm supposed to help Tom tomorrow.
6246823	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what to do.
6246824	eng	I don't know where the supermarket is.
6246825	eng	I'm really glad that Tom did that.
6246826	eng	Tom said he saw no point in doing that.
6246827	eng	I don't know how to ride a motorcycle.
6246828	eng	I'm not sure what Tom wants to do.
6246829	eng	Tom said he often thinks about leaving.
6246830	eng	I don't know how to play the clarinet.
6246831	eng	I'm not sure what Tom needs to do.
6246832	eng	Tom said he now regrets not doing that.
6246833	eng	I don't know how to get to your place.
6246834	eng	I'm certain that Tom will do that.
6246835	eng	Tom said he needs to borrow some money.
6246836	eng	I don't know how much money was taken.
6246837	eng	I'd never stay in Boston with Tom.
6246838	eng	Tom said he isn't the least bit hungry.
6246839	eng	I don't know how much money I'll need.
6246840	eng	I'd never seen Tom do that before.
6246841	eng	Tom said he hopes to keep working here.
6246842	eng	I don't know how I'm going to do that.
6246843	eng	I'd be willing to do that for Tom.
6246844	eng	Tom said he hopes to be back on Monday.
6246845	eng	I don't know exactly what I should do.
6246846	eng	I would've advised Tom to do that.
6246847	eng	Tom said he hoped to be back on Monday.
6246848	eng	I don't know any other way to do that.
6246849	eng	I wonder why Tom wants to do that.
6246850	eng	Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
6246851	eng	I don't know Mr. Jackson's first name.
6246852	eng	I wonder why Tom needs to do that.
6246853	eng	Tom said he enjoyed last night's party.
6246854	eng	I don't have to know why you did that.
6246855	eng	I wonder whether Tom will do that.
6246856	eng	Tom said he didn't want to get married.
6246857	eng	I don't have to go if I don't want to.
6246858	eng	I wonder what Tom is trying to do.
6246859	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that now.
6246860	eng	I don't have to get up early tomorrow.
6246861	eng	I wonder if Tom will be all right.
6246862	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do anything.
6246863	eng	I don't have to do that, but I should.
6246864	eng	I wonder if Tom is doing that now.
6246865	eng	Tom said he didn't want that to happen.
6246866	eng	I don't have to be at today's meeting.
6246867	eng	I wonder if Tom has done that yet.
6246868	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to help him.
6246869	eng	I don't have the willpower to do that.
6246870	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom anything.
6246871	eng	Tom said he didn't need any more money.
6246872	eng	I don't have the experience necessary.
6246873	eng	I wasn't the one who poisoned Tom.
6246874	eng	Tom said he didn't have anything to do.
6246875	eng	I don't have much teaching experience.
6246877	eng	Tom said he didn't get paid to do that.
6246878	eng	I don't have anything to do with that.
6246879	eng	I wasn't able to make Tom do that.
6246880	eng	Tom said he couldn't recall doing that.
6246881	eng	I don't have any friends to play with.
6246882	eng	I wasn't able to help Tom do that.
6246883	eng	Tom said doing that wouldn't be enough.
6246884	eng	I don't have a place to put my things.
6246885	eng	I was surprised that Tom did that.
6246886	eng	Tom said doing that would be too risky.
6246887	eng	I don't give my children an allowance.
6246888	eng	I was in the same hospital as Tom.
6246889	eng	Tom said doing that would be dangerous.
6246890	eng	I don't get paid very much to do that.
6246891	eng	I want to give my old desk to Tom.
6246892	eng	Tom said I wasn't permitted to do that.
6246893	eng	I don't do that kind of thing anymore.
6246894	eng	I told Tom you could speak French.
6246895	eng	Tom said I should've gone home earlier.
6246896	eng	I do that about three hours every day.
6246897	eng	I told Tom to do that immediately.
6246898	eng	Tom said I should never have done that.
6246899	eng	I didn't wear a tie to work yesterday.
6246900	eng	I thought that Tom didn't do that.
6246901	eng	Tom said I needed to get more exercise.
6246902	eng	I didn't want to get in trouble again.
6246903	eng	I thought it was Tom who did that.
6246904	eng	Tom said I don't need to do that today.
6246905	eng	I didn't want to answer that question.
6246906	eng	I thought Tom would be suspicious.
6246907	eng	Tom said I don't have to do that today.
6246908	eng	I didn't want things to end like this.
6246909	eng	I thought Tom would be safe there.
6246910	eng	Tom said I didn't sound very surprised.
6246911	eng	I didn't understand what was going on.
6246912	eng	I thought Tom would be reasonable.
6246913	eng	Tom said I didn't sound very confident.
6246914	eng	I didn't think that would ever happen.
6246915	eng	I thought Tom would be interested.
6246916	eng	Tom refuses to admit he made a mistake.
6246917	eng	I didn't think I had to do that today.
6246918	eng	I thought Tom would be frustrated.
6246919	eng	Tom really would've enjoyed this movie.
6246920	eng	I didn't tell the police my real name.
6246921	eng	I thought Tom should study harder.
6246922	eng	Tom really wants to do that by himself.
6246923	eng	I didn't tell anyone who I really was.
6246924	eng	I thought Tom should study French.
6246925	eng	Tom really needs to do that right away.
6246926	eng	I didn't swim because it was too cold.
6246927	eng	I thought Tom might be interested.
6246928	eng	Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
6246929	eng	I didn't stay in Boston for very long.
6246930	eng	I thought Tom knew how to do that.
6246931	eng	Tom really does look much better today.
6246932	eng	I didn't say anything about the party.
6246933	eng	I thought Tom had a chance to win.
6246934	eng	Tom really did that exceptionally well.
6246935	eng	I didn't recognize anyone in the room.
6246936	eng	I thought Tom could pass the test.
6246937	eng	Tom realized he didn't have to do that.
6246938	eng	I didn't really think I could do that.
6246939	eng	I thought I was doing Tom a favor.
6246940	eng	Tom put the cans of beans on the shelf.
6246941	eng	I didn't really expect this to happen.
6246942	eng	I think that Tom wants to do that.
6246943	eng	Tom promised to do that, but he didn't.
6246944	eng	I didn't really enjoy studying French.
6246945	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be surprised.
6246946	eng	Tom promised he wouldn't do that today.
6246947	eng	I didn't realize my nose was bleeding.
6246948	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be impressed.
6246949	eng	Tom promised he wouldn't do that again.
6246950	eng	I didn't realize I was being followed.
6246951	eng	I think Tom would need to do that.
6246952	eng	Tom probably won't be doing that today.
6246953	eng	I didn't read the newspaper yesterday.
6246954	eng	I think Tom would have to do that.
6246955	eng	Tom probably should do that right away.
6246956	eng	I didn't leave my apartment yesterday.
6246957	eng	I think Tom would hate to do that.
6246958	eng	Tom probably doesn't understand French.
6246959	eng	I didn't know you liked horror movies.
6246960	eng	I think Tom would be undependable.
6246961	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who did that.
6246962	eng	I didn't know you knew how to do that.
6246963	eng	I think Tom will do that tomorrow.
6246964	eng	Tom probably didn't do that by himself.
6246965	eng	I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
6246966	eng	I think Tom will be here tomorrow.
6246967	eng	Tom probably could've done that better.
6246968	eng	I didn't know what to do at that time.
6246969	eng	I think Tom really has to do that.
6246970	eng	Tom pretended that he had a broken leg.
6246971	eng	I didn't know what everyone else knew.
6246972	eng	I think Tom really had to do that.
6246973	eng	Tom plans to fly to Boston next Monday.
6246974	eng	I didn't know that you would be there.
6246975	eng	I think Tom isn't going to resign.
6246976	eng	Tom picked the knife up off the ground.
6246977	eng	I didn't know if I could do it or not.
6246978	eng	I think Tom is through doing that.
6246979	eng	Tom opened the door and let his dog in.
6246980	eng	I didn't know how much money I'd need.
6246981	eng	I think Tom is anxious to do that.
6246982	eng	Tom only speaks French when he's drunk.
6246983	eng	I didn't know how much money I needed.
6246984	eng	I think Tom can help us next week.
6246985	eng	Tom often did that when he was younger.
6246986	eng	I didn't know I was going to be fired.
6246987	eng	I teach French to Tom once a week.
6246988	eng	Tom never did that when he was younger.
6246989	eng	I didn't have time to read the report.
6246990	eng	I still haven't apologized to Tom.
6246991	eng	Tom needs to figure out how to do that.
6246992	eng	I didn't have anything I needed to do.
6246993	eng	I should've stayed and helped Tom.
6246994	eng	Tom needed to be in Boston last Monday.
6246995	eng	I didn't have a chance to do anything.
6246996	eng	I should've let Tom do that first.
6246997	eng	Tom must've had a good time doing that.
6246998	eng	I didn't go to French class yesterday.
6246999	eng	I should've called Tom last night.
6247000	eng	Tom must've been doing that last night.
6247001	eng	I didn't give the police my real name.
6247002	eng	I only did that to make Tom happy.
6247003	eng	Tom must've been determined to do that.
6247004	eng	I didn't feel like playing golf today.
6247005	eng	I only did that to make Tom angry.
6247006	eng	Tom might get punished if he does that.
6247007	eng	I didn't expect you to do that for me.
6247008	eng	I never knew that Tom was so rich.
6247009	eng	Tom may not be going to Boston with us.
6247010	eng	I didn't expect to be able to do that.
6247011	eng	I need to tell Tom not to do that.
6247012	eng	Tom may keep doing that if he wants to.
6247013	eng	I didn't do what I was supposed to do.
6247014	eng	I need to show Tom how to do that.
6247015	eng	Tom managed to do that without my help.
6247016	eng	I didn't do everything I needed to do.
6247017	eng	I live across the street from Tom.
6247018	eng	Tom lost three children in the bombing.
6247019	eng	I didn't buy what you asked me to buy.
6247020	eng	I learned how to do that from Tom.
6247021	eng	Tom likes watching late night TV shows.
6247022	eng	I didn't bring my tools with me today.
6247023	eng	I know that Tom shouldn't do that.
6247024	eng	Tom left his luggage at the front desk.
6247025	eng	I did that as soon as school was over.
6247026	eng	I know that Tom is very talkative.
6247027	eng	Tom knows he's not supposed to do that.
6247028	eng	I couldn't do that because I was sick.
6247029	eng	I know that Tom is self-conscious.
6247030	eng	Tom knows he shouldn't do that anymore.
6247031	eng	I couldn't do that because I was busy.
6247032	eng	I know that Tom has been arrested.
6247033	eng	Tom knows he isn't supposed to do that.
6247034	eng	I could do that if I really wanted to.
6247035	eng	I know exactly what Tom has to do.
6247036	eng	Tom knows he could've done that better.
6247037	eng	I can do that again if you want me to.
6247038	eng	I know Tom shouldn't do that here.
6247039	eng	Tom knows hardly anything about Boston.
6247040	eng	I can come with you if you want me to.
6247041	eng	I know Tom probably won't do that.
6247042	eng	Tom knew he wasn't supposed to do that.
6247043	eng	I can be persuasive when I want to be.
6247044	eng	I know Tom isn't going to do that.
6247045	eng	Tom kicked the ball with his left foot.
6247046	eng	I came to the same conclusion you did.
6247047	eng	I know Tom didn't want to do that.
6247048	eng	Tom isn't what he was thirty years ago.
6247049	eng	I came to Boston to try to find a job.
6247050	eng	I knew that Tom wanted to do that.
6247051	eng	Tom isn't very likely to do that again.
6247052	eng	I buy almost all the food we eat here.
6247053	eng	I knew that Tom needed to do that.
6247054	eng	Tom isn't the worst player on our team.
6247055	eng	I burn both wood and coal in my stove.
6247056	eng	I just can't believe Tom did that.
6247057	eng	Tom isn't permitted to do that anymore.
6247058	eng	I bought a house with a swimming pool.
6247059	eng	I hope that what Tom said is true.
6247060	eng	Tom isn't likely to promise to do that.
6247061	eng	I assume you wouldn't want to do that.
6247062	eng	I hope Tom isn't still unemployed.
6247063	eng	Tom isn't likely to forget his promise.
6247064	eng	I asked who wouldn't do that tomorrow.
6247065	eng	I hope Tom isn't still doing that.
6247066	eng	Tom isn't likely to be suspicious.
6247067	eng	I almost never do that in the evening.
6247068	eng	I hope Tom isn't going to do that.
6247069	eng	Tom isn't likely to be reasonable.
6247070	eng	I almost never come to Boston anymore.
6247071	eng	I hope Tom is through doing that.
6247072	eng	Tom isn't likely to be interested.
6247073	eng	How would you like to do that with me?
6247074	eng	I hope Tom doesn't try to do that.
6247075	eng	Tom isn't likely to be handcuffed.
6247076	eng	How often do you eat with your family?
6247077	eng	I hope Tom doesn't get frightened.
6247078	eng	Tom isn't likely to be frightened.
6247079	eng	How much water do you drink every day?
6247080	eng	I hope Tom can do that by himself.
6247081	eng	Tom isn't likely to be downstairs.
6247082	eng	How many years did it take to do that?
6247083	eng	I helped Tom out whenever I could.
6247084	eng	Tom isn't likely to be biased.
6247085	eng	How many weeks did it take to do that?
6247086	eng	I helped Tom get back on his feet.
6247087	eng	Tom isn't a member of our club anymore.
6247088	eng	How many times an hour do you do that?
6247089	eng	I helped Tom climb over the fence.
6247090	eng	Tom is usually the first one to arrive.
6247091	eng	How many times a week do you exercise?
6247092	eng	I heard that Tom wouldn't do that.
6247093	eng	Tom is the weakest singer in our choir.
6247094	eng	How many times a night do you do that?
6247095	eng	I heard that Tom wants to do that.
6247096	eng	Tom is the owner of a local restaurant.
6247097	eng	How many times a month do you eat out?
6247098	eng	I heard Tom will do that tomorrow.
6247099	eng	Tom is the only one who has to do that.
6247100	eng	How many times a month do you do that?
6247101	eng	I had a feeling Tom would do that.
6247102	eng	Tom is the only one who had to do that.
6247104	eng	I had a feeling Tom might do that.
6247105	eng	Tom is the only one here with red hair.
6247106	eng	How many pieces does this puzzle have?
6247107	eng	I forgot to remind Tom to do that.
6247108	eng	Tom is the only one here who has a car.
6247109	eng	How many loaves of bread did you bake?
6247110	eng	I feel sure that Tom will do that.
6247111	eng	Tom is the only one allowed to do that.
6247112	eng	How many hours did it take to do that?
6247113	eng	I expect Tom to do that on Monday.
6247114	eng	Tom is the only keyboard player I know.
6247115	eng	How many exams did you have last week?
6247116	eng	I expect Tom to be back on Monday.
6247117	eng	Tom is the one who should've done that.
6247118	eng	How many days will it take to do that?
6247119	eng	I doubt if Tom will do that again.
6247120	eng	Tom is the one who know how to do that.
6247121	eng	How many days does it take to do that?
6247122	eng	I doubt if Tom will be suspicious.
6247123	eng	Tom is the guy who tells us what to do.
6247124	eng	How many cookies were in this package?
6247125	eng	I doubt if Tom will be interested.

6247127	eng	How many classes do you have every week?
6247128	eng	I doubt if Tom will be frightened.
6247129	eng	Tom is the author of over thirty books.
6247130	eng	How long have you lived in this house?
6247131	eng	I doubt Tom will ever get married.
6247132	eng	Tom is supposed to be doing that today.
6247133	eng	How long have you been a student here?
6247134	eng	I doubt Tom really has to do that.
6247135	eng	Tom is still willing to do that for us.
6247136	eng	How long are we going to be in Boston?
6247137	eng	I don't want to tell Tom anything.
6247138	eng	Tom is still facing 30 years in prison.
6247139	eng	Have you ever bought a lottery ticket?
6247140	eng	I don't want to talk to Tom again.
6247141	eng	Tom is still a very good tennis player.
6247142	eng	Have you ever been to another country?
6247143	eng	I don't want to go to Tom's party.
6247144	eng	Tom is sick, so we can't do that today.
6247145	eng	Few people do that here in the winter.
6247146	eng	I don't want to go there with Tom.
6247147	eng	Tom is quite likely not doing that now.
6247148	eng	Even though I hate doing that, I will.
6247149	eng	I don't want Tom to know I'm rich.
6247150	eng	Tom is never as busy as the rest of us.
6247151	eng	Don't you want me to buy that for you?
6247152	eng	I don't want Tom to do what I did.
6247153	eng	Tom is making breakfast in the kitchen.
6247154	eng	Don't try to do that without our help.
6247155	eng	I don't want Tom to do that alone.
6247156	eng	Tom is lucky to still be in Boston now.
6247157	eng	Doing that would really make me happy.
6247158	eng	I don't want Tom to do that again.
6247159	eng	Tom is lucky to have such good friends.
6247160	eng	Doing that won't be as easy you think.
6247161	eng	I don't think that Tom was hungry.
6247162	eng	Tom is likely to be through doing that.
6247163	eng	Doing that was easier than I expected.
6247164	eng	I don't think that Tom is at home.
6247165	eng	Tom is likely to be tempted to do that.
6247166	eng	Doing that requires a lot of patience.
6247167	eng	I don't think Tom will be worried.
6247168	eng	Tom is likely to be anxious to do that.
6247169	eng	Doing that isn't good for your health.
6247170	eng	I don't think Tom will be nervous.
6247171	eng	Tom is leaving for Australia next week.
6247172	eng	Doing that is likely to be very tough.
6247173	eng	I don't think Tom will be jealous.
6247174	eng	Tom is in the kitchen peeling potatoes.
6247175	eng	Do your parents permit you to do that?
6247176	eng	I don't think Tom will be furious.
6247177	eng	Tom is in the kitchen making breakfast.
6247178	eng	Do you think you'd be able to do that?
6247179	eng	I don't think Tom was intoxicated.
6247180	eng	Tom is going to be lonely if you leave.
6247181	eng	Do you think it'll be colder tomorrow?
6247182	eng	I don't think Tom still does that.
6247183	eng	Tom is going swimming tomorrow morning.
6247184	eng	Do you think doing that would be safe?
6247185	eng	I don't think Tom really did that.
6247186	eng	Tom is faced with a difficult decision.
6247187	eng	Do you think I really have to do that?
6247188	eng	I don't think Tom is disappointed.
6247189	eng	Tom is expected to do that later today.
6247190	eng	Do you still live at the same address?
6247191	eng	I don't think Tom is ambidextrous.
6247192	eng	Tom is downstairs doing that right now.
6247193	eng	Do you really think I have to do that?
6247194	eng	I don't really think Tom did that.
6247195	eng	Tom is doing his best to not get angry.
6247196	eng	Do you mean you didn't really do that?
6247197	eng	I don't really care what Tom does.
6247198	eng	Tom is doing his best not to get angry.
6247199	eng	Do you know any better way to do that?
6247200	eng	I don't really care what Tom buys.
6247201	eng	Tom is definitely not going to do that.
6247202	eng	Do you have any idea what's happening?
6247203	eng	I don't like any of Tom's friends.
6247204	eng	Tom is certain to pass the examination.
6247205	eng	Do you have any experience doing that?
6247206	eng	I don't like Tom's idea very much.
6247207	eng	Tom is by far the smartest person here.
6247208	eng	Do you always watch TV in the evening?
6247209	eng	I don't know why Tom quit his job.
6247210	eng	Tom is apparently responsible for that.
6247211	eng	Do we have to stay in Boston all week?
6247212	eng	I don't know why Tom is in Boston.
6247213	eng	Tom is an important person around here.
6247214	eng	Didn't you used to be student of mine?
6247215	eng	I don't know why Tom got confused.
6247216	eng	Tom is an important member of our team.
6247217	eng	Didn't you know you shouldn't do that?
6247218	eng	I don't know where Tom's house is.
6247219	eng	Tom is always worrying about something.
6247220	eng	Didn't you know you needed to do that?
6247221	eng	I don't know when Tom will arrive.
6247222	eng	Tom is also the author of three novels.
6247223	eng	Didn't you know each other growing up?
6247224	eng	I don't know when Tom got married.
6247225	eng	Tom is almost always at home on Monday.
6247226	eng	Did you know what was going to happen?
6247227	eng	I don't know when Tom can do that.

6247316	eng	You're the one I want to talk to now.
6247317	eng	I didn't think Tom looked nervous.
6247318	eng	Tom has to be the first one to do that.

6247399	eng	Tom has been out of work since October.
6247400	eng	You think I could do that, don't you?
6247401	eng	I didn't expect anything from Tom.
6247402	eng	Tom has been living in Boston too long.
6247403	eng	You think I can't do that, don't you?

6247417	eng	Tom has been having trouble doing that.
6247418	eng	You still have to do that, don't you?
6247419	eng	I couldn't do that, but Tom could.
6247420	eng	Tom has been having a really hard time.
6247421	eng	You shouldn't have needed to do that.
6247422	eng	I borrowed this umbrella from Tom.
6247423	eng	Tom has been having a really good year.
6247424	eng	You should be done doing that by now.
6247425	eng	I believe it was Tom who did that.
6247426	eng	Tom has been getting better and better.
6247427	eng	You seemed surprised when I did that.

6247429	eng	Tom has been getting all the attention.
6247430	eng	You seem to be in a hurry to do that.

6247442	eng	You need to stay and help me do that.
6247443	eng	How long has Tom been in the cave?
6247444	eng	Tom has an umbrella just like that one.
6247445	eng	You need to find some way to do that.
6247446	eng	Don't you think Tom eats too much?
6247447	eng	Tom has also recorded as a solo artist.
6247448	eng	You need to be in Boston next Monday.
6247449	eng	Doing that with Tom should be fun.
6247450	eng	Tom has already given me what I wanted.
6247451	eng	You need to be a little more patient.
6247452	eng	Doing that doesn't make Tom happy.
6247453	eng	Tom has advised me to start doing that.
6247454	eng	You may do that again if you want to.
6247455	eng	Do you think that Tom can do that?

6247463	eng	You look a lot like your grandfather.
6247464	eng	Do you still see Tom every Monday?

6247466	eng	You have to stay and help me do that.
6247467	eng	Do you plan to permit Tom to do that?
6247468	eng	Tom hardly ever goes to Boston anymore.
6247469	eng	You have to find some way to do that.
6247470	eng	Do you know where Tom wants to go?
6247471	eng	Tom grabbed a hose and then called 911.
6247472	eng	You had all day to finish doing that.
6247473	eng	Do you know where Tom needs to go?

6247484	eng	You don't look like you're impressed.
6247485	eng	Didn't you know Tom would do that?
6247486	eng	Tom got exactly what he said he wanted.
6247487	eng	You don't look like you're exhausted.
6247488	eng	Didn't you know Tom was in Boston?

6247511	eng	You didn't look like you were scared.
6247512	eng	Did you know Tom was unhappy here?
6247513	eng	Tom gave me advice on which car to buy.

6247538	eng	You can't hear me very well, can you?

6247579	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be having much fun.
6247580	eng	Why do you need to stay after school?
6247581	eng	You shouldn't ask Tom to do that.
6247582	eng	Tom doesn't seem any busier than usual.
6247583	eng	Why do you always speak French to me?
6247584	eng	You should've done that with Tom.

6247586	eng	Why did you recommend not doing that?
6247587	eng	You promised to help Tom do that.
6247588	eng	Tom doesn't really want to do that now.
6247589	eng	Why did you need to be there by 2:30?
6247590	eng	You did that for Tom, didn't you?
6247591	eng	Tom doesn't really have to do that now.
6247592	eng	Who's going to be sitting next to me?
6247593	eng	Will Tom be permitted to do that?
6247594	eng	Tom doesn't permit his kids to do that.
6247595	eng	Who would be crazy enough to do that?
6247596	eng	Why would Tom speak French to me?
6247597	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that by himself.
6247598	eng	Who told you that you had to do that?
6247599	eng	Why don't you get Tom to do that?
6247600	eng	Tom doesn't need me to do that anymore.
6247601	eng	Who told you I'd knew how to do that?
6247602	eng	Why do you permit Tom to do that?
6247603	eng	Tom doesn't like being told to do that.
6247604	eng	Who do you plan to go to Boston with?
6247605	eng	Why did Tom want to go to Boston?
6247606	eng	Tom doesn't know who did that, does he?
6247607	eng	Where can I buy a pair of sunglasses?
6247608	eng	Why did Tom need to go to Boston?
6247609	eng	Tom doesn't know what he did was wrong.
6247610	eng	When do you plan to return to Boston?
6247611	eng	Why did Tom have to go to Boston?
6247612	eng	Tom doesn't know that I'm not Canadian.
6247613	eng	Whatever you do, don't lose this key.
6247614	eng	Who else went to Boston with Tom?
6247615	eng	Tom doesn't know that I don't like him.
6247616	eng	What's the best way to get to Boston?
6247617	eng	Which one of those cars is Tom's?
6247618	eng	Tom doesn't know how he should do that.
6247619	eng	What difference would that have made?
6247620	eng	Where do you suppose Tom will go?
6247621	eng	Tom doesn't know a lot about Australia.
6247622	eng	What color shoes do you usually wear?
6247623	eng	We're fortunate to have Tom here.
6247624	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that by himself.
6247625	eng	What are you going to do this summer?
6247626	eng	We need to contact Tom's parents.
6247627	eng	Tom doesn't have experience doing that.
6247628	eng	We've decided not to do that anymore.
6247629	eng	We can't count on Tom to do that.
6247630	eng	Tom doesn't have as much money as I do.
6247631	eng	We've been told not to do that again.
6247632	eng	We all encouraged Tom to do that.
6247633	eng	Tom doesn't feel like doing that today.
6247634	eng	We've been given several tasks to do.
6247635	eng	They say that Tom didn't do that.
6247636	eng	Tom doesn't expect to get here on time.
6247637	eng	We'll probably be in Boston all week.
6247638	eng	There's no way Tom would do that.
6247639	eng	Tom doesn't ever want to do that again.
6247640	eng	We won't be able to defend ourselves.
6247641	eng	The dogs started growling at Tom.
6247642	eng	Tom doesn't do that very often anymore.
6247643	eng	We were able to do that successfully.
6247644	eng	Tell me about Tom and his family.
6247645	eng	Tom doesn't do that the way he used to.
6247646	eng	We should've stayed in Boston longer.
6247647	eng	Tell Tom he has to do that today.
6247648	eng	Tom doesn't care that his car is dirty.
6247649	eng	We should've expected that to happen.
6247650	eng	Shouldn't Tom be at school today?
6247651	eng	Tom doesn't care if you do that or not.
6247652	eng	We should speak French to each other.
6247653	eng	Please tell Tom to lock the door.
6247654	eng	Tom does that at 2:30 almost every day.
6247655	eng	We should get out of here right away.
6247656	eng	Please tell Tom to do that later.
6247657	eng	Tom does that almost every day at 2:30.
6247658	eng	We need to hire a couple of janitors.
6247659	eng	Please tell Tom to buy some eggs.
6247660	eng	Tom does a lot of the household chores.
6247661	eng	We need to finish doing this by 2:30.
6247662	eng	Please tell Tom to bring a salad.
6247663	eng	Tom died three hours after he was born.
6247664	eng	We need to figure out how to do that.
6247665	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't speak French.
6247666	eng	Tom died three days after the accident.
6247667	eng	We don't often see ducks around here.
6247668	eng	Not all of Tom's jokes are funny.
6247669	eng	Tom died in a traffic accident in 2013.
6247670	eng	We don't have you to do that anymore.
6247671	eng	My dogs killed one of Tom's cats.
6247672	eng	Tom died in Boston on October 20, 2013.
6247673	eng	Very few people can actually do that.
6247674	eng	My birthday is the same as Tom's.
6247675	eng	Tom died before his third son was born.
6247676	eng	This seems to be a pretty nice place.
6247677	eng	Maybe Tom would enjoy doing that.
6247678	eng	Tom didn't want to throw anything away.
6247679	eng	This project is almost 100% complete.
6247680	eng	It's doubtful if Tom can do that.
6247681	eng	Tom didn't want to stay inside all day.
6247682	eng	This kind of heat isn't that unusual.
6247683	eng	It was probably Tom who did that.
6247684	eng	Tom didn't want to get his clothes wet.
6247685	eng	This kind of cold isn't that unusual.
6247686	eng	It looks as if Tom is doing that.
6247687	eng	Tom didn't want me to help him do that.
6247688	eng	These shoes aren't big enough for me.
6247689	eng	Is it true that Tom will do that?
6247690	eng	Tom didn't think that we could do that.
6247691	eng	There's something I want to give you.
6247692	eng	If Tom wants to do that, let him.
6247693	eng	Tom didn't tell you to do that, did he?
6247694	eng	There's something I need to give you.
6247695	eng	I've decided to help Tom do that.
6247696	eng	Tom didn't seem to know how to do that.
6247697	eng	There's something I have to show you.
6247698	eng	I'm sure Tom won't pass the exam.
6247699	eng	Tom didn't seem to be enjoying himself.
6247700	eng	There's something I have to give you.
6247701	eng	I'm sure Tom won't do that again.
6247702	eng	Tom didn't seem to be eager to do that.
6247703	eng	There's something I don't understand.
6247704	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be suspicious.
6247705	eng	Tom didn't seem to appreciate our gift.
6247706	eng	There's one more thing we need to do.
6247707	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be interested.
6247708	eng	Tom didn't look like he was in a hurry.
6247709	eng	There's one more thing we have to do.
6247710	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be handcuffed.
6247711	eng	Tom didn't look like he was having fun.
6247712	eng	There's no easy way out of this mess.
6247713	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be frightened.
6247714	eng	Tom didn't know where his friends were.
6247715	eng	There were thousands of people there.
6247716	eng	I'm sure Tom will be unimpressed.
6247717	eng	Tom didn't know that he had to do that.
6247718	eng	There was a lot of food on the table.
6247719	eng	I'm sure Tom will be sympathetic.
6247720	eng	Tom didn't know that I was from Boston.
6247721	eng	The teacher asked us a few questions.
6247722	eng	I'm sure Tom will be embarrassed.
6247723	eng	Tom didn't know how to open the drawer.
6247724	eng	The movie was better than I expected.
6247725	eng	I'm sure Tom will be cooperative.
6247726	eng	Tom didn't have the courage to do that.
6247727	eng	The last few days have been very hot.
6247728	eng	I'm sure Tom intended to do that.
6247729	eng	Tom didn't have a good time doing that.
6247730	eng	That store sells all kinds of things.
6247731	eng	I'm supposed to help Tom do that.
6247732	eng	Tom didn't go there, and neither did I.
6247733	eng	That probably won't happen next week.
6247734	eng	I'm reluctant to do that for Tom.
6247735	eng	Tom didn't give me a chance to do that.
6247737	eng	I'm glad that Tom didn't do that.
6247738	eng	Tom didn't even have time to eat lunch.
6247739	eng	Someone forced you to do that, right?
6247740	eng	I'm glad Tom was able to do that.
6247741	eng	Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
6247742	eng	Some businesses start out as hobbies.
6247743	eng	I'm about the same weight as Tom.
6247744	eng	Tom didn't do that and I didn't either.
6247745	eng	Please tell me when I should do that.
6247746	eng	I'm about the same height as Tom.
6247748	eng	Please remind me to do that tomorrow.
6247749	eng	I'll never go to Boston with Tom.
6247750	eng	Tom didn't come to Boston last weekend.
6247751	eng	Please put these flowers in the vase.
6247752	eng	I'll ask Tom to buy that for you.
6247753	eng	Tom didn't actually do that by himself.
6247754	eng	Please give me this one and this one.
6247755	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom did that.
6247756	eng	Tom did the same thing three years ago.
6247757	eng	Please give me this one and that one.
6247758	eng	I wouldn't go to Boston with Tom.
6247759	eng	Tom did that because he was ordered to.
6247760	eng	Please don't go to Boston without me.
6247761	eng	I wonder why Tom never does that.
6247762	eng	Tom did more than what we asked him to.
6247763	eng	Please don't be late for the meeting.
6247764	eng	I wonder whether Tom can do that.
6247765	eng	Tom did everything we wanted him to do.
6247766	eng	Perhaps you could borrow an umbrella.
6247767	eng	I wonder what Tom is reading now.
6247768	eng	Tom denies that he did that on purpose.
6247770	eng	I wonder if Tom will be punctual.
6247771	eng	Tom demonstrated how the device worked.
6247772	eng	Nobody wants to go to Boston with me.
6247773	eng	I wonder if Tom wants to do that.
6247774	eng	Tom definitely wouldn't have done that.
6247775	eng	My shift will be over in three hours.
6247776	eng	I wonder if Tom needs to do that.
6247777	eng	Tom definitely won't forget to do that.
6247778	eng	My parents weren't home last weekend.
6247779	eng	I wonder if Tom is a picky eater.
6247780	eng	Tom definitely won't do that this week.
6247781	eng	My parents wanted me to study French.
6247782	eng	I won't ask Tom to do that again.
6247783	eng	Tom definitely had a chance to do that.
6247784	eng	My parents are very worried about me.
6247785	eng	I wish Tom could've come with me.
6247786	eng	Tom definitely doesn't want to do that.
6247787	eng	My old car got thirty miles a gallon.
6247788	eng	I wasn't sure what Tom had to do.
6247789	eng	Tom definitely doesn't need to do that.
6247790	eng	My guitar is a lot better than yours.
6247791	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me.
6247792	eng	Tom definitely doesn't have to do that.
6247793	eng	My father won't permit me to do that.
6247794	eng	I was on the same bus as Tom was.
6247795	eng	Tom cut down the tree with a chain saw.
6247796	eng	My father made me sell my motorcycle.
6247797	eng	I wanted to go swimming with Tom.
6247798	eng	Tom couldn't talk me out of doing that.
6247799	eng	My doctor advised me to stop smoking.
6247800	eng	I want to see Tom try to do that.
6247801	eng	Tom couldn't go to Boston last weekend.
6247802	eng	My computer is much newer than yours.
6247803	eng	I want to know who Tom's wife is.
6247804	eng	Tom could've simply refused to do that.
6247805	eng	Monday will likely be a very hot day.
6247806	eng	I want to go to the zoo with Tom.
6247807	eng	Tom could've done that without my help.
6247808	eng	Mary says she'll wear the blue dress.
6247809	eng	I want to give my old car to Tom.
6247810	eng	Tom could've complained, but he didn't.
6247811	eng	Mary is the mother of three children.
6247812	eng	I want to get to know Tom better.
6247813	eng	Tom could get arrested if he does that.
6247814	eng	Let's go out to get something to eat.
6247815	eng	I told Tom I'd do that on Monday.
6247816	eng	Tom continues to deny that he did that.
6247817	eng	Just taste it and see if you like it.
6247818	eng	I thought Tom would be exhausted.
6247819	eng	Tom continued to do that until he died.
6247820	eng	Just make sure you get there on time.
6247821	eng	I thought Tom would be desperate.
6247822	eng	Tom continued doing that until he died.
6247823	eng	It's very crowded here in the summer.
6247824	eng	I thought Tom would be depressed.
6247825	eng	Tom continued doing that for some time.
6247826	eng	It's raining too hard to do that now.
6247827	eng	I thought Tom would be back soon.
6247828	eng	Tom comes to Boston every other Monday.
6247829	eng	It's hard to see the stage from here.
6247830	eng	I thought Tom was in big trouble.
6247831	eng	Tom claimed his wallet had been stolen.
6247832	eng	It's OK if I don't do that, isn't it?
6247833	eng	I thought Tom was doing that now.
6247834	eng	Tom changed his schedule to match mine.
6247835	eng	It'll take us a long time to do that.
6247836	eng	I thought Tom was being stubborn.
6247837	eng	Tom caught his son smoking a cigarette.
6247838	eng	It would've been romantic to do that.
6247839	eng	I thought Tom seemed unconcerned.
6247840	eng	Tom can't do that right now. He's busy.
6247841	eng	It would've been possible to do that.
6247842	eng	I thought Tom enjoyed doing that.
6247843	eng	Tom can keep doing that if he wants to.
6247844	eng	It would be very sensible to do that.
6247845	eng	I thought Tom did that yesterday.
6247846	eng	Tom can do that even better than I can.
6247847	eng	It would be very romantic to do that.
6247848	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be truthful.
6247849	eng	Tom can afford to buy the car he wants.
6247850	eng	It would be very reckless to do that.
6247851	eng	I think Tom would try to do that.
6247852	eng	Tom can afford to buy any car he wants.
6247853	eng	It would be unethical not to do that.
6247854	eng	I think Tom would like to retire.
6247855	eng	Tom became an orphan when he was three.
6247856	eng	It would be prudent to do that today.
6247857	eng	I think Tom would be unimpressed.
6247858	eng	Tom apparently doesn't want to do that.
6247859	eng	It would be irresponsible to do that.
6247860	eng	I think Tom would be sympathetic.
6247861	eng	Tom apparently doesn't need to do that.
6247862	eng	It would be inconsiderate to do that.
6247863	eng	I think Tom would be discouraged.
6247864	eng	Tom apparently doesn't have to do that.
6247865	eng	It would be foolish to do that again.
6247866	eng	I think Tom would be cooperative.
6247867	eng	Tom and I've been married thirty years.
6247868	eng	It would be disrespectful to do that.
6247869	eng	I think Tom won't be cooperative.
6247870	eng	Tom and I'll probably do that together.
6247871	eng	It would be dangerous to do that now.
6247872	eng	I think Tom will help me do that.
6247873	eng	Tom and I worked very closely together.
6247874	eng	It would be a mistake to do that now.
6247875	eng	I think Tom will be here by 2:30.
6247876	eng	Tom and I work at the same supermarket.
6247877	eng	It would be a big mistake to do that.
6247878	eng	I think Tom will be coming later.
6247879	eng	Tom and I weren't married at that time.
6247880	eng	It would be a bad mistake to do that.
6247881	eng	I think Tom knows how to do that.
6247882	eng	Tom and I were married for three years.
6247883	eng	It takes a lot of courage to do that.
6247884	eng	I think Tom did that pretty well.
6247885	eng	Tom and I were able to help each other.
6247886	eng	It should be safe for you to do that.
6247887	eng	I think Tom ate my piece of cake.
6247888	eng	Tom and I went to see a movie together.
6247889	eng	It should be easy for you to do that.
6247890	eng	I shouldn't have let Tom do that.
6247891	eng	Tom and I watched the sunrise together.
6247892	eng	It should be a lot of fun to do that.
6247893	eng	I should've told Tom to be quiet.
6247894	eng	Tom and I want to know what's going on.
6247895	eng	It seems like a good idea to do that.
6247896	eng	I should've asked Tom to do that.
6247897	eng	Tom and I very often do the same thing.
6247898	eng	It probably won't be safe to do that.
6247899	eng	I should tell Tom not to do that.
6247900	eng	Tom and I used to go swimming together.
6247901	eng	It probably won't be easy to do that.
6247902	eng	I should tell Tom how to do that.
6247903	eng	Tom and I used to go shopping together.
6247904	eng	It must be boring for you to do that.
6247905	eng	I should show Tom how to do that.
6247906	eng	Tom and I used to be business partners.
6247907	eng	It infuriates me when people do that.
6247908	eng	I should help Tom more than I do.
6247909	eng	Tom and I started talking at same time.
6247910	eng	It doesn't look like you're prepared.
6247911	eng	I should help Tom clean his room.
6247912	eng	Tom and I spend a lot of time together.
6247913	eng	It didn't look like you were shocked.
6247914	eng	I should have Tom do that for me.
6247915	eng	Tom and I posed for a picture together.
6247916	eng	It didn't look like you were annoyed.
6247917	eng	I remember asking Tom to do that.
6247918	eng	Tom and I often wear matching T-shirts.
6247919	eng	It could take a few hours to do that.
6247920	eng	I persuaded Tom to do that again.
6247921	eng	Tom and I live next door to each other.
6247922	eng	Isn't there any other way to do that?
6247923	eng	I ordered the same thing Tom did.
6247924	eng	Tom and I hugged and kissed each other.
6247925	eng	Isn't there an easier way to do that?
6247926	eng	I know why Tom wanted to do that.
6247927	eng	Tom and I have very different opinions.
6247928	eng	Isn't there a cheaper way to do that?
6247929	eng	I know why Tom shouldn't do that.
6247930	eng	Tom and I have three teenage daughters.
6247931	eng	Is it OK if I don't do that tomorrow?
6247932	eng	I know why Tom needed to do that.
6247933	eng	Tom and I have recently become friends.
6247934	eng	Is gold more expensive than platinum?
6247935	eng	I know what Tom's car looks like.
6247936	eng	Tom and I had a cup of coffee together.
6247937	eng	If you're sick, don't come to school.
6247938	eng	I know what I need to say to Tom.
6247939	eng	Tom and I got married three months ago.
6247940	eng	If you do that, it'll cause problems.
6247941	eng	I know what I have to say to Tom.
6247942	eng	Tom and I go to school on the same bus.
6247943	eng	I've stayed in Boston for three days.
6247944	eng	I know that you're afraid of Tom.
6247945	eng	Tom and I enjoy playing music together.
6247946	eng	I've only been to Boston three times.
6247947	eng	I know that Tom wants to do that.

6248223	eng	I don't know very much about Tom.
6248224	eng	Tom tried doing that, but he couldn't.
6248225	eng	I should've sent a letter of apology.
6248226	eng	I don't know how much Tom weighs.

6248239	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't do that again.
6248240	eng	I should've done that someplace else.
6248241	eng	I don't care what happens to Tom.
6248242	eng	Tom told me he had trouble doing that.
6248243	eng	I should've been ready, but I wasn't.
6248244	eng	I don't allow Tom to go out much.
6248245	eng	Tom told himself that he should leave.
6248246	eng	I should try to do that, shouldn't I?
6248247	eng	I don't agree with what Tom said.
6248248	eng	Tom thought he didn't need to do that.
6248249	eng	I should have someone do that for me.
6248250	eng	I didn't work as hard as Tom did.
6248251	eng	Tom thought he didn't have to do that.
6248252	eng	I should do that as soon as possible.
6248253	eng	I didn't want to sit next to Tom.
6248254	eng	Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
6248255	eng	I should be the first one to do that.
6248256	eng	I didn't want to do that for Tom.
6248257	eng	Tom thinks he's pretty good at guitar.
6248258	eng	I should be out of the hospital soon.
6248259	eng	I didn't think that Tom was cute.

6248264	eng	I promised you I'd do that, didn't I?
6248265	eng	I didn't think Tom would kiss me.
6248266	eng	Tom thinks he doesn't have to do that.
6248267	eng	I probably could've done that better.
6248268	eng	I didn't think Tom would hurt me.
6248270	eng	I pretended I didn't know what to do.
6248271	eng	I didn't think Tom would be late.
6248272	eng	Tom talked with his friends yesterday.
6248273	eng	I now know why I should've done that.
6248274	eng	I didn't think Tom would be last.
6248275	eng	Tom suggested we do that by ourselves.
6248276	eng	I never said I wanted to go with you.
6248277	eng	I didn't think Tom would be here.
6248278	eng	Tom suggested that we do that quickly.
6248279	eng	I might not stay in Boston very long.
6248280	eng	I didn't think Tom was surprised.

6248318	eng	I knew doing that would be a mistake.
6248319	eng	I didn't like what Tom was doing.
6248320	eng	Tom started doing that a few days ago.
6248321	eng	I knew I might be allowed to do that.
6248322	eng	I didn't know why Tom was so sad.
6248323	eng	Tom spoke for less than three minutes.
6248324	eng	I hope you get the chance to do that.
6248325	eng	I didn't know why Tom was absent.

6248327	eng	I hope you don't get hurt doing that.
6248328	eng	I didn't know where Tom had gone.

6248353	eng	Tom smiled and said he was doing fine.
6248354	eng	I feel responsible for what happened.
6248355	eng	I didn't know Tom was your uncle.
6248356	eng	Tom showed me various ways to do that.
6248357	eng	I expect you to do the same thing I did.
6248358	eng	I didn't know Tom was a Canadian.
6248359	eng	Tom showed me several ways to do that.
6248360	eng	I enjoy listening to classical music.
6248361	eng	I didn't know Tom had to do that.
6248362	eng	Tom shouldn't be too hard to convince.
6248363	eng	I doubt if it would be OK to do that.
6248364	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't do that.
6248365	eng	Tom shouldn't be permitted to do that.
6248366	eng	I doubt I'll ever be able to do that.
6248367	eng	I didn't hear Tom enter the room.
6248368	eng	Tom should've stayed in Boston longer.
6248369	eng	I don't want to try to do that again.
6248370	eng	I didn't give Tom what he wanted.

6248378	eng	I don't want to live in an apartment.
6248379	eng	I didn't do anything to help Tom.
6248380	eng	Tom should've been willing to do that.
6248381	eng	I don't want to go swimming with you.
6248382	eng	I didn't ask Tom where he'd gone.
6248383	eng	Tom should've been tempted to do that.
6248384	eng	I don't want to go drinking with you.
6248385	eng	I didn't ask Tom for his opinion.
6248386	eng	Tom should've been fired last October.
6248387	eng	I don't want to get in trouble again.
6248388	eng	I didn't accept Tom's invitation.

6248390	eng	I don't want anything to do with you.
6248391	eng	I can't stop Tom from doing that.
6248392	eng	Tom should have a good time in Boston.
6248393	eng	I don't think you're being realistic.
6248394	eng	I can do that without Tom's help.
6248395	eng	Tom should go home and think about it.
6248396	eng	I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
6248397	eng	I bet Tom could help you do that.
6248398	eng	Tom should be the next one to do that.
6248399	eng	I don't think that's such a big deal.
6248400	eng	I asked Tom why I should do that.
6248401	eng	Tom should be the last one to do that.
6248402	eng	I don't think that actually happened.
6248403	eng	I asked Tom why I had to do that.
6248404	eng	Tom should be the captain of our team.
6248405	eng	I don't think that I need to do that.
6248406	eng	I always stay with Tom in Boston.
6248407	eng	Tom should be ready for the challenge.
6248408	eng	I don't think doing that would be OK.
6248409	eng	I already know what Tom is doing.
6248410	eng	Tom should be forgiven for doing that.
6248411	eng	I don't think doing that is much fun.
6248412	eng	I already know what Tom has done.

6248421	eng	How often does Tom go to parties?

6248424	eng	How often does Tom get a haircut?
6248425	eng	Tom should be able to do that as well.

6248427	eng	How many times has Tom done that?
6248428	eng	Tom sent those emails three hours ago.
6248429	eng	I don't really have to do that today.

6248445	eng	I don't need to worry about anything.
6248446	eng	Everyone listened to Tom's story.
6248447	eng	Tom seemed to be reluctant to do that.
6248448	eng	I don't need to wear glasses anymore.
6248449	eng	Even Tom doesn't want to do that.
6248450	eng	Tom seemed to be doing that very well.
6248451	eng	I don't need to know all the details.
6248452	eng	Doing that didn't make Tom happy.
6248453	eng	Tom seemed to be an easy-going person.
6248454	eng	I don't need to go to school anymore.
6248455	eng	Do you think Tom will be excited?

6248582	eng	Tom said that he'd been very careless.
6248583	eng	I didn't want to answer the question.
6248584	eng	When Tom does that, let me know.
6248585	eng	Tom said that he'd be glad to do that.

6248663	eng	Tom said he'd help if I wanted him to.
6248664	eng	I didn't have anything to write with.
6248665	eng	Perhaps Tom is writing a letter.
6248666	eng	Tom said he'd be back on October 20th.
6248667	eng	I didn't have a good time doing that.
6248668	eng	Perhaps Tom has to do that, too.
6248669	eng	Tom said he wouldn't enjoy doing that.
6248670	eng	I didn't go into the room right away.
6248671	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't read novels.
6248672	eng	Tom said he wouldn't agree to do that.
6248673	eng	I didn't get paid for the work I did.
6248674	eng	One of Tom's legs was amputated.
6248675	eng	Tom said he wasn't worried about that.
6248676	eng	I didn't get home in time for dinner.
6248677	eng	My first French teacher was Tom.
6248678	eng	Tom said he wasn't willing to help us.
6248679	eng	I didn't get enough sleep last night.
6248680	eng	My dog killed one of Tom's cats.
6248681	eng	Tom said he wasn't old enough to vote.
6248682	eng	I didn't get along with my neighbors.
6248683	eng	Maybe Tom would like to do that.
6248684	eng	Tom said he wasn't interested in that.
6248685	eng	I didn't follow the proper procedure.
6248686	eng	Maybe Tom wants to do that, too.
6248687	eng	Tom said he wasn't at home last night.
6248688	eng	I didn't find what I was looking for.
6248689	eng	Maybe Tom needs to do that, too.
6248690	eng	Tom said he was very unlikely to do that.
6248691	eng	I didn't feel I was ready to do that.
6248692	eng	Let's not permit Tom to do that.
6248693	eng	Tom said he was too stupid to do that.
6248694	eng	I didn't expect to be chosen captain.
6248695	eng	Let's ask Tom to do that for us.
6248696	eng	Tom said he was too sleepy to do that.
6248697	eng	I didn't expect this to happen today.
6248698	eng	Let Tom watch whatever he wants.
6248699	eng	Tom said he was told to do that again.
6248700	eng	I didn't enjoy the concert very much.
6248701	eng	Let Tom watch anything he wants.
6248702	eng	Tom said he was sorry for what he did.
6248703	eng	I didn't do what you wanted me to do.
6248704	eng	Let Tom listen to what he wants.
6248705	eng	Tom said he was just about to do that.
6248706	eng	I didn't do everything you say I did.
6248707	eng	Let Tom drink whatever he wants.
6248708	eng	Tom said he was in no rush to do that.
6248709	eng	I did the same thing three years ago.
6248710	eng	Let Tom drink anything he wants.
6248711	eng	Tom said he wanted to help us do that.
6248712	eng	I did that today the way I always do.
6248713	eng	It's possible that Tom did that.
6248714	eng	Tom said he wanted to buy another car.
6248715	eng	I did exactly the same thing you did.
6248717	eng	Tom said he wanted to be an architect.
6248718	eng	I definitely won't forget to do that.
6248719	eng	It seems that Tom won't do that.
6248720	eng	Tom said he thought you would do that.
6248721	eng	I couldn't have done that any better.
6248722	eng	It seems that Tom might do that.
6248723	eng	Tom said he thought he had to do that.
6248724	eng	I can't remember where I bought this.
6248725	eng	It looks like Tom won't do that.
6248726	eng	Tom said he really regrets doing that.
6248727	eng	I can't play the saxophone very well.
6248728	eng	Is Tom still willing to do that?
6248729	eng	Tom said he probably wouldn't do that.
6248730	eng	I can't play the piano all that well.
6248731	eng	Is Tom still obliged to do that?
6248732	eng	Tom said he now regrets that decision.
6248733	eng	I can't play the accordion very well.
6248735	eng	Tom said he never considered retiring.
6248736	eng	I can't lend you any money right now.
6248737	eng	Is Tom still allowed to do that?
6248738	eng	Tom said he needed to call the police.
6248739	eng	I can't do that now because I'm busy.
6248741	eng	Tom said he knows both of the victims.
6248742	eng	I can't believe that really happened.
6248743	eng	I've never met Tom's first wife.
6248744	eng	Tom said he knew it was time to leave.
6248745	eng	I assume you'd be willing to do that.
6248746	eng	I'm three months older than Tom.
6248747	eng	Tom said he isn't the least bit tired.
6248748	eng	How often do you practice basketball?
6248749	eng	I'm sure that Tom can't do that.
6248750	eng	Tom said he hopes to change that soon.
6248751	eng	How often do you do that by yourself?
6248752	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be surprised.
6248753	eng	Tom said he hopes that'll happen soon.
6248754	eng	How many ways do you know to do that?
6248755	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be ready yet.
6248756	eng	Tom said he hasn't decided what to do.
6248757	eng	How many times a year do you do that?
6248758	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be impressed.
6248759	eng	Tom said he has to do that by himself.
6248760	eng	How many times a week do you do that?
6248761	eng	I'm sure Tom will still do that.
6248762	eng	Tom said he had to do that by himself.
6248763	eng	How many slices of pizza did you eat?
6248764	eng	I'm sure Tom will pass the exam.
6248765	eng	Tom said he felt like he was dreaming.
6248766	eng	How many loaves of bread did you buy?
6248767	eng	I'm sure Tom will be suspicious.
6248768	eng	Tom said he felt compelled to do that.
6248769	eng	How many hours a week do you do that?
6248770	eng	I'm sure Tom will be reasonable.
6248771	eng	Tom said he doesn't care if I do that.
6248772	eng	How many days did it take to do that?
6248773	eng	I'm sure Tom will be interested.
6248774	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to do that.
6248775	eng	How long do you plan to be in Boston?
6248776	eng	I'm sure Tom will be handcuffed.
6248777	eng	Tom said he didn't want any more help.
6248778	eng	How far is the post office from here?
6248779	eng	I'm sure Tom will be frightened.
6248780	eng	Tom said he didn't need any more help.
6248781	eng	How did you know what I needed to do?
6248782	eng	I'm positive Tom didn't do that.
6248783	eng	Tom said he didn't know all the rules.
6248784	eng	How did you know I needed to do that?
6248785	eng	I'm not sure what Tom has to do.
6248786	eng	Tom said he didn't do that on purpose.
6248787	eng	How did you get to Boston so quickly?
6248788	eng	I'm going to ask Tom for advice.
6248789	eng	Tom said he didn't do that by himself.
6248790	eng	Have you finished writing the report?
6248791	eng	I'm exactly the same age as Tom.
6248792	eng	Tom said he didn't believe it himself.
6248793	eng	Have you ever taken a taxi to school?
6248794	eng	I'll do that if Tom wants me to.
6248795	eng	Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
6248796	eng	Have you ever run in a marathon race?
6248797	eng	I'd rather not do that with Tom.
6248798	eng	Tom said he believed he could do that.
6248799	eng	Have you ever fallen asleep in class?
6248800	eng	I wondered if Tom would do that.
6248801	eng	Tom said he assumed you would do that.
6248802	eng	Everything seems to be running smoothly.
6248803	eng	I wonder why Tom has to do that.
6248804	eng	Tom said a neighbor called the police.
6248805	eng	Everyone asked why you weren't there.
6248806	eng	I wonder why Tom had to do that.
6248807	eng	Tom said I needed to be there by 2:30.
6248808	eng	Everybody stayed in Boston except me.
6248809	eng	I wonder why Tom got suspicious.
6248810	eng	Tom returned from Australia yesterday.
6248811	eng	Don't forget to tell Mary to do that.
6248812	eng	I wonder if Tom was embarrassed.
6248813	eng	Tom recommended this dictionary to me.
6248814	eng	Don't forget to remind me to do that.
6248815	eng	I wonder if Tom is still single.
6248816	eng	Tom really has a lot of people fooled.
6248817	eng	Doing that wouldn't be very much fun.
6248818	eng	I wonder if Tom is disappointed.
6248819	eng	Tom puts a lot of sugar in his coffee.
6248820	eng	Doing that won't likely be very easy.
6248821	eng	I wonder if Tom can be discreet.
6248822	eng	Tom promised not to lie to me anymore.
6248823	eng	Doing that won't be as fun as you think.
6248824	eng	I wonder how Tom went to Boston.
6248825	eng	Tom promised he wouldn't do that here.
6248826	eng	Doing that likely won't be very easy.
6248827	eng	I won't tell Tom how to do that.
6248828	eng	Tom promised he won't do that anymore.
6248829	eng	Doing that likely won't be dangerous.
6248830	eng	I wish Tom would come to Boston.
6248831	eng	Tom probably won't forget his promise.
6248832	eng	Doing that isn't as easy as it looks.
6248833	eng	I wish Tom could do that better.
6248834	eng	Tom probably won't ever do that again.
6248835	eng	Doing it that way would be dangerous.
6248836	eng	I wish I'd kissed Tom goodnight.
6248837	eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that.
6248838	eng	Do you want to go to a movie with me?
6248839	eng	I wish I hadn't let Tom kiss me.
6248840	eng	Tom probably shouldn't have done that.
6248841	eng	Do you think you're a healthy person?
6248842	eng	I wish I hadn't hit Tom so hard.
6248843	eng	Tom probably should start packing now.
6248844	eng	Do you think it'll be muggy tomorrow?
6248845	eng	I wish I hadn't argued with Tom.
6248846	eng	Tom probably isn't mad at you anymore.
6248847	eng	Do you think it'll be humid tomorrow?
6248848	eng	I wish I had told Tom the truth.
6248849	eng	Tom probably fell asleep at the wheel.
6248850	eng	Do you think it'll be foggy tomorrow?
6248851	eng	I went swimming, but Tom didn't.
6248852	eng	Tom probably didn't do that last week.
6248853	eng	Do you think I'll be able to do that?
6248854	eng	I wasn't the one who kissed Tom.
6248855	eng	Tom probably did that on October 20th.
6248856	eng	Do you think I'd have fun doing that?
6248857	eng	I wasn't the one who killed Tom.
6248858	eng	Tom probably can't do that on his own.
6248859	eng	Do you still go sailing every summer?
6248860	eng	I wasn't the one who helped Tom.
6248861	eng	Tom pretty much gets what he asks for.
6248862	eng	Do you still enjoy watching baseball?
6248863	eng	I wasn't invited to Tom's party.
6248864	eng	Tom plays the saxophone, but not well.
6248865	eng	Do you see any harm in me doing that?
6248866	eng	I was surprised by what Tom did.
6248867	eng	Tom plans to live in Boston next year.
6248868	eng	Do you know where your father is now?
6248869	eng	I was supposed to meet Tom here.
6248870	eng	Tom passed away peacefully last night.
6248871	eng	Do you know any safer way to do that?
6248872	eng	I was on the same flight as Tom.
6248873	eng	Tom passed away at his home in Boston.
6248874	eng	Do you know Mr. Jackson's first name?
6248875	eng	I wanted to go skating with Tom.
6248876	eng	Tom owns a summer home near the beach.
6248877	eng	Do you intend to do that by yourself?
6248878	eng	I wanted to go camping with Tom.
6248879	eng	Tom overslept and was late for school.
6248880	eng	Didn't you know where I wanted to go?
6248881	eng	I wanted Tom to help me do that.
6248882	eng	Tom often wears a hat just like yours.
6248883	eng	Didn't I tell you I wouldn't do that?
6248884	eng	I want to know why Tom did that.
6248885	eng	Tom often complains about the weather.
6248886	eng	Did you remember to put out the fire?
6248887	eng	I want to know how Tom did that.
6248888	eng	Tom offered his seat to the old woman.
6248889	eng	Did you practice the piano yesterday?
6248890	eng	I understand that Tom does that.
6248891	eng	Tom obviously didn't enjoy doing that.
6248892	eng	Did you know that your door was open?
6248893	eng	I told Tom you'd come to Boston.
6248894	eng	Tom no longer speaks French to anyone.
6248895	eng	Did you actually do that by yourself?
6248896	eng	I told Tom what I wanted to eat.
6248897	eng	Tom never told me about his childhood.
6248898	eng	Could I have a glass of orange juice?
6248899	eng	I told Tom what I wanted to buy.
6248900	eng	Tom never received a formal education.
6248901	eng	Can you tell me what you tried to do?
6248902	eng	I told Tom what I needed to buy.
6248903	eng	Tom never really felt like doing that.
6248904	eng	Can you tell me exactly what you did?
6248905	eng	I told Tom that I can't do that.
6248906	eng	Tom never missed a game or a practice.
6248907	eng	Boston is sure a great place to live.
6248908	eng	I told Tom I'd be there by 2:30.
6248909	eng	Tom needs to make some decisive moves.
6248910	eng	Are you sure you're ready to do that?
6248911	eng	I thought you said Tom did that.
6248912	eng	Tom needs to be in Boston next Monday.
6248913	eng	Are you still considering doing that?
6248914	eng	I thought Tom would be punctual.
6248915	eng	Tom needs to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6248916	eng	Are you still a kindergarten teacher?
6248917	eng	I thought Tom wasn't interested.
6248918	eng	Tom must've thought he had to do that.
6248919	eng	Are you going to go by car or by bus?
6248920	eng	I thought Tom was wearing a wig.
6248921	eng	Tom must've been reluctant to do that.
6248922	eng	Are there many art museums in Boston?
6248923	eng	I thought Tom shouldn't do that.
6248924	eng	Tom must've been motivated to do that.
6248925	eng	Am I the only one who has to do that?
6248926	eng	I thought Tom seemed unfriendly.
6248927	eng	Tom must've been desperate to do that.
6248928	eng	About how many hours did you do that?
6248929	eng	I thought Tom didn't have a dog.
6248930	eng	Tom must be amused by what's going on.
6248931	eng	A lot of things can happen in a year.
6248932	eng	I thought Tom didn't have a car.
6248933	eng	Tom moved to Boston after his divorce.
6248934	eng	Your name will be added to the list.
6248935	eng	I think that Tom went to Boston.
6248936	eng	Tom missed the train by three minutes.
6248937	eng	Your hat has fallen under the table.
6248938	eng	I think that Tom didn't do that.
6248939	eng	Tom might have a good time doing that.
6248940	eng	You've seen me do that, haven't you?
6248941	eng	I think Tom would be suspicious.
6248942	eng	Tom may be living in Boston next year.
6248943	eng	You've quit doing that, haven't you?
6248944	eng	I think Tom would be reasonable.
6248945	eng	Tom may be coming to Boston next week.
6248946	eng	You're too old to apply for the job.
6248947	eng	I think Tom would be interested.
6248948	eng	Tom mainly painted portraits of women.
6248949	eng	You're the tallest boy in the class.
6248950	eng	I think Tom would be frightened.
6248951	eng	Tom made up his mind to go to college.
6248952	eng	You're the tallest boy in our class.
6248953	eng	I think Tom would be displeased.
6248954	eng	Tom made the most of his small income.
6248955	eng	You're the right person for the job.
6248956	eng	I think Tom won't be interested.
6248957	eng	Tom looked like he was in a good mood.
6248958	eng	You're the person I was waiting for.
6248959	eng	I think Tom won't be here today.
6248960	eng	Tom lives in a small hut in the woods.
6248961	eng	You're the only person who did that.
6248962	eng	I think Tom won't be doing that.
6248963	eng	Tom lives alone in a very large house.
6248964	eng	You're the one who needs to do that.
6248965	eng	I think Tom will do that for us.
6248966	eng	Tom likes what you're doing right now.
6248967	eng	You're going to do that, aren't you?
6248968	eng	I think Tom will do that for me.
6248969	eng	Tom likes to talk about his childhood.
6248970	eng	You're free to do whatever you want.
6248971	eng	I think Tom will be unimpressed.
6248972	eng	Tom likes spending time in the garden.
6248973	eng	You're free to do anything you want.
6248974	eng	I think Tom will be sympathetic.
6248975	eng	Tom likely won't be back anytime soon.
6248976	eng	You're a trumpet player, aren't you?
6248977	eng	I think Tom will be heartbroken.
6248978	eng	Tom let me know that he had done that.
6248979	eng	You're a fairly decent chess player.
6248980	eng	I think Tom will be discouraged.
6248981	eng	Tom left the room and closed the door.
6248982	eng	You're a careful driver, aren't you?
6248983	eng	I think Tom will be cooperative.
6248984	eng	Tom left the hospital three hours ago.
6248985	eng	You're a bit of a sissy, aren't you?
6248986	eng	I think Tom should've done that.
6248987	eng	Tom lay on his bed with his eyes open.
6248988	eng	You're a bit of a rebel, aren't you?
6248990	eng	Tom later apologized for his comments.
6248991	eng	You're a bit of a loner, aren't you?
6248992	eng	I think Tom is likely to resign.
6248993	eng	Tom knows where every light switch is.
6248994	eng	You're a French teacher, aren't you?
6248995	eng	I think Tom is eager to do that.
6248996	eng	Tom knows how to handle the situation.
6248997	eng	You'll do that on Monday, won't you?
6248998	eng	I think Tom is being reasonable.
6248999	eng	Tom knows he's not likely to be fired.
6249000	eng	You'd be able to do that, wouldn't you?
6249001	eng	I think Tom is back from Boston.
6249002	eng	Tom knows he no longer has to do that.
6249003	eng	You won't get the chance to do that.
6249004	eng	I think Tom has to go to Boston.
6249005	eng	Tom knows exactly what he ought to do.
6249006	eng	You were very courageous to do that.
6249007	eng	I think Tom had to go to Boston.
6249008	eng	Tom knows exactly what he needs to do.
6249009	eng	You were fussy when you were a baby.
6249010	eng	I think Tom didn't go to Boston.
6249011	eng	Tom knows exactly what has to be done.
6249012	eng	You thought I'd do that, didn't you?
6249013	eng	I think Tom did the right thing.
6249014	eng	Tom knows absolutely nothing about it.
6249015	eng	You still don't like Boston, do you?
6249016	eng	I think Tom did that in October.
6249017	eng	Tom knows a lot about classical music.
6249018	eng	You shouldn't be the one doing that.
6249019	eng	I think Tom did that by himself.
6249020	eng	Tom knows I'm not very happy about it.
6249021	eng	You should've done that last summer.
6249022	eng	I think Tom could do that today.
6249023	eng	Tom knew he had made the right choice.
6249024	eng	You should've done that by yourself.
6249025	eng	I suppose that Tom will do that.
6249026	eng	Tom knew he could've done that better.
6249027	eng	You should try doing that once more.
6249028	eng	I should've offered to help Tom.
6249029	eng	Tom just wants to stay out of the way.
6249030	eng	You seem to be unwilling to do that.

6249397	eng	My dog and I sleep in the same room.
6249398	eng	I didn't know why Tom was upset.
6249399	eng	Tom has said he won't do that anymore.
6249400	eng	My bicycle is much newer than yours.
6249401	eng	I didn't know why Tom was tired.
6249402	eng	Tom has said he wants to write a book.
6249403	eng	My bedroom is not as clean as yours.
6249404	eng	I didn't know what Tom would do.
6249405	eng	Tom has really helped a lot of people.
6249406	eng	My French is actually not very good.
6249407	eng	I didn't know that Tom was here.
6249408	eng	Tom has promised to do that this week.
6249409	eng	Most people here can't speak French.
6249410	eng	I didn't know that Tom loved me.
6249411	eng	Tom has promised not to do that again.
6249412	eng	Most of my hens lay one egg per day.
6249413	eng	I didn't know that Tom hated me.
6249414	eng	Tom has probably taught French before.
6249415	eng	Monday will probably be a windy day.
6249416	eng	I didn't know that Tom did that.
6249417	eng	Tom has plenty of friends to help him.
6249418	eng	Monday will probably be a rainy day.
6249419	eng	I didn't know how to answer Tom.
6249420	eng	Tom has painted himself into a corner.
6249421	eng	Mary isn't my wife. She's my sister.
6249422	eng	I didn't know Tom would do that.
6249423	eng	Tom has only recently moved to Boston.
6249424	eng	Mary and her husband live in Boston.
6249425	eng	I didn't know Tom was your boss.
6249426	eng	Tom has one year left on his contract.
6249427	eng	Let's try to do that again tomorrow.
6249428	eng	I didn't know Tom had done that.
6249429	eng	Tom has no close friends to talk with.
6249430	eng	Let's do that together tomorrow, OK?
6249431	eng	I didn't know I had to help Tom.
6249432	eng	Tom has never permitted me to do that.
6249433	eng	Let me see what I can do about that.
6249434	eng	I didn't keep my promise to Tom.
6249435	eng	Tom has never been to another country.
6249436	eng	Let me pay my share of the expenses.
6249437	eng	I didn't invite Tom to my party.
6249438	eng	Tom has more than three hundred books.
6249439	eng	It's really cold here in the winter.
6249440	eng	I didn't go and neither did Tom.
6249441	eng	Tom has me to show him how to do that.
6249442	eng	It's little too late to do that now.
6249443	eng	I didn't expect to see Tom here.
6249444	eng	Tom has made that same mistake before.
6249445	eng	It'll take a lot of time to do that.
6249446	eng	I didn't buy Tom what he said he wanted.
6249447	eng	Tom has lost at least three kilograms.
6249448	eng	It'll probably be unsafe to do that.
6249449	eng	I didn't buy Tom what he said he needed.
6249450	eng	Tom has lived in Australia since 2013.
6249451	eng	It'll probably be tiring to do that.
6249452	eng	I didn't ask Tom to wait for us.
6249453	eng	Tom has lived here for his whole life.
6249454	eng	It'll probably be boring to do that.
6249455	eng	I didn't ask Tom not to do that.
6249456	eng	Tom has his reasons for staying there.
6249457	eng	It'd be better if we didn't do that.
6249458	eng	I did that the same way Tom did.
6249459	eng	Tom has helped me out countless times.
6249460	eng	It would've been foolish to do that.
6249461	eng	I came here to do that with Tom.
6249462	eng	Tom has had plenty of time to do that.
6249463	eng	It would be very logical to do that.
6249464	eng	I can't swim as well as Tom can.
6249465	eng	Tom has had health problems for years.
6249466	eng	It would be stupid to do that again.
6249467	eng	I can't sing as well as Tom can.
6249468	eng	Tom has given each child three apples.
6249469	eng	It would be nice if I could do that.
6249470	eng	I can't prove that Tom did that.
6249471	eng	Tom has done what you asked him to do.
6249472	eng	It would be fun to do that with you.
6249473	eng	I bet Tom could do that for you.
6249474	eng	Tom has done what we wanted him to do.
6249475	eng	It would be a lot of fun to do that.
6249476	eng	I begged Tom to help me do that.
6249477	eng	Tom has done something similar before.
6249478	eng	It will likely be cold this weekend.
6249479	eng	I always knew Tom could do that.
6249480	eng	Tom has decided to go a different way.
6249481	eng	It was quite easy for me to do that.
6249482	eng	I already know why Tom did that.
6249483	eng	Tom has decided it's time to move out.
6249484	eng	It was a problem, but not a big one.
6249485	eng	How often does Tom have parties?
6249486	eng	Tom has been told he needs to do that.
6249487	eng	It should be very simple to do that.
6249488	eng	How often does Tom go to school?
6249489	eng	Tom has been to every state in the US.
6249490	eng	It should be interesting to do that.
6249491	eng	How often does Tom go to Boston?
6249492	eng	Tom has been to Australia three times.
6249493	eng	It probably won't be fun to do that.
6249494	eng	How many times will Tom do that?
6249495	eng	Tom has been teaching for three years.
6249496	eng	It may sound strange, but it's true.
6249497	eng	How many sandwiches did Tom eat?
6249498	eng	Tom has been sick in bed since Monday.
6249499	eng	It doesn't look like you're worried.
6249500	eng	How many brothers does Tom have?
6249501	eng	Tom has been named interim head coach.
6249502	eng	It doesn't look like you're pleased.
6249503	eng	How long has Tom been in prison?
6249504	eng	Tom has been late every day this week.
6249505	eng	It doesn't look like you're nervous.
6249506	eng	How badly was Tom's car damaged?
6249507	eng	Tom has been in this situation before.
6249508	eng	It didn't look like you were asleep.
6249509	eng	Has Tom come to Boston recently?
6249510	eng	Tom has been here for at least a year.
6249511	eng	Isn't there a faster way to do that?
6249512	eng	Has Tom been to Boston recently?
6249513	eng	Tom has been given a tough assignment.
6249514	eng	Isn't there a better way to do that?
6249515	eng	Has Tom already left for Boston?
6249516	eng	Tom has been doing that the whole day.
6249517	eng	Is it possible to cross this bridge?
6249518	eng	Even Tom went to Boston with us.
6249519	eng	Tom has been doing that since October.
6249520	eng	If you like, I can buy that for you.
6249521	eng	Even Tom didn't want to do that.
6249522	eng	Tom has been caught doing that before.
6249523	eng	I've never seen a bear in this area.
6249524	eng	Even Tom didn't know what to do.
6249525	eng	Tom has been blamed for what happened.
6249526	eng	I've never done that, not even once.
6249527	eng	Either I'll do that or Tom will.
6249528	eng	Tom has been asking me the same thing.
6249529	eng	I've never been to Australia before.
6249530	eng	Doing that would make Tom happy.
6249531	eng	Tom has been arrested on drug charges.
6249532	eng	I've moved out of my parent's house.
6249533	eng	Do you want Tom to go to Boston?
6249534	eng	Tom has been a really good role model.
6249535	eng	I've made up my mind not to do that.
6249536	eng	Do you think Tom will be absent?
6249537	eng	Tom has been a firefighter since 2013.
6249538	eng	I've got some experience doing that.
6249539	eng	Do you think Tom went to Boston?
6249540	eng	Tom has become an electrical engineer.
6249542	eng	Do you think Tom might be wrong?
6249544	eng	I've decided to try to do that here.
6249545	eng	Do you think Tom might be early?
6249546	eng	Tom has always wanted to study French.
6249547	eng	I've decided not to do that anymore.
6249548	eng	Do you think Tom might be drunk?
6249549	eng	Tom has always wanted to learn French.
6249550	eng	I've been trying to do that all day.
6249551	eng	Do you think Tom might be bored?
6249552	eng	Tom has always been really good to me.
6249553	eng	I've been told not to do that again.
6249554	eng	Do you think Tom might be awake?
6249555	eng	Tom has already done that three times.
6249556	eng	I've been doing that a lot recently.
6249557	eng	Do you think Tom might be angry?
6249558	eng	Tom has almost as many stamps as I do.
6249559	eng	I've always wanted a red sports car.
6249560	eng	Do you remember if Tom did that?
6249561	eng	Tom has agreed not to do that anymore.
6249562	eng	I've already sent in my application.
6249563	eng	Do you know why Tom was unhappy?
6249564	eng	Tom has advised me to stop doing that.
6249565	eng	I'm too old to start doing that now.
6249566	eng	Do you know where Tom has to go?
6249567	eng	Tom has a very strange sense of humor.
6249568	eng	I'm thinking of doing that tomorrow.
6249569	eng	Didn't you know Tom was unhappy?
6249570	eng	Tom has a very special way to do that.
6249571	eng	I'm thinking about moving to Boston.
6249572	eng	Didn't you know Tom was married?
6249573	eng	Tom has three handsome teenage sons.
6249574	eng	I'm thinking about going to college.
6249575	eng	Didn't you know Tom loves pizza?
6249576	eng	Tom has a hard time remembering names.
6249577	eng	I'm thinking about buying a new car.
6249578	eng	Did you know Tom would be there?
6249579	eng	Tom has a good chance of being chosen.
6249580	eng	I'm the only one who has to do that.
6249581	eng	Did you know Tom was doing that?
6249582	eng	Tom has a brother who works in a bank.
6249583	eng	I'm the only one allowed to do that.
6249584	eng	Did you know Tom was a Canadian?
6249585	eng	Tom had three sons who became doctors.
6249586	eng	I'm still not very good at swimming.
6249587	eng	Did you know Tom had to do that?
6249588	eng	Tom had plenty of reason to celebrate.
6249589	eng	I'm still not very fluent in French.
6249590	eng	Did Tom say he'd stay in Boston?
6249591	eng	Tom had many opportunities to do that.
6249592	eng	I'm sorry I didn't buy that for you.
6249593	eng	Did Tom say he stayed in Boston?
6249594	eng	Tom had an operation on his right leg.
6249595	eng	I'm not sure I want to get involved.
6249596	eng	Did Tom go somewhere last night?
6249597	eng	Tom had a similar accident in October.
6249598	eng	I'm not supposed to do that anymore.
6249599	eng	Did Tom come to Boston with you?
6249600	eng	Tom had a lot to do with that project.
6249601	eng	I'm not planning to do that anymore.
6249602	eng	Did I do something to upset Tom?
6249603	eng	Tom had a lot of things he had to buy.
6249604	eng	I'm not permitted to do that either.
6249605	eng	Can't you go to Boston with Tom?
6249606	eng	Tom graduated from law school in 2013.
6249607	eng	I'm not going to study French today.
6249608	eng	Can Tom come to Boston with you?
6249609	eng	Tom got up an hour early this morning.
6249610	eng	I'm good at both French and English.
6249611	eng	Both of Tom's brothers did that.
6249612	eng	Tom got a chance to do that last week.
6249613	eng	I'm going to have to do that myself.
6249614	eng	Ask Tom when he'll go to Boston.
6249615	eng	Tom frequently does that before lunch.
6249616	eng	I'm afraid I can't help you do that.
6249617	eng	Ask Tom to go to Boston for you.
6249618	eng	Tom freaked out and started screaming.
6249619	eng	I'll print out the schedule for you.
6249620	eng	Ask Tom if he'll stay in Boston.
6249621	eng	Tom found it hard not to be impressed.
6249622	eng	I'll do that if you pay me to do it.
6249623	eng	As far as I know, Tom does that.
6249624	eng	Tom finds fault with everything I say.
6249625	eng	I'll do that at least one more time.
6249626	eng	Are you sure Tom went to Boston?
6249627	eng	Tom fell in love with a younger woman.
6249628	eng	I'll be very careful when I do that.
6249629	eng	Are you sure Tom has to do that?
6249630	eng	Tom faces up to three years in prison.
6249632	eng	You're a lot older than Tom is.
6249633	eng	Tom faces charges of attempted murder.
6249634	eng	I'd like to buy a pair of ski boots.
6249635	eng	You're a little older than Tom.
6249636	eng	Tom expressed his thanks to all of us.
6249637	eng	I'd hoped I'd be allowed to do that.
6249638	eng	You'd defend Tom, wouldn't you?
6249639	eng	Tom explained why he couldn't do that.
6249640	eng	I wouldn't want to be seen together.
6249641	eng	You'd better not tell Tom that.
6249642	eng	Tom expects to go home in a few weeks.
6249643	eng	I wouldn't mind helping you do that.
6249644	eng	You shouldn't do that with Tom.
6249645	eng	Tom eventually quit trying to do that.
6249646	eng	I wouldn't mind buying that for you.
6249647	eng	You should tell Tom to do that.
6249648	eng	Tom escaped soon after being captured.
6249649	eng	I wouldn't have the guts to do that.
6249650	eng	You said you'd do that for Tom.
6249651	eng	Tom enjoys doing that with his family.
6249652	eng	I wouldn't ever consider doing that.
6249653	eng	You promised Tom you'd do that.
6249654	eng	Tom emptied everything out of the box.
6249655	eng	I wouldn't even consider doing that.
6249656	eng	Would it be OK if Tom did that?
6249657	eng	Tom drove a school bus for many years.
6249658	eng	I wonder if it's OK to do that here.
6249659	eng	Would Tom be afraid to do that?
6249660	eng	Tom doesn't want to repaint his house.
6249661	eng	I wonder if doing that would be fun.
6249662	eng	Will you speak French with Tom?
6249663	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that right now.
6249664	eng	I won't permit you to do that again.
6249665	eng	Will you permit Tom to do that?
6249666	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that every day.
6249667	eng	I won't likely try to do that again.
6249668	eng	Will Tom do that tomorrow, too?
6249669	eng	Tom doesn't want to be doing that now.
6249670	eng	I won't be going to Boston with you.
6249671	eng	Will Tom be willing to do that?
6249672	eng	Tom doesn't turn thirty until October.
6249673	eng	I won't be allowed to do that again.
6249674	eng	Will Tom be doing that anymore?
6249675	eng	Tom doesn't think you're able do that.
6249676	eng	I won't be able to make you do that.
6249677	eng	Why shouldn't Tom go to Boston?
6249678	eng	Tom doesn't think you need to do that.
6249680	eng	Why shouldn't Tom be in Boston?
6249681	eng	Tom doesn't think you have to do that.
6249682	eng	I wish we had the chance to do that.
6249683	eng	Why don't you do that with Tom?
6249684	eng	Tom doesn't think that we can do that.
6249685	eng	I wish that I could play the guitar.
6249686	eng	Why do you have to go to Tom's?
6249687	eng	Tom doesn't think he ought to do that.
6249688	eng	I wish someone would do that for me.
6249689	eng	Why didn't Tom want to do that?
6249690	eng	Tom doesn't think he needs to do that.
6249691	eng	I wish I'd had more time to do that.
6249692	eng	Why didn't Tom need to do that?
6249693	eng	Tom doesn't think I'd want to do that.
6249694	eng	I wish I'd eaten more for breakfast.
6249695	eng	Why didn't Tom have to do that?
6249696	eng	Tom doesn't think I did that, does he?
6249697	eng	I wish I hadn't parked my car there.
6249698	eng	Who told you that Tom did that?
6249699	eng	Tom doesn't take anything for granted.
6249700	eng	I wish I hadn't done that by myself.
6249701	eng	Who told you Tom would help us?
6249702	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know who did that.
6249703	eng	I wish I had enough money to retire.
6249704	eng	Who told you Tom would do that?
6249705	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be very concerned.
6249706	eng	I wish I could dance as well as you.
6249707	eng	Who told you Tom was in Boston?
6249708	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be afraid anymore.
6249709	eng	I was just getting ready to do that.
6249710	eng	Who told you Tom could do that?
6249711	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be a student here.
6249712	eng	I wanted to show you how to do that.
6249713	eng	Who told you Tom broke his leg?
6249714	eng	Tom doesn't see why he should do that.
6249715	eng	I wanted to do that, but I couldn't.
6249716	eng	When did Tom decide to do that?
6249717	eng	Tom doesn't really know what happened.
6249718	eng	I want to see you riding a unicycle.
6249719	eng	We should get out of Tom's way.
6249720	eng	Tom doesn't realize what he has to do.
6249721	eng	I want to know who you want to hire.
6249722	eng	We don't permit Tom to do that.
6249723	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that every day.
6249724	eng	I want to figure out how to do that.
6249725	eng	Was Tom watching TV last night?
6249726	eng	Tom doesn't like to read on the train.
6249727	eng	I want to buy some books for my son.
6249728	eng	Was Tom really able to do that?
6249729	eng	Tom doesn't like the way you did that.
6249730	eng	I want to be an electrical engineer.
6249731	eng	Those sunglasses belong to Tom.
6249732	eng	Tom doesn't know what he needs to buy.
6249733	eng	I usually get home just before 2:30.
6249734	eng	They say that Tom will do that.
6249735	eng	Tom doesn't know that I won't do that.
6249736	eng	I thought you would want to do that.
6249737	eng	The way Tom did that was wrong.
6249738	eng	Tom doesn't know how to throw a party.
6249739	eng	I thought you said I had to do that.
6249740	eng	That's the reason Tom did that.
6249741	eng	Tom doesn't know how to read or write.
6249742	eng	I thought we'd outsmarted everybody.
6249743	eng	That'll probably impress Tom.
6249744	eng	Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
6249745	eng	I thought I'd be doing that all day.
6249746	eng	Tell Tom to take off his shoes.
6249747	eng	Tom doesn't have very much experience.
6249748	eng	I thought I could get that for free.
6249749	eng	Please tell Tom not to do that.
6249750	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that every day.
6249751	eng	I thought I could do that by myself.
6249752	eng	Please make sure Tom does that.
6249753	eng	Tom doesn't have the skill to do that.
6249754	eng	I think you should do that tomorrow.
6249755	eng	Perhaps Tom won't go to Boston.
6249756	eng	Tom doesn't have the money to do that.
6249757	eng	I think that I've done that already.
6249758	eng	Perhaps Tom will come tomorrow.
6249759	eng	Tom doesn't have the means to do that.
6249760	eng	I think it might be easy to do that.
6249761	eng	Perhaps Tom wanted to buy that.
6249762	eng	Tom doesn't have as much time as I do.
6249763	eng	I think I'd be miserable doing that.
6249764	eng	Perhaps Tom is reading a novel.
6249765	eng	Tom doesn't have any living relatives.
6249766	eng	I suspect you don't have to do that.
6249767	eng	One of Tom's leg was amputated.
6249768	eng	Tom doesn't get paid a lot to do that.
6249769	eng	I still haven't planted any lettuce.
6249770	eng	No one knows why Tom is scared.
6249771	eng	Tom doesn't feel enough is being done.
6249772	eng	I still haven't finished doing that.
6249773	eng	My coffee cup is next to Tom's.
6249774	eng	Tom doesn't ever speak French anymore.
6249775	eng	I still have many friends in Boston.
6249776	eng	My car is parked next to Tom's.
6249777	eng	Tom doesn't even care that we're here.
6249778	eng	I still have a house on Park Street.
6249779	eng	Maybe Tom won't finish on time.
6249780	eng	Tom doesn't eat anything except bread.
6249781	eng	I still don't know how to tie a tie.
6249782	eng	Let's have Tom do that for you.
6249783	eng	Tom doesn't do that because he's sick.
6249784	eng	I shouldn't have taken off my shirt.
6249785	eng	Let Tom read whatever he wants.
6249786	eng	Tom doesn't do that anywhere but here.
6249787	eng	I should've refused to go to Boston.
6249788	eng	Let Tom read anything he wants.
6249789	eng	Tom doesn't come to school very often.
6249790	eng	I should've gone to Boston with you.
6249791	eng	Let Tom have whatever he wants.
6249792	eng	Tom does things that I'd refuse to do.
6249793	eng	I should've done things differently.
6249794	eng	Let Tom have anything he wants.
6249795	eng	Tom does that every day in the summer.
6249796	eng	I should've been with you yesterday.
6249797	eng	It's too late to visit Tom now.
6249798	eng	Tom died on his way back to Australia.
6249799	eng	I should've at least offered to pay.
6249800	eng	It's strange that Tom did that.
6249801	eng	Tom died on a visit to Boston in 2013.
6249802	eng	I should probably not do that today.
6249803	eng	It looks like Tom will do that.
6249804	eng	Tom died in 2013 after a long illness.
6249805	eng	I should have no problem doing that.
6249806	eng	It looks like Tom is shivering.
6249807	eng	Tom died from a drug overdose in 2013.
6249808	eng	I should get someone do that for me.
6249809	eng	Is Tom still unable to do that?
6249810	eng	Tom died Monday in his home in Boston.
6249811	eng	I should be the next one to do that.
6249812	eng	Is Tom still likely to do that?
6249813	eng	Tom died Monday at his home in Boston.
6249814	eng	I should be able to do that for you.
6249815	eng	Is Tom still afraid to do that?
6249816	eng	Tom didn't want to get into the water.
6249817	eng	I regret that I wasted so much time.
6249818	eng	Is Tom really living in Boston?
6249819	eng	Tom didn't want to be helped at first.
6249820	eng	I realized I didn't need to do that.
6249821	eng	I've warned Tom not to do that.
6249822	eng	Tom didn't want me to do that for him.
6249823	eng	I realized I didn't have to do that.
6249824	eng	I've never seen Tom doing that.
6249825	eng	Tom didn't think he needed to do that.
6249826	eng	I realize I don't have enough money.
6249827	eng	I've never seen Tom cry before.
6249828	eng	Tom didn't tell us what happened next.
6249829	eng	I plan to stay in Boston for a week.
6249830	eng	I've looked for Tom everywhere.
6249831	eng	Tom didn't tell me he knew my brother.
6249832	eng	I plan to have a party next weekend.
6249833	eng	I'm willing to do that for Tom.
6249834	eng	Tom didn't seem too surprised, either.
6249835	eng	I often study French in the evening.
6249836	eng	I'm sure that's what Tom wants.
6249837	eng	Tom didn't seem to know where to park.
6249838	eng	I'm sure that's what Tom needs.
6249839	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very happy here.
6249840	eng	I need to study for tomorrow's test.
6249841	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be punished.
6249842	eng	Tom didn't seem to be having much fun.
6249843	eng	I need to figure out how to do that.
6249844	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be prepared.
6249845	eng	Tom didn't seem any busier than usual.
6249846	eng	I might be able to buy that for you.
6249847	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be arrested.
6249848	eng	Tom didn't look very happy to see you.
6249849	eng	I met him, but I don't know his name.
6249850	eng	I'm sure Tom will visit Boston.
6249851	eng	Tom didn't know where his car key was.
6249852	eng	I may be living in Boston next year.
6249853	eng	I'm sure Tom will go to Boston.
6249854	eng	Tom didn't know that I had to do that.
6249855	eng	I looked at the calendar on my desk.
6249856	eng	I'm sure Tom will be terrified.
6249857	eng	Tom didn't know how he should do that.
6249858	eng	I learned how to do that in October.
6249859	eng	I'm sure Tom will be suspended.
6249860	eng	Tom didn't have to do that right away.
6249861	eng	I know that you're eager to do that.
6249862	eng	I'm sure Tom will be surprised.
6249863	eng	Tom didn't have time to do that today.
6249864	eng	I know that you hardly ever do that.
6249865	eng	I'm sure Tom will be skeptical.
6249866	eng	Tom didn't have money to buy anything.
6249867	eng	I know that you don't often do that.
6249868	eng	I'm sure Tom will be objective.
6249869	eng	Tom didn't even remember his own name.
6249870	eng	I know that I'm sometimes obstinate.
6249871	eng	I'm sure Tom will be depressed.
6249872	eng	Tom didn't even ask for my permission.
6249873	eng	I know that I'm sometimes obnoxious.
6249874	eng	I'm sure Tom will be concerned.
6249875	eng	Tom didn't do what you told him to do.
6249876	eng	I know it'll be possible to do that.
6249877	eng	I'm positive Tom won't do that.
6249878	eng	Tom didn't do that on purpose, did he?
6249879	eng	I know how much you hate doing that.
6249880	eng	I'm positive Tom speaks French.
6249881	eng	Tom did whatever he felt he had to do.
6249882	eng	I know I wasn't supposed to do that.
6249883	eng	I'm not sure that Tom did that.
6249884	eng	Tom did what he promised to do for me.
6249885	eng	I knew I wasn't supposed to do that.
6249886	eng	I'll talk to Tom when he comes.
6249887	eng	Tom did that today for the first time.
6249888	eng	I hope to finish doing this by 2:30.
6249889	eng	I'll ask Tom to do that for me.
6249890	eng	Tom did that the day before yesterday.
6249891	eng	I hope that I'll be able to do that.
6249892	eng	I'd never allow Tom to do that.
6249893	eng	Tom did that because he was forced to.
6249894	eng	I hope that I don't have to do that.
6249895	eng	I'd like Tom to do that for me.
6249896	eng	Tom did that because he had no choice.
6249897	eng	I hope I have the chance to do that.
6249898	eng	Tom did everything we asked him to do.
6249899	eng	I helped my mother fold the laundry.
6249900	eng	I wonder why Tom won't do that.
6249901	eng	Tom did everything he felt like doing.
6249902	eng	I heard that you did that yesterday.
6249903	eng	I wonder who taught Tom French.
6249904	eng	Tom deserves our respect and our help.
6249905	eng	I haven't done that very many times.
6249906	eng	I wonder when Tom will do that.
6249907	eng	Tom denies involvement in the bombing.
6249908	eng	I have trouble understanding French.
6249909	eng	I wonder what Tom wanted to do.
6249910	eng	Tom definitely wants to do that again.
6249911	eng	I have to tell my parents the truth.
6249912	eng	I wonder what Tom needed to do.
6249913	eng	Tom definitely looks better this week.
6249914	eng	I have to figure out how to do that.
6249915	eng	I wonder if Tom is trustworthy.
6249916	eng	Tom definitely didn't want to do that.
6249917	eng	I have no desire to do that anymore.
6249918	eng	I wonder if Tom is sympathetic.
6249919	eng	Tom definitely didn't need to do that.
6249920	eng	I had some business to take care of.
6249921	eng	I wonder if Tom is intoxicated.
6249922	eng	Tom definitely didn't have to do that.
6249923	eng	I had nothing to do, so I went home.
6249924	eng	I wonder if Tom has to do that.
6249925	eng	Tom decided to try doing that himself.
6249926	eng	I had intended to do that yesterday.
6249927	eng	I wonder if Tom can be trusted.
6249928	eng	Tom decided to let me do that for him.
6249929	eng	I go to the same school that you do.
6249930	eng	I won't have to tell Tom again.
6249931	eng	Tom decided to go ahead with his plan.
6249932	eng	I get up at the same time every day.
6249933	eng	I won't be doing that with Tom.
6249934	eng	Tom cut a picture out of the magazine.
6249935	eng	I found the keys I thought I'd lost.
6249936	eng	I wish Tom knew how to do that.
6249937	eng	Tom crouched down to avoid being seen.
6249938	eng	I find it very difficult to do that.
6249939	eng	I was going to do that for Tom.
6249940	eng	Tom crossed the river in a small boat.
6249941	eng	I feel a little better this morning.
6249942	eng	I wanted to go skiing with Tom.
6249943	eng	Tom couldn't move the desk by himself.
6249944	eng	I eventually found out who did that.
6249945	eng	I wanted to go hiking with Tom.
6249946	eng	Tom couldn't do that even if he tried.
6249947	eng	I don't wear glasses, but I used to.
6249948	eng	I want to learn more about Tom.
6249949	eng	Tom could've received a life sentence.
6249950	eng	I don't want you to stop doing that.
6249951	eng	I want to go shopping with Tom.
6249952	eng	Tom could've done that, but he didn't.
6249953	eng	I don't want to stay inside all day.
6249954	eng	I waited for Tom all afternoon.
6249955	eng	Tom could still face criminal charges.
6249956	eng	I don't want to rely on anyone else.
6249957	eng	I told Tom what you want to do.
6249958	eng	Tom could probably do that on his own.
6249959	eng	I don't want to move back to Boston.
6249960	eng	I told Tom what I needed to do.
6249961	eng	Tom could probably do that by himself.
6249962	eng	I don't want to lose any more money.
6249963	eng	I told Tom not to go to Boston.
6249964	eng	Tom could get punished if he did that.
6249965	eng	I don't want to live in the country.
6249966	eng	I told Tom I'd do that for him.
6249967	eng	Tom could be the first one to do that.
6249968	eng	I don't want to go to bed right now.
6249969	eng	I thought Tom would be worried.
6249970	eng	Tom could be interested in doing that.
6249971	eng	I don't want to go to Boston by bus.
6249972	eng	I thought Tom would be nervous.
6249974	eng	I don't want to go there after dark.
6249975	eng	I thought Tom would be jealous.
6249976	eng	Tom composed the music for that movie.
6249977	eng	I don't want to go sailing with you.
6249978	eng	I thought Tom would be grouchy.
6249979	eng	Tom comes to see me from time to time.
6249980	eng	I don't want to go camping with you.
6249981	eng	I thought Tom would be furious.
6249982	eng	Tom comes here once a week to help me.
6249983	eng	I don't want to eat leftovers again.
6249984	eng	I thought Tom would be careful.
6249985	eng	Tom comes from a very artistic family.
6249986	eng	I don't want to drink anything else.
6249987	eng	I thought Tom would be at home.
6249988	eng	Tom comes back to Boston every summer.
6249989	eng	I don't want to discuss the details.
6249990	eng	I thought Tom wasn't surprised.
6249991	eng	Tom climbed up the tree like a monkey.
6249992	eng	I don't want to answer the question.
6249993	eng	I thought Tom wasn't in Boston.
6249994	eng	Tom claims he never wanted to do that.
6249995	eng	I don't want my parents to find out.
6249996	eng	I thought Tom wasn't impressed.
6249997	eng	Tom claimed nothing was done about it.
6249998	eng	I don't want a party on my birthday.
6249999	eng	I thought Tom was making it up.
6250000	eng	Tom certainly wasn't ready to do that.
6250001	eng	I don't understand French very well.
6250002	eng	I thought Tom seemed impressed.
6250003	eng	Tom carried our suitcases to our room.
6250004	eng	I don't think this makes much sense.
6250005	eng	I thought Tom must be mistaken.
6250006	eng	Tom can't play the clarinet very well.
6250007	eng	I don't think this is a coincidence.
6250008	eng	I thought Tom looked exhausted.
6250009	eng	Tom came to the station to see me off.
6250010	eng	I don't think there is life on Mars.
6250011	eng	I thought I could count on Tom.
6250012	eng	Tom came to the same conclusion I did.
6250013	eng	I don't think that I should do that.
6250014	eng	I think that Tom won't do that.
6250015	eng	Tom came here all the way from Boston.
6250016	eng	I don't think I'll ever get married.
6250017	eng	I think that Tom is doing that.
6250018	eng	Tom became a school teacher in Boston.
6250019	eng	I don't think I'd ever eat dog meat.
6250020	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be scared.
6250021	eng	Tom became a Canadian citizen in 2013.
6250022	eng	I don't think I want to do that now.
6250023	eng	I think Tom would've done that.
6250024	eng	Tom banged on the table with his fist.
6250025	eng	I don't think I should've done that.
6250026	eng	I think Tom would be terrified.
6250027	eng	Tom asked me who painted this picture.
6250028	eng	I don't think I can do that for you.
6250029	eng	I think Tom would be surprised.
6250030	eng	Tom asked me not to do that at school.
6250031	eng	I don't still need to do that, do I?
6250032	eng	I think Tom would be skeptical.
6250033	eng	Tom asked me if he could see me again.
6250034	eng	I don't still have to do that, do I?
6250035	eng	I think Tom would be objective.
6250036	eng	Tom asked me if I wanted to go abroad.
6250037	eng	I don't really think we can do that.
6250038	eng	I think Tom would be impressed.
6250039	eng	Tom asked me if I knew how to do that.
6250040	eng	I don't really feel like doing that.
6250041	eng	I think Tom won't be surprised.
6250042	eng	Tom asked if he really had to do that.
6250043	eng	I don't really care how you do that.
6250044	eng	I think Tom won't be back soon.
6250045	eng	Tom appeared on television last night.
6250046	eng	I don't often do this kind of thing.
6250047	eng	I think Tom will do that later.
6250048	eng	Tom apparently didn't want to do that.
6250049	eng	I don't need you to do that anymore.
6250050	eng	I think Tom will be suspicious.
6250051	eng	Tom apparently didn't need to do that.
6250052	eng	I don't need to make dinner tonight.
6250053	eng	Tom apparently didn't have to do that.
6250054	eng	I don't need to go to the dentist's.
6250055	eng	I think Tom will be here later.
6250056	eng	Tom apologized to me for his rudeness.
6250057	eng	I don't need to be there until 2:30.
6250058	eng	I think Tom will be frightened.
6250059	eng	Tom and his neighbors aren't safe yet.
6250060	eng	I don't live on Park Street anymore.
6250061	eng	I think Tom will be doing that.
6250062	eng	Tom and I've been married three years.
6250063	eng	I don't like walking alone at night.
6250064	eng	I think Tom will be displeased.
6250065	eng	Tom and I've been friends a long time.
6250066	eng	I don't like to throw anything away.
6250067	eng	I think Tom is going to resign.
6250068	eng	Tom and I've become very good friends.
6250069	eng	I don't like talking with strangers.
6250070	eng	I think Tom is being sarcastic.
6250071	eng	Tom and I've always gotten along well.
6250072	eng	I don't like talking about politics.
6250073	eng	I think Tom has gone to Boston.
6250074	eng	Tom and I've always been good friends.
6250075	eng	I don't like swimming in the winter.
6250076	eng	I think Tom did that on Monday.
6250077	eng	Tom and I'll be doing that on our own.
6250078	eng	I don't like reading romance novels.
6250079	eng	I think Tom could've done that.
6250080	eng	Tom and I work in the same restaurant.
6250081	eng	I don't like my neighbors very much.
6250082	eng	I think Tom could be impartial.
6250083	eng	Tom and I weren't supposed to do that.
6250084	eng	I don't like listening to the radio.
6250085	eng	I think Tom already knows that.
6250086	eng	Tom and I were together all afternoon.
6250087	eng	I don't like going to the dentist's.
6250088	eng	I think I can help Tom do that.
6250089	eng	Tom and I were sitting at the counter.
6250090	eng	I don't like baseball or basketball.
6250091	eng	I talked Tom out of doing that.
6250092	eng	Tom and I went to med school together.
6250093	eng	I don't know who's going to help us.
6250094	eng	I shouldn't have let Tom drive.
6250095	eng	Tom and I went on a date last weekend.
6250096	eng	I don't know who's going to help me.
6250097	eng	I shouldn't ask Tom to do that.
6250098	eng	Tom and I watched the sunset together.
6250099	eng	I don't know who's going to do that.
6250100	eng	I should've done that with Tom.
6250101	eng	Tom and I used to live on Park Street.
6250102	eng	I don't know what's really going on.
6250103	eng	I should've asked Tom for help.
6250104	eng	Tom and I used to go fishing together.
6250105	eng	I don't know if I'll do that or not.
6250106	eng	I should tell Tom I'll do that.
6250107	eng	Tom and I text each other quite often.
6250108	eng	I don't know how to tie a square knot.
6250109	eng	I should do what Tom suggested.
6250110	eng	Tom and I switched places on the sofa.
6250111	eng	I don't know how to tie a clove hitch.
6250112	eng	I should be in Boston with Tom.
6250113	eng	Tom and I swam to the island together.
6250114	eng	I don't know how to play the violin.
6250115	eng	You seem to know a lot about Tom's family.
6250116	eng	Tom and I still aren't ready to leave.
6250117	eng	I don't know how to play backgammon.
6250118	eng	I saw Tom sitting on the porch.
6250119	eng	Tom and I shook hands with each other.
6250120	eng	I don't know how long I should wait.
6250121	eng	I saw Tom doing that yesterday.
6250122	eng	Tom and I rarely do anything together.

6250318	eng	I didn't know what else I had to do.
6250319	eng	I doubt if Tom will be puzzled.

6250336	eng	I didn't have to do that, but I did.
6250337	eng	I doubt if Tom will be curious.
6250338	eng	Tom will probably make some mistakes.
6250339	eng	I didn't have to do that right away.
6250340	eng	I don't want to speak with Tom.
6250341	eng	Tom will probably forget his promise.
6250342	eng	I didn't have to cancel my vacation.
6250343	eng	I don't want to make Tom angry.

6250357	eng	I didn't fill in the form correctly.
6250358	eng	I don't want Tom to see me cry.
6250359	eng	Tom will likely agree not to do that.
6250360	eng	I didn't feel like doing that today.
6250361	eng	I don't think that Tom is busy.
6250362	eng	Tom will have a good time doing that.
6250363	eng	I didn't expect to get here on time.
6250364	eng	I don't think Tom will say yes.
6250365	eng	Tom will give us whatever we ask for.
6250366	eng	I didn't do that because I was sick.
6250367	eng	I don't think Tom will be late.

6250375	eng	I didn't actually do that by myself.
6250376	eng	I don't think Tom will be cold.
6250377	eng	Tom will be interested in doing that.
6250378	eng	I demand that you do that right now.
6250379	eng	I don't think Tom is unmarried.
6250380	eng	Tom will be able to do that, I think.
6250381	eng	I couldn't wish for anything better.
6250382	eng	I don't think Tom is satisfied.
6250383	eng	Tom will be able to do that tomorrow.
6250384	eng	I couldn't visit Boston last summer.
6250385	eng	I don't think Tom is miserable.

6250393	eng	I could go home if you wanted me to.
6250394	eng	I don't think Tom is dishonest.
6250395	eng	Tom wasn't sure he needed to do that.
6250396	eng	I could do that if you wanted me to.
6250397	eng	I don't think Tom is desperate.

6250401	eng	Tom wasn't able to do that yesterday.

6250403	eng	I don't think Tom is concerned.
6250404	eng	Tom wasn't able to do that very well.
6250405	eng	I can go with you if you want me to.
6250406	eng	I don't think Tom is conceited.
6250407	eng	Tom was worried you wouldn't do that.
6250408	eng	I bought myself a hat in that store.
6250409	eng	I don't talk to Tom very often.

6250450	eng	French is a very beautiful language.
6250451	eng	I don't do that as much as Tom.

6250453	eng	Fortunately, I've already done that.
6250454	eng	I don't do that as fast as Tom.
6250455	eng	Tom warned me not to do that anymore.
6250456	eng	Everything's back to the way it was.
6250457	eng	I don't care how Tom does that.
6250458	eng	Tom wanted to know why that happened.
6250459	eng	Everyone in my family likes singing.
6250460	eng	I didn't want to talk with Tom.

6250462	eng	Don't forget to turn off the lights.
6250463	eng	I didn't want to live with Tom.

6250475	eng	I didn't wait for Tom to speak.
6250476	eng	Tom used to be on the wrestling team.
6250477	eng	Doing that will likely be very easy.

6250479	eng	Tom tried to talk me into doing that.
6250480	eng	Doing that likely won't be much fun.
6250481	eng	I didn't think Tom wasn't safe.
6250482	eng	Tom tried to see if he could do that.
6250483	eng	Do your children like to drink milk?

6250486	eng	Do your children go to kindergarten?
6250487	eng	I didn't think Tom was nervous.
6250488	eng	Tom tried to do that three years ago.
6250489	eng	Do you want to go to Boston with us?
6250490	eng	I didn't think Tom was jealous.
6250491	eng	Tom tried doing that a few weeks ago.
6250492	eng	Do you think it'll be cold tomorrow?
6250493	eng	I didn't think Tom was at home.
6250494	eng	Tom told us he could teach us French.
6250495	eng	Do you think doing that would be OK?
6250496	eng	I didn't tell Tom I was sleepy.
6250497	eng	Tom told us about what happened next.
6250498	eng	Do you think I'd be able to do that?
6250499	eng	I didn't tell Tom I was hungry.
6250500	eng	Tom told me you were able to do that.
6250501	eng	Do you still go to Boston sometimes?
6250502	eng	I didn't talk about Tom at all.
6250503	eng	Tom told me that he's doing that now.
6250504	eng	Do you still go skiing every winter?
6250505	eng	I didn't recognize Tom's voice.
6250506	eng	Tom told me that he'd be cooperative.
6250507	eng	Do you really want to do that today?
6250508	eng	I didn't realize Tom was tired.
6250509	eng	Tom told me that I looked distracted.
6250510	eng	Do you really want to do that again?
6250511	eng	I didn't open the door for Tom.
6250512	eng	Tom told me his job was a lot of fun.
6250513	eng	Do you often think about the future?
6250514	eng	I didn't like Tom's suggestion.
6250515	eng	Tom told me he won't do that anymore.
6250516	eng	Do both of you still work in Boston?
6250517	eng	I didn't know why Tom was late.
6250518	eng	Tom told me I'm being too optimistic.
6250519	eng	Do both of you still live in Boston?
6250520	eng	I didn't know where Tom worked.
6250521	eng	Tom told me I should quit doing that.
6250522	eng	Do I have to do that again tomorrow?
6250523	eng	I didn't know how to thank Tom.
6250524	eng	Tom told me I didn't have to do that.
6250525	eng	Didn't you know anything about this?
6250526	eng	I didn't know how to reach Tom.
6250527	eng	Tom tiptoed so no one would hear him.
6250528	eng	Did you know that I used to do that?
6250529	eng	I didn't know how sick Tom was.
6250530	eng	Tom thought he could help us do that.
6250531	eng	Did you have good time at the party?
6250532	eng	I didn't know how rich Tom was.
6250533	eng	Tom thinks he's a pretty good singer.
6250534	eng	Did you have a good time doing that?
6250535	eng	I didn't know Tom was your son.
6250536	eng	Tom thinks he could probably do that.
6250537	eng	Cookie is a good name for a hamster.
6250538	eng	I didn't go to Boston with Tom.
6250539	eng	Tom takes good care of his customers.
6250540	eng	Can you tell me what you want to do?
6250541	eng	I didn't buy Tom's explanation.
6250542	eng	Tom swore he'd never do that anymore.
6250543	eng	Can you tell me what you need to do?
6250544	eng	I didn't believe what Tom said.
6250545	eng	Tom survived his wife by three years.
6250546	eng	Can you tell me what you have to do?
6250547	eng	I did what I could to help Tom.
6250548	eng	Tom suggested that you don't do that.
6250549	eng	Can you tell me what has to be done?
6250550	eng	I did that just to impress Tom.
6250551	eng	Tom succeeded because he worked hard.
6250552	eng	Boston is the city where I was born.
6250553	eng	I couldn't tell Tom everything.
6250554	eng	Tom substituted margarine for butter.
6250555	eng	Boston is the city that I like best.
6250556	eng	I certainly hope Tom does that.
6250557	eng	Tom studied hard so he wouldn't fail.
6250558	eng	Aren't you going to do that with me?
6250559	eng	I can't believe Tom is serious.
6250560	eng	Tom studied hard and passed the test.
6250561	eng	Are you still trying to lose weight?
6250562	eng	I can't be much older than Tom.
6250563	eng	Tom stuck the broken pieces together.
6250564	eng	Are you still determined to do that?
6250565	eng	I borrowed some money from Tom.
6250566	eng	Tom still likes to do that sometimes.
6250567	eng	Are you still be willing to do that?
6250568	eng	I ate about as much as Tom did.
6250569	eng	Tom still isn't very good at driving.
6250570	eng	Are you still be obliged to do that?
6250571	eng	I assumed Tom wouldn't do that.
6250572	eng	Tom still isn't very good at cooking.
6250573	eng	Are you still a part-time carpenter?
6250574	eng	I asked Tom to help me do that.
6250575	eng	Tom still isn't completely convinced.
6250576	eng	Are you interested in going with us?
6250577	eng	I already know where Tom works.
6250578	eng	Tom still hasn't dug up the potatoes.
6250579	eng	Are we supposed to be here tomorrow?
6250580	eng	I already know where Tom lives.
6250581	eng	Tom still has to do that, doesn't he?
6250582	eng	Am I the only one who can't do that?
6250583	eng	How often is Tom late for work?
6250584	eng	Tom still has many friends in Boston.
6250585	eng	"May I do that?" "No, please don't."
6250586	eng	How often does Tom play tennis?
6250587	eng	Tom still has a house on Park Street.
6250588	eng	Your shoes don't fit you very well.
6250589	eng	How often does Tom go downtown?
6250590	eng	Tom stayed longer than was necessary.
6250591	eng	Your plan seems to be the best one.
6250592	eng	How often does Tom cook dinner?
6250593	eng	Tom stayed in Boston for the weekend.
6250594	eng	Your girlfriend is older than mine.
6250595	eng	How many times did Tom do that?
6250596	eng	Tom stayed at a hotel near the beach.
6250597	eng	Your French is getting much better.
6250598	eng	How did Tom propose we do that?
6250599	eng	Tom started crying when he was fired.
6250600	eng	Your French has gotten much better.
6250601	eng	How did Tom propose to do that?
6250602	eng	Tom started crying when he fell down.
6250603	eng	You've studied French, haven't you?
6250604	eng	How did Tom propose doing that?
6250605	eng	Tom spent three days in the hospital.
6250606	eng	You've already had enough to drink.
6250607	eng	Even Tom spoke to me in French.
6250608	eng	Tom spent the whole weekend studying.
6250609	eng	You're too young to go there alone.
6250610	eng	Even Tom can understand French.
6250611	eng	Tom spent the evening reading a book.
6250612	eng	You're too young to buy cigarettes.
6250613	eng	Does Tom want to do that today?
6250614	eng	Tom spent most of his life in Boston.
6250615	eng	You're the stingiest person I know.
6250616	eng	Does Tom still want to do that?
6250617	eng	Tom spent a lot of time at the beach.
6250618	eng	You're the only one here I've told.
6250619	eng	Does Tom still need to do that?
6250620	eng	Tom spends a lot of time watching TV.
6250622	eng	Does Tom still have to do that?
6250623	eng	Tom slipped in through the back door.
6250624	eng	You're lucky you didn't get killed.
6250625	eng	Do you think Tom was satisfied?
6250626	eng	Tom slept through the entire concert.
6250627	eng	You're a stranger here, aren't you?
6250628	eng	Do you think Tom might be sick?
6250629	eng	Tom shouldn't have needed to do that.
6250630	eng	You're a soccer player, aren't you?
6250631	eng	Do you think Tom might be late?
6250632	eng	Tom should've gone to Boston with us.
6250633	vie	Cái xe này màu đen.
6250634	eng	You're a salesman, too, aren't you?
6250635	eng	Do you think Tom might be cold?
6250636	eng	Tom should've come to Boston with us.
6250637	eng	You're a relative of mine, I think.
6250638	eng	Do you think Tom might be busy?
6250639	eng	Tom should've closed all his windows.
6250640	eng	You're a music teacher, aren't you?
6250641	eng	Do you think Tom is dependable?
6250642	eng	Tom should've chosen a different job.
6250643	eng	You're a jazz musician, aren't you?
6250644	eng	Do you know why Tom was crying?
6250645	eng	Tom should've been with us yesterday.
6250646	eng	You're a heavy drinker, aren't you?
6250647	eng	Do you know why Tom is unhappy?
6250648	eng	Tom should've been irritated by that.
6250649	eng	You're a bit conceited, aren't you?
6250650	eng	Do you always help Tom do that?
6250651	eng	Tom should do that as soon as he can.
6250652	eng	You're a Boston native, aren't you?
6250653	eng	Didn't you know Tom was lonely?
6250654	eng	Tom should be done doing that by now.
6250655	eng	You'll have a good time doing that.
6250656	eng	Didn't you know Tom was hungry?
6250657	eng	Tom should be able to do that easily.
6250658	eng	You'll do that tomorrow, won't you?
6250659	eng	Didn't you know Tom was asleep?
6250660	eng	Tom shot at the tiger, but missed it.
6250661	eng	You'll do that sometime, won't you?
6250662	eng	Did you talk to Tom last night?
6250663	eng	Tom shielded his eyes from the light.
6250664	eng	You'll be here tomorrow, won't you?
6250665	eng	Did you really say that to Tom?
6250666	eng	Tom seems to have found a girlfriend.
6250667	eng	You'll be doing that with us later.
6250668	eng	Did you know that Tom did that?
6250669	eng	Tom seems to be unwilling to do that.
6250670	eng	You'll be able to do that, I think.
6250671	eng	Did you know Tom would do that?
6250672	eng	Tom seems to be reluctant to do that.
6250673	eng	You won't really do that, will you?
6250675	eng	Tom seems to be doing that very well.
6250676	eng	You won't let us do that, will you?
6250677	eng	Can Tom be in Boston on Monday?
6250678	eng	Tom seems to be an easy-going person.
6250679	eng	You won't have a chance to do that.
6250680	eng	Ask Tom what he wants to watch.
6250681	eng	Tom seems really laid back and happy.
6250682	eng	You won't be able to do that alone.
6250683	eng	Ask Tom what he wants to drink.
6250684	eng	Tom seems aware of what was going on.
6250686	eng	Ask Tom if we can speak French.
6250687	eng	Tom seems a little busier than usual.
6250688	eng	You used to sell shoes, didn't you?
6250689	eng	Ask Tom if he wants to do that.
6250690	eng	Tom seemed to know what he should do.
6250691	eng	You think I can do that, don't you?
6250692	eng	Ask Tom if he needs to do that.
6250693	eng	Tom seemed to know what he had to do.
6250694	eng	You still do that a lot, don't you?
6250695	eng	Ask Tom if he can teach French.
6250696	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I did that.
6250697	eng	You should've let me do that first.
6250698	eng	Are you sure Tom will be there?
6250699	eng	Tom searched in his bag for a pencil.
6250700	eng	You should've done that last night.
6250701	eng	"Who's that man?" "That's Tom."
6250702	eng	Tom searched his pockets for the key.
6250703	eng	You should've been able to do that.
6250704	eng	You're a lot younger than Tom.
6250705	eng	Tom says there's plenty more to come.
6250706	eng	You should go to bed early tonight.
6250707	eng	You're a lot shorter than Tom.
6250708	eng	Tom says there isn't time to do that.
6250709	eng	You should at least try doing that.
6250710	eng	You're a bit shorter than Tom.
6250711	eng	Tom says the tap water made him sick.
6250712	eng	You seemed to be afraid to do that.
6250713	eng	You're a bad influence on Tom.
6250714	eng	Tom says the heat doesn't bother him.
6250715	eng	You seem to be a very good swimmer.
6250716	eng	You should get Tom to do that.
6250717	eng	Tom says that's a legitimate concern.
6250718	eng	You seem to be a reasonable person.
6250719	eng	You look a lot older than Tom.
6250720	eng	Tom says that he'll do that tomorrow.
6250721	eng	You seem more determined than ever.
6250722	eng	You hit Tom first, didn't you?
6250723	eng	Tom says that he won't do that again.
6250724	eng	You refused to do that, didn't you?
6250725	eng	You agreed to let Tom do that.
6250726	eng	Tom says mosquitoes don't bother him.
6250727	eng	You probably won't need to do that.
6250728	eng	Will you let Tom go to Boston?
6250729	eng	Tom says life is what you make of it.
6250730	eng	You probably won't have to do that.
6250731	eng	Will Tom go to Boston with us?
6250732	eng	Tom says he's considering doing that.
6250733	eng	You never should've gone to Boston.
6250734	eng	Why would Tom have to do that?
6250735	eng	Tom says he's been fired three times.
6250736	eng	You need to show me how to do that.
6250737	eng	Why were you and Tom fighting?
6250738	eng	Tom says he'll still be here at 2:30.
6250739	eng	You need to pay your bills on time.
6250740	eng	Why should Tom stay in Boston?
6250741	eng	Tom says he wouldn't want to do that.
6250742	eng	You need to do that sometime today.
6250743	eng	Why should I be afraid of Tom?
6250744	eng	Tom says he won't do that by himself.
6250745	eng	You must write the essay in French.
6250746	eng	Why should I apologize to Tom?
6250747	eng	Tom says he won't ask you to do that.
6250748	eng	You might get fired if you do that.
6250749	eng	Why isn't Tom going to Boston?
6250750	eng	Tom says he thought he could do that.
6250751	eng	You may get injured if you do that.
6250752	eng	Who told you Tom spoke French?
6250753	eng	Tom says he thinks he has to do that.
6250754	eng	You may even have to do that again.
6250755	eng	Where does Tom stay in Boston?
6250756	eng	Tom says he likes this kind of music.
6250757	eng	You look the same as you always do.
6250758	eng	Where do you think Tom is now?
6250759	eng	Tom says he isn't worried about that.
6250760	eng	You look nothing like your brother.
6250761	eng	Where did you and Tom do that?
6250762	eng	Tom says he hasn't slept in 24 hours.
6250763	eng	You look more determined than ever.
6250764	eng	When did you do that with Tom?
6250765	eng	Tom says he has always loved history.
6250766	eng	You look funny wearing those shoes.
6250767	eng	What Tom said isn't 100% true.
6250768	eng	Tom says he doesn't like his new job.
6250769	eng	You look as if you've seen a ghost.
6250770	eng	What Tom is doing is annoying.
6250771	eng	Tom says he doesn't enjoy doing that.
6250772	eng	You live here in Boston, don't you?
6250773	eng	We're waiting for Tom to come.
6250774	eng	Tom says he definitely won't do that.
6250776	eng	We weren't in Boston with Tom.
6250777	eng	Tom says everything's back to normal.
6250778	eng	You have to show me how to do that.
6250779	eng	We hid from Tom in the garage.
6250780	eng	Tom says all that doesn't bother him.
6250781	eng	You have to do that sometime today.
6250782	eng	We don't have to wait for Tom.
6250783	eng	Tom says Boston is his favorite city.
6250784	eng	You have a lot of books, don't you?
6250785	eng	Warn Tom not to do that today.
6250786	eng	Tom saw what happened from his porch.
6250787	eng	You forgot to remind me to do that.
6250788	eng	Warn Tom not to do that again.
6250789	eng	Tom said you need to be more careful.
6250790	eng	You don't seem to enjoy doing that.
6250791	eng	Those aren't Tom's sunglasses.
6250792	eng	Tom said you just have to be patient.
6250793	eng	You don't really live here, do you?
6250794	eng	This picture was drawn by Tom.
6250795	eng	Tom said you have to be more careful.
6250796	eng	You don't look like you're worried.
6250797	eng	They pay Tom a lot to do that.
6250798	eng	Tom said those accusations are false.
6250799	eng	You don't look like you're pleased.
6250800	eng	These aren't Tom's sunglasses.
6250801	eng	Tom said the smell didn't bother him.
6250802	eng	You don't look like you're nervous.
6250803	eng	The way Tom did that was nice.
6250804	eng	Tom said the plan wasn't good enough.
6250805	eng	You don't have to do that tomorrow.
6250806	eng	The way Tom did that was good.
6250807	eng	Tom said the picnic was a lot of fun.
6250808	eng	You do that a lot better than I do.
6250809	eng	The only nice guy here is Tom.
6250810	eng	Tom said the noise didn't bother him.
6250811	eng	You didn't seem to want to do that.
6250812	eng	The only Canadian here is Tom.
6250813	eng	Tom said the economy is in bad shape.
6250814	eng	You didn't really do that, did you?
6250815	eng	Tell Tom to close the windows.
6250816	eng	Tom said that's what he wants to eat.
6250817	eng	You did that yesterday, didn't you?
6250818	eng	Tell Tom he shouldn't do that.
6250819	eng	Tom said that's what he wants to buy.
6250820	eng	You did that very fast, didn't you?
6250821	eng	Stay here until Tom gets back.
6250822	eng	Tom said that's not likely to happen.
6250823	eng	You did that in school, didn't you?
6250824	eng	Shouldn't we help Tom do that?
6250825	eng	Tom said that's far from good enough.
6250826	eng	You can't do that, either, can you?
6250827	eng	Should we tell Tom to do that?
6250828	eng	Tom said that would be too expensive.
6250829	eng	You can't do that without a permit.
6250830	eng	Please tell Tom to be quieter.
6250831	eng	Tom said that wasn't why he did that.
6250832	eng	You can help us do that, can't you?
6250833	eng	Please don't do that with Tom.
6250834	eng	Tom said that wasn't the real reason.
6250835	eng	You can do that now if you want to.
6250836	eng	Perhaps Tom will do that, too.
6250837	eng	Tom said that the smoke bothered him.
6250838	eng	You apparently should've done that.
6250839	eng	Perhaps Tom wanted to do that.
6250840	eng	Tom said that the smell bothered him.
6250841	eng	Would you want to be in Boston now?
6250842	eng	Perhaps Tom is doing that now.
6250843	eng	Tom said that the noise bothered him.
6250844	eng	Would you tell me how you did that?
6250845	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't drink tea.
6250846	eng	Tom said that it would probably snow.
6250847	eng	Would you mind lending me a pencil?
6250848	eng	Most likely Tom won't do that.
6250849	eng	Tom said that it would probably rain.
6250850	eng	Would you mind getting that for me?
6250851	eng	Maybe we can buy that for Tom.
6250852	eng	Tom said that he won't do that again.
6250853	eng	Would you like to go there with me?
6250854	eng	Maybe Tom should study French.
6250855	eng	Tom said that he wasn't feeling well.
6250856	eng	Would you explain how you did that?
6250857	eng	Maybe Tom has to do that, too.
6250858	eng	Tom said that he was prepared to die.
6250859	eng	Would you ever consider doing that?
6250860	eng	Let's get Tom to do that for you.
6250861	eng	Tom said that he intended to do that.
6250862	eng	Would you be able to do that today?
6250863	eng	Let Tom eat whatever he wants.
6250864	eng	Tom said that he did that by himself.
6250865	eng	Would it be OK if I did that today?
6250866	eng	Let Tom eat anything he wants.
6250867	eng	Tom said that could happen next week.
6250868	eng	Will you really be able to do that?
6250869	eng	Let Tom buy whatever he wants.
6250870	eng	Tom said some things wouldn't change.
6250871	eng	Will you do that here or in Boston?
6250872	eng	Let Tom buy anything he wants.
6250873	eng	Tom said it was very easy to do that.
6250874	eng	Will you be doing that by yourself?
6250875	eng	It's a pity that Tom did that.
6250876	eng	Tom said it was the other way around.
6250877	eng	Will you be able to do that for us?
6250878	eng	It was rude of Tom to do that.
6250879	eng	Tom said it was a good time to leave.
6250880	eng	Why don't you want to go to Boston?
6250881	eng	Is Tom really still a student?
6250882	eng	Tom said it didn't bother him at all.
6250883	eng	Why don't you to do that right now?
6250884	eng	If Tom does that, let me know.
6250885	eng	Tom said his team would probably win.
6250886	eng	Who'll be at the meeting next week?
6250887	eng	I've persuaded Tom to do that.
6250888	eng	Tom said his parents have been there.
6250889	eng	Who told you you needed to do that?
6250890	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be nervous.
6250891	eng	Tom said his new suit cost him a lot.
6250892	eng	Who does this motorcycle belong to?
6250893	eng	I'm sure Tom will be stubborn.
6250894	eng	Tom said his new boat cost him a lot.
6250895	eng	Who did you receive that book from?
6250896	eng	I'm sure Tom will be sensible.
6250897	eng	Tom said he's seen people doing that.
6250898	eng	Where will you be tomorrow evening?
6250899	eng	I'm sure Tom will be punished.
6250900	eng	Tom said he's noticed the difference.
6250901	eng	When will you return my book to me?
6250902	eng	I'm sure Tom will be punctual.
6250903	eng	Tom said he's immune to that disease.
6250904	eng	When do you plan to come to Boston?
6250905	eng	I'm sure Tom will be prepared.
6250906	eng	Tom said he's glad you could do that.
6250907	eng	Whatever you may say, I'll do that.
6250908	eng	I'm sure Tom will be confused.
6250909	eng	Tom said he's aware of the situation.
6250910	eng	What's your favorite kind of pizza?
6250911	eng	I'm sure Tom will be arrested.
6250912	eng	Tom said he's always lived in Boston.
6250913	eng	What time was it that you did that?
6250914	eng	I'm sure Tom needs to do that.
6250915	eng	Tom said he's always been an athlete.
6250916	eng	What do you usually do after lunch?
6250917	eng	I'm sorry that I made Tom cry.
6250918	eng	Tom said he'd think about doing that.
6250919	eng	What colors do you most often wear?
6250920	eng	I'm positive Tom will do that.
6250921	eng	Tom said he'd probably do that today.
6250922	eng	What are some of the main features?
6250923	eng	I'm convinced Tom can do that.
6250924	eng	Tom said he'd prefer to stay at home.
6250925	eng	Weren't you going to do that today?
6250926	eng	I'd never speak French to Tom.
6250927	eng	Tom said he'd like to live in Boston.
6250928	eng	Were you in Boston for a long time?
6250929	eng	I wonder what Tom needs to do.
6250930	eng	Tom said he'd help us any way he can.
6250931	eng	We've decided not to do that again.
6250932	eng	I wonder if Tom will be early.
6250933	eng	Tom said he'd be thrilled to do that.
6250934	eng	We're not living in Boston anymore.
6250935	eng	I wonder if Tom was surprised.
6250936	eng	Tom said he wouldn't want to do that.
6250937	eng	We won't be in Boston until Monday.
6250938	eng	I wonder if Tom is suspicious.
6250939	eng	Tom said he wouldn't like to do that.
6250940	eng	We stayed in Boston for three days.
6250941	eng	I wonder if Tom is prejudiced.
6250942	eng	Tom said he wouldn't do that anymore.
6250943	eng	We lived in Boston for a few years.
6250944	eng	I wonder if Tom is interested.
6250945	eng	Tom said he won't ever do that again.
6250946	eng	We hope you'll be back in Boston soon.
6250947	eng	I wonder if Tom is illiterate.
6250948	eng	Tom said he won't attend the meeting.
6250949	eng	We have to stay in Boston all week.
6250950	eng	I wonder if Tom is going deaf.
6250951	eng	Tom said he wished you would do that.
6250952	eng	We got married and moved to Boston.
6250953	eng	I wonder if Tom is frightened.
6250954	eng	Tom said he wished you could do that.
6250955	eng	We don't have to do that every day.
6250956	eng	I wonder if Tom is feeling OK.
6250957	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to be there.
6250958	eng	We don't come to Boston very often.
6250959	eng	I wonder if Tom is downstairs.
6250960	eng	Tom said he was trying to stay awake.
6250961	eng	We do that every day in the summer.
6250962	eng	I wonder if Tom is dependable.
6250963	eng	Tom said he was trying to be careful.
6250964	eng	We didn't know where we were going.
6250965	eng	I wonder if Tom is colorblind.
6250966	eng	Tom said he was too young to do that.
6250967	eng	We can't just ignore the situation.
6250968	eng	I wonder if Tom has done that.
6250969	eng	Tom said he was too tired to do that.
6250970	eng	Was it yesterday that you did that?
6250971	eng	I wonder if Tom has been hurt.
6250972	eng	Tom said he was too drunk to do that.
6250973	eng	Too bad we weren't able to do that.
6250974	eng	I won't speak French with Tom.
6250975	eng	Tom said he was the one who did that.
6250977	eng	I won't permit Tom to do that.
6250978	eng	Tom said he was delighted to do that.
6250979	eng	This isn't a good place to do that.
6250980	eng	I won't make Tom study French.
6250981	eng	Tom said he was asked not to do that.
6250982	eng	This dessert should be served cold.
6250983	eng	I won't go to Boston with Tom.
6250984	eng	Tom said he wants to be an architect.
6250985	eng	There's no more oxygen in the tank.
6250986	eng	I wish that Tom would do that.
6250987	eng	Tom said he wanted to be cooperative.
6250988	eng	There's enough time to do that now.
6250989	eng	I wish I hadn't yelled at Tom.
6250990	eng	Tom said he thought he could help us.
6250991	eng	There are plenty things left to do.
6250992	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom that.
6250993	eng	Tom said he thought he could do that.
6250994	eng	The past three days have been hard.
6250995	eng	I wasn't expecting Tom's help.
6250996	eng	Tom said he thinks his team will win.
6250997	eng	The past three days have been cold.
6250998	eng	I wasn't able to convince Tom.
6250999	eng	Tom said he sold his house last week.
6251000	eng	The last three days have been hard.
6251001	eng	I was going to call Tom later.
6251002	eng	Tom said he shouldn't have done that.
6251003	eng	The last three days have been cold.
6251004	eng	I want to be friends with Tom.
6251005	eng	Tom said he really didn't understand.
6251006	eng	The edge of that teacup is chipped.
6251007	eng	I want Tom to help me do that.
6251008	eng	Tom said he now regrets his decision.
6251009	eng	That's the reason I didn't do that.
6251010	eng	I told Tom to stop doing that.
6251011	eng	Tom said he never felt in any danger.
6251012	eng	That's not what people normally do.
6251013	eng	I told Tom to quit doing that.
6251014	eng	Tom said he needs to call the police.
6251015	eng	That's a really stupid thing to do.
6251016	eng	I told Tom I'd be coming back.
6251017	eng	Tom said he needed to get more sleep.
6251018	eng	That was the first time I did that.
6251019	eng	I told Tom I wouldn't do that.
6251020	eng	Tom said he knew this day would come.
6251021	eng	That simply doesn't any make sense.
6251022	eng	I thought Tom would be sleepy.
6251023	eng	Tom said he knew both of the victims.
6251024	eng	That seems like a real possibility.
6251025	eng	I thought Tom would be scared.
6251026	eng	Tom said he isn't worried about that.
6251027	eng	Thanks for reminding me to do that.
6251028	eng	I thought Tom would be lonely.
6251029	eng	Tom said he himself was an alcoholic.
6251030	eng	Please do that as soon as possible.
6251031	eng	I thought Tom would be grumpy.
6251032	eng	Tom said he has to borrow some money.
6251033	eng	Perhaps there's no need to do that.
6251034	eng	I thought Tom would be afraid.
6251035	eng	Tom said he had the right to do that.
6251036	eng	Only adults are allowed to do that.
6251037	eng	I thought Tom would be absent.
6251038	eng	Tom said he had the day off tomorrow.
6251039	eng	No two people do that the same way.
6251040	eng	I thought Tom was your cousin.
6251041	eng	Tom said he figured he could do that.
6251042	eng	My wife and I both want to do that.
6251043	eng	I thought Tom was unimpressed.
6251044	eng	Tom said he doesn't feel like a hero.
6251045	eng	My passport will expire in October.
6251046	eng	I thought Tom was embarrassed.
6251047	eng	Tom said he doesn't enjoy doing that.
6251048	eng	My parents have just thrown me out.
6251049	eng	I thought Tom was discouraged.
6251050	eng	Tom said he doesn't eat pork anymore.
6251051	eng	My name was at the top of the list.
6251052	eng	I thought Tom was cooperative.
6251053	eng	Tom said he doesn't eat meat anymore.
6251054	eng	My last day of work will be Monday.
6251055	eng	I thought Tom was a carpenter.
6251056	eng	Tom said he didn't know who did that.
6251057	eng	My house was bombed during the war.
6251058	eng	I thought Tom seemed confused.
6251059	eng	Tom said he didn't have a girlfriend.
6251060	eng	My house isn't very well insulated.
6251061	eng	I thought Tom didn't like you.
6251062	eng	Tom said he didn't feel like dancing.
6251063	eng	My house is just around the corner.
6251064	eng	I think Tom would be truthful.
6251065	eng	Tom said he didn't do that yesterday.
6251066	eng	My boss is a thirty-year-old woman.
6251067	eng	I think Tom would be prepared.
6251068	eng	Tom said he almost forgot to do that.
6251069	eng	My apartment is on the third floor.
6251070	eng	I think Tom won't be punctual.
6251071	eng	Tom said donors may remain anonymous.
6251072	eng	Monday will probably be a cold day.
6251073	eng	I think Tom will visit Boston.
6251074	eng	Tom said doing that was a lot of fun.
6251075	eng	Monday will probably be a busy day.
6251076	eng	I think Tom will go to Boston.
6251077	eng	Tom said I looked a little skeptical.
6251078	eng	Men and women do that the same way.
6251079	eng	I think Tom will be suspended.
6251080	eng	Tom said I have to do that by Monday.
6251081	eng	Luckily, we have an emergency fund.
6251082	eng	I think Tom will be surprised.
6251083	eng	Tom retired from the company in 2013.
6251084	eng	Let's wait until Monday to do that.
6251085	eng	I think Tom will be impressed.
6251086	eng	Tom regrets that he couldn't do that.
6251087	eng	Let's go to a movie tomorrow night.
6251088	eng	I think Tom will be back soon.
6251089	eng	Tom refused to give me what I wanted.
6251090	eng	Let's eat lunch earlier than usual.
6251091	eng	I think Tom wanted to do that.
6251092	eng	Tom really played exceptionally well.
6251093	eng	Let's do that together after lunch.
6251094	eng	I think Tom needed to do that.
6251095	eng	Tom really is good a sport, isn't he?
6251096	eng	It's very noisy here in the summer.
6251097	eng	I think Tom is waiting for me.
6251098	eng	Tom really has to do that right away.
6251099	eng	It's quite possible that'll happen.
6251100	eng	I think Tom is self-conscious.
6251101	eng	Tom realizes that there's still hope.
6251102	eng	It's nice to be alone for a change.
6251103	eng	I think Tom is retired by now.
6251104	eng	Tom raised three children by himself.
6251105	eng	It's OK if you do that before I do.
6251106	eng	I think Tom is about to leave.
6251107	eng	Tom quite often does that by himself.
6251108	eng	It'll take me a long time to do that.
6251109	eng	I think Tom didn't believe me.
6251110	eng	Tom promised me he'd teach me French.
6251111	eng	It'll probably be tough to do that.
6251112	eng	I think Tom can do that today.
6251113	eng	Tom probably won't make any mistakes.
6251114	eng	It'll probably be cheap to do that.
6251115	eng	I think I'll buy that for Tom.
6251116	eng	Tom probably won't come to the party.
6251117	eng	It wouldn't be safe to do that now.
6251118	eng	I sure hope Tom visits Boston.
6251119	eng	Tom probably won't be back by Monday.
6251120	eng	It wouldn't be much fun to do that.
6251121	eng	I still haven't talked to Tom.
6251122	eng	Tom probably shouldn't do that today.
6251123	eng	It wouldn't be easy to do that now.
6251124	eng	I still have feelings for Tom.
6251125	eng	Tom probably isn't going to be there.
6251126	eng	It would've been unsafe to do that.
6251128	eng	Tom probably doesn't want to do that.
6251129	eng	It would've been tiring to do that.
6251130	eng	I should've been nicer to Tom.
6251131	eng	Tom probably doesn't need to do that.
6251132	eng	It would've been stupid to do that.
6251133	eng	I should've apologized to Tom.
6251134	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where I am.
6251135	eng	It would be wrong to do that again.
6251136	eng	I should tell Tom what to buy.
6251137	eng	Tom probably doesn't have to do that.
6251138	eng	It would be stupid to do that here.
6251139	eng	I pretended I didn't know Tom.
6251140	eng	Tom probably doesn't do that anymore.
6251141	eng	It would be smart to do that again.
6251142	eng	I need to tell Tom what to do.
6251143	eng	Tom pricked his finger with a needle.
6251144	eng	It would be silly to do that again.
6251145	eng	I need to tell Tom to do that.
6251146	eng	Tom pretty much always stays at home.
6251147	eng	It would be great to see you again.
6251148	eng	I know why Tom went to Boston.
6251149	eng	Tom plans to go to college next fall.
6251150	eng	It would be foolish to do that now.
6251151	eng	I know why Tom studied French.
6251152	eng	Tom plans to be back on October 20th.
6251153	eng	It would be easy for us to do that.
6251154	eng	I know why Tom should do that.
6251155	eng	Tom picked a pencil up off the floor.
6251156	eng	It would be better if you did that.
6251157	eng	I know why Tom has to do that.
6251158	eng	Tom permitted me to use his computer.
6251159	eng	It would be a good idea to do that.
6251160	eng	I know why Tom had to do that.
6251161	eng	Tom passed away unexpectedly in 2013.
6251162	eng	It won't be easy to find a job now.
6251163	eng	I know why Tom got suspicious.
6251164	eng	Tom opened his eyes and smiled at me.
6251165	eng	It was raining yesterday afternoon.
6251166	eng	I know why Tom didn't do that.
6251167	eng	Tom opened his eyes and looked at me.
6251168	eng	It sounds like you want to do that.
6251169	eng	I know why Tom came to Boston.
6251170	eng	Tom only does that because he has to.
6251171	eng	It doesn't matter what you may say.
6251172	eng	I know what time Tom got home.
6251173	eng	Tom often does that in the afternoon.
6251174	eng	It doesn't look like you're sleepy.
6251175	eng	I know the way to Tom's house.
6251176	eng	Tom often does that in his free time.
6251177	eng	It doesn't look like you're lonely.
6251178	eng	I know that Tom won't do that.
6251179	eng	Tom often complains about mosquitoes.
6251180	eng	Isn't there a safer way to do that?
6251181	eng	I know that Tom was surprised.
6251182	eng	Tom obviously doesn't need the money.
6251183	eng	Is the elevator still out of order?
6251184	eng	I know that Tom is unfriendly.
6251185	eng	Tom noticed that the doors were open.
6251186	eng	Is it true that you didn't do that?
6251187	eng	I know that Tom is suspicious.
6251188	eng	Tom never had chicken pox as a child.
6251189	eng	If you're thirsty, drink something.
6251190	eng	I know that Tom is successful.
6251191	eng	Tom never complained about the smell.
6251192	eng	I've taught French for three years.
6251193	eng	I know that Tom is ridiculous.
6251194	eng	Tom never commented on the situation.
6251195	eng	I've never seen you do that before.
6251196	eng	I know that Tom is prejudiced.
6251197	eng	Tom needs to do something about that.
6251198	eng	I've had no chance to visit Boston.
6251199	eng	I know that Tom is photogenic.
6251200	eng	Tom needs to be aware of the dangers.
6251201	eng	I've been working for minimum wage.
6251202	eng	I know that Tom is persuasive.

6251206	eng	Tom needed to find someplace to live.
6251207	eng	I've been coughing since yesterday.

6251210	eng	I've already done what I had to do.
6251211	eng	I know that Tom is interested.
6251212	eng	Tom might even have to do that again.
6251213	eng	I'm too young to apply for the job.
6251214	eng	I know that Tom is infuriated.
6251215	eng	Tom might be excused from doing that.
6251216	eng	I'm three thousand dollars in debt.
6251217	eng	I know that Tom is illiterate.

6251258	eng	I'm hoping to sell my car for $300.
6251259	eng	I hope that Tom won't do that.
6251260	eng	Tom knows that I don't often do that.

6251285	eng	I'd rather do that some other time.
6251286	eng	I helped Tom unload the truck.
6251287	eng	Tom isn't willing to do that anymore.
6251288	eng	I'd rather be doing something else.
6251289	eng	I helped Tom start over again.

6251312	eng	I'd be afraid to do that by myself.
6251313	eng	I doubt if Tom will be sleepy.

6251601	eng	Did Tom say he'd visit Boston?
6251602	eng	Tom is a very family-oriented person.
6251603	eng	I hope to visit Boston next summer.
6251604	eng	Did Tom say he'd go to Boston?

6251615	eng	I haven't yet attempted to do that.
6251616	eng	When Tom asked Mary what she was planning to do on Monday evening, she said she'd be cleaning her room.
6251617	eng	Tom invited us to his birthday party.
6251618	eng	I haven't done that very many times yet.
6251619	eng	Tom wondered how many times he'd have to tell Mary to clean her room before she finally did.
6251620	eng	Tom insisted that we do that for him.
6251621	eng	I have to do that before I go home.
6251622	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to go swimming unless John goes swimming with her.
6251623	eng	Tom initially said he wasn't nervous.
6251624	eng	I have no intentions of doing that.
6251625	eng	Tom wanted to show Mary how to do that, so next time she could do it and he wouldn't have to.
6251626	eng	Tom hurt his elbow when he fell down.
6251627	eng	I have a degree in music education.
6251628	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that she needs to be more careful the next time she does that.
6251629	eng	Tom hurt himself while playing rugby.

6251636	eng	I found out who broke your windows.
6251637	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be at school last Monday, so he was surprised when he saw her.
6251638	eng	Tom holds an MBA degree from Harvard.
6251639	eng	I expect you to do that right away.
6251640	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be permitted to do that while his parents were away.
6251641	eng	Tom held out his hand and I shook it.
6251642	eng	I don't yet know what I need to do.
6251643	eng	Tom got out of his car, walked around to the passenger side and opened the door for Mary.
6251644	eng	Tom hasn't told us what he has to do.
6251645	eng	I don't yet know what I have to do.
6251646	fra	Nous aimons toujours ceux qui nous admirent et nous n'aimons pas toujours ceux que nous admirons.
6251647	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to tell John what time the meeting was going to start.
6251648	eng	Tom hasn't lived in Boston very long.
6251649	eng	I don't wear pajamas in the summer.
6251650	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she wouldn't be allowed to do that.

6251652	eng	I don't watch TV very much anymore.
6251653	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that she has to be more careful the next time she does that.
6251654	eng	Tom hasn't done that since last year.
6251655	eng	I don't want you to do that for me.
6251656	eng	Tom and Mary were speaking to each other in French, thinking I couldn't understand them.
6251657	eng	Tom hasn't done that in three months.
6251658	eng	I don't want to waste time arguing.
6251659	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to waste her time trying to convince John to do that.
6251660	eng	Tom hasn't done that for a long time.
6251661	eng	I don't want to talk to you either.
6251662	eng	You should probably tell Tom not to waste his time trying to convince Mary to do that.
6251663	eng	Tom hasn't complained about that yet.
6251664	eng	I don't want to play outside today.
6251665	eng	When Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go out on Monday evening, she said she'd be busy.
6251666	eng	Tom hasn't commented on the incident.
6251667	eng	I don't want to leave empty-handed.
6251668	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that while his parents are away.
6251669	eng	Tom hasn't been home in three months.
6251670	eng	I don't want to go there by myself.

6251676	eng	I don't want to get into the water.
6251677	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't want to go sailing unless he goes sailing with her.
6251678	eng	Tom hasn't been accused of any crime.
6251679	eng	I don't want to do that right away.
6251680	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that the day before yesterday, but he didn't have time.
6251681	eng	Tom hasn't accomplished anything yet.
6251682	eng	I don't want to do that after dark.
6251683	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where John and Mary are planning to go for their honeymoon.

6251690	eng	Tom has visited Boston several times.
6251691	eng	I don't think this makes any sense.
6251692	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she needs to be more careful the next time she does that.
6251693	eng	Tom has until October 20th to decide.
6251694	eng	I don't think that'll happen today.
6251695	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she won't be allowed to do that.
6251696	eng	Tom has twice as many stamps as I do.
6251697	eng	I don't think that really happened.
6251698	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be interested in going to the zoo with you and the children.
6251699	eng	Tom has told me not to do that again.
6251700	eng	I don't think enough is being done.
6251701	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary thought it would be a good idea to help John do that.
6251702	eng	Tom has to figure out how to do that.

6251768	eng	Tom has had surgery on his right leg.
6251769	eng	I don't know why I have to do that.
6251770	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be amused by the story John was going to tell her.
6251771	eng	Tom has grown a lot in the last year.
6251772	eng	I don't know who started the rumor.
6251773	eng	Tom did what Mary asked him to do, but he didn't do what John asked him to do.
6251774	eng	Tom has gone back to Boston for good.
6251775	eng	I don't know where my car keys are.

6251777	eng	Tom has enough time to do that today.
6251778	eng	I don't know what I need to do yet.
6251779	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't be able to do that as quickly as Mary, didn't you?

6251781	eng	I don't know what I have to do yet.

6251923	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still the one responsible for getting that done.
6251924	eng	Tom had planned to do that yesterday.
6251925	eng	I didn't realize what was going on.
6251926	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that anymore.
6251927	eng	Tom had his appendix removed in 2013.
6251928	eng	I didn't play in the first quarter.
6251929	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary well enough to know that she won't do that.
6251930	eng	Tom had all day to finish doing that.
6251931	eng	I didn't plan on talking to anyone.
6251932	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do everything John is asking her to do.
6251933	eng	Tom had a very tough time doing that.
6251934	eng	I didn't need to get here so early.
6251935	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do everything John has asked her to do.
6251936	eng	Tom had a piece of paper in his hand.
6251937	eng	I didn't need to do that yesterday.
6251938	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John thinks she should do.
6251939	eng	Tom had a lot to do with the project.
6251940	eng	I didn't like that movie very much.
6251941	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to not say anything about what happened.
6251942	eng	Tom had a lot of things he had to do.
6251943	eng	I didn't know why that was happening.
6251944	eng	Tom and his three sons went on a picnic with Mary and her three daughters.
6251945	eng	Tom had a hard time making ends meet.
6251946	eng	I didn't know which button to push.
6251947	eng	Tom advised Mary not to waste her time trying to persuade John to do that.
6251948	eng	Tom grew up in a very wealthy family.
6251949	eng	I didn't know where to park my car.
6251950	eng	Tom advised Mary not to waste her time trying to convince John to do that.
6251951	eng	Tom grew a beard to look more mature.
6251952	eng	I didn't know what the problem was.
6251953	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary about what happened.
6251954	eng	Tom greeted his visitors at the door.
6251955	eng	I didn't know what else I could do.
6251956	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary were dating each other until John told me.
6251957	eng	Tom grasped the rope with both hands.
6251958	eng	I didn't know how I should do that.
6251959	eng	Tom would've done that by himself if Mary hadn't volunteered to help him.
6251960	eng	Tom graduated from college last year.
6251961	eng	I didn't know Mary was your sister.
6251962	eng	Tom told Mary that she had to be more careful the next time she did that.
6251963	eng	Tom got very angry with his children.
6251964	eng	I didn't know I was being followed.
6251965	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she needs to be careful not to make John angry.
6251966	eng	Tom gave me exactly what I asked for.
6251967	eng	I didn't hear my name being called.
6251968	eng	Tom seemed to know that Mary didn't do what she said she was going to do.
6251969	eng	Tom found it hard to stay optimistic.
6251970	eng	I didn't have to do that yesterday.
6251971	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would need at least $300 to buy what she needed.
6251972	eng	Tom flirts with every woman he meets.
6251973	eng	I didn't have to do that by myself.
6251974	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be allowed to do that when she gets older.
6251975	eng	Tom finished doing that very quickly.
6251976	eng	I didn't have the nerve to do that.
6251977	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might be allowed to do that if she did it with him.
6251978	eng	Tom faces 30 years to life in prison.
6251979	eng	I didn't have enough money for gas.
6251980	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be permitted to do that after his birthday.
6251981	eng	Tom expected us to do that yesterday.
6251982	eng	I didn't have anything I had to do.
6251983	eng	Tom knew that Mary had told everyone she was going to file for a divorce.
6251984	eng	Tom eventually gave up and went home.
6251985	eng	I didn't go to Boston last weekend.
6251986	eng	Tom knew he should say something to Mary, but he didn't know what to say.
6251987	eng	Tom emptied the box of its contents.
6251988	eng	I didn't get up early this morning.
6251989	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do everything John has told her to do.
6251990	eng	Tom earned his living as a guitarist.
6251991	eng	I didn't get here until after dark.
6251992	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John thinks she should do.
6251993	eng	Tom dumped everything out of the box.
6251994	eng	I didn't get here until about noon.
6251995	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John is asking her to do.
6251997	eng	I didn't expect to ever walk again.
6251998	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John has asked her to do.
6251999	eng	Tom doesn't want us to do that today.
6252000	eng	I didn't expect the job to be easy.
6252001	eng	Tom and I did our best to help Mary do everything that needed to be done.
6252002	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that that way.
6252003	eng	I didn't do what I was asked to do.
6252004	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she should do that.
6252005	eng	Tom doesn't want to be in Boston now.
6252006	eng	I didn't do what I promised I'd do.
6252007	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she has to do that.
6252008	eng	Tom doesn't think we need to do that.
6252009	eng	I didn't do everything I had to do.
6252010	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she had to do that.
6252011	eng	Tom doesn't think we have to do that.
6252012	eng	I didn't anticipate that happening.
6252013	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary what needs to be done.
6252014	eng	Tom doesn't think I ought to do that.
6252015	eng	I didn't answer any more questions.
6252016	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
6252017	eng	Tom doesn't seem to enjoy doing that.
6252018	eng	I didn't actually see the accident.
6252019	eng	You told Tom that I asked John to teach Mary how to do that, didn't you?
6252020	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be unhappy today.
6252021	eng	I definitely want to do that today.
6252022	eng	You didn't think Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that, did you?
6252023	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be in his office.
6252024	eng	I definitely want to do that again.
6252025	eng	Tom won't likely forget to tell Mary not to forget to water the flowers.
6252026	eng	Tom doesn't remember how he got home.
6252027	eng	I cut classes and went to the mall.
6252029	eng	Tom doesn't need any help doing that.
6252030	eng	I could get punished if I did that.
6252031	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that she should do that as soon as possible.
6252032	eng	Tom doesn't like the way you do that.
6252033	eng	I can't help you do that right now.
6252034	eng	Tom told Mary that it might be a good idea if she went there by bicycle.
6252035	eng	Tom doesn't like playing video games.
6252036	eng	I can't find my trumpet mouthpiece.
6252037	eng	Tom thought Mary would be interested in visiting one of the art museums.
6252038	eng	Tom doesn't like it when you do that.
6252039	eng	I can't decide what to do tomorrow.
6252040	eng	Tom said he wished he'd spent more money on the gift he bought for Mary.
6252041	eng	Tom doesn't like being told to hurry.
6252042	eng	I can come, too, if you want me to.
6252043	eng	Tom said he wanted to tell you how to do that, but Mary told him not to.
6252044	eng	Tom doesn't know a lot about animals.
6252045	eng	I came to Boston in search of work.
6252046	eng	Tom said he didn't have enough money to buy what Mary wanted him to buy.
6252047	eng	Tom doesn't have very good instincts.
6252048	eng	I bet it's not too hard to do that.
6252049	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not want to do that until it gets cooler.
6252050	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that, does he?
6252051	eng	I bet it's not much fun to do that.
6252052	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be required to do that until October.
6252054	eng	I assume you're willing to do that.
6252055	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that early tomorrow morning.
6252056	eng	Tom doesn't have time to read comics.
6252057	eng	I always have to do that by myself.
6252058	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that on such a cold day.
6252059	eng	Tom doesn't have everything he wants.
6252060	eng	How would you recommend we do that?
6252061	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6252062	eng	Tom doesn't have everything he needs.
6252063	eng	How often do you stay up all night?
6252064	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be required to do that in the near future.
6252065	eng	Tom doesn't have any help doing that.
6252066	eng	How often do you go to the library?
6252067	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that again.
6252068	eng	Tom doesn't feel he needs to do that.
6252069	eng	How much time do I have to do that?
6252070	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary plans to spend her summer vacation.
6252071	eng	Tom doesn't expect to stay very long.
6252072	eng	How many concerts have you been to?
6252073	eng	Tom knew it was only a matter of time before Mary found out what he did.
6252074	eng	Tom doesn't deserve to be re-elected.
6252075	eng	How long have you spent doing that?
6252076	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John is asking her to do.
6252077	eng	Tom doesn't care if his car is dirty.
6252078	eng	How do you celebrate your birthday?
6252079	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John has asked her to do.
6252080	eng	Tom doesn't blame you for doing that.
6252081	eng	How about doing that while we wait?
6252082	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John has told her to do.
6252083	eng	Tom doesn't believe he could do that.
6252084	eng	Have you ever been on a blind date?
6252085	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be able to convince John to stop doing that.
6252086	eng	Tom doesn't actually want to do that.
6252087	eng	Have you decided when you'll leave?
6252088	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be able to do that in less than three hours.
6252089	eng	Tom doesn't actually need to do that.
6252090	eng	Have you checked all the equipment?
6252091	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be able to convince John to stop doing that.
6252092	eng	Tom doesn't actually have to do that.
6252093	eng	Has all the equipment been checked?
6252094	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she didn't want to do that.
6252095	eng	Tom does that every Monday afternoon.
6252096	eng	Even though I was sick, I did that.
6252097	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she didn't need to do that.
6252098	eng	Tom does that all the time, you know.
6252099	eng	Even if it's raining, I'll do that.
6252100	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she didn't have to do that.
6252101	eng	Tom does take a shower every morning.
6252102	eng	Don't stay out in the sun too long.
6252103	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she ought to do that.
6252104	eng	Tom does everything he's asked to do.
6252105	eng	Don't forget to take your umbrella.
6252106	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she needs to do that.
6252107	eng	Tom died when the building collapsed.
6252108	eng	Don't do that unless I tell you to.
6252109	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6252110	eng	Tom died on his way home from church.
6252111	eng	Doing that likely won't be so easy.
6252112	eng	I don't think Tom would be interested in buying any of Mary's paintings.
6252113	eng	Tom died of cancer in 2013 in Boston.
6252114	eng	Doing it that way wouldn't be safe.
6252115	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was faster at doing that than Alice.
6252116	eng	Tom died of a heart attack last year.
6252117	eng	Doing it that way wouldn't be easy.
6252118	eng	Tom told Mary not to waste her time trying to convince John to do that.
6252119	eng	Tom died of a heart attack in Boston.
6252120	eng	Does everyone know what gravity is?
6252121	eng	Tom should at least tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that anymore.
6252122	eng	Tom died in prison from tuberculosis.
6252123	eng	Do you want me to buy that for you?
6252124	eng	Tom should at least tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that anymore.
6252125	eng	Tom died in prison after three years.
6252126	eng	Do you usually do that by yourself?
6252127	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary didn't want to go to Boston with him.
6252128	eng	Tom died in October at the age of 30.
6252129	eng	Do you think it'll be hot tomorrow?
6252130	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't feel like doing that.
6252131	eng	Tom died in Boston three years later.
6252132	eng	Do you think Boston is a safe city?
6252133	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't able to read anything without her glasses on.
6252134	eng	Tom died in Boston of kidney failure.
6252135	eng	Do you still enjoy going to movies?
6252136	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he'd go to Boston with her.
6252137	eng	Tom died in Boston of a heart attack.
6252138	eng	Do you really want to do that here?
6252139	eng	Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
6252140	eng	Tom died before the rescuers arrived.
6252141	eng	Do you read books to your children?
6252142	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be permitted to do that in the near future.
6252143	eng	Tom died as a result of his injuries.
6252144	eng	Do you plan to continue doing that?
6252145	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really had to do that yesterday morning.
6252146	eng	Tom died Monday after a long illness.
6252147	eng	Do you know whose umbrella this is?
6252148	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be permitted to do that by herself.
6252149	eng	Tom didn't want to play golf anymore.
6252150	eng	Do you know a safer way to do that?
6252151	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that by himself.
6252152	eng	Tom didn't tell me he'd gotten fired.
6252153	eng	Didn't you know you had to do that?
6252154	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be allowed to do that after his birthday.
6252155	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who did that.
6252156	eng	Didn't you know that was happening?
6252157	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.
6252158	eng	Tom didn't really have to do a thing.
6252159	eng	Didn't you know about this already?
6252160	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary shouldn't be doing that by herself.
6252161	eng	Tom didn't play the rest of the game.
6252162	eng	Did you fill out the questionnaire?
6252163	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John has told her to do.
6252164	eng	Tom didn't play in the third quarter.
6252165	eng	Could you tell me how you did that?
6252166	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to tell John what needed to be done.
6252167	eng	Tom didn't know that I could do that.
6252168	eng	Could you pick up that book for me?
6252169	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him he didn't need to do that.
6252170	eng	Tom didn't know if he had to do that.
6252171	eng	Could you make me another sandwich?
6252172	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him he didn't have to do that.
6252173	eng	Tom didn't know how to play the game.
6252174	eng	Could you give us any more details?
6252175	eng	Tom could've been quicker at doing that than Mary if he'd tried harder.
6252176	eng	Tom didn't have the money to do that.
6252177	eng	Could you explain how you did that?
6252178	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary well enough to know that she won't do that.
6252179	eng	Tom didn't have everything he needed.
6252180	eng	Could I borrow a couple of dollars?
6252181	eng	It was very naive of Tom to think Mary would believe a story like that.
6252182	eng	Tom didn't get here until about noon.
6252183	eng	Can you stay in Boston for a while?
6252184	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't have come this early if Mary hadn't asked him to.
6252185	eng	Tom didn't do what we told him to do.
6252186	eng	Both of my ex-wives live in Boston.
6252187	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary about what happened.
6252188	eng	Tom didn't do what I asked him to do.
6252189	eng	Both of my brothers are in custody.
6252190	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be faster at doing that than Mary.
6252191	eng	Tom didn't come to work by car today.
6252192	eng	Both of my brothers are doing that.
6252193	eng	I don't know where Tom and Mary are planning to go for their honeymoon.
6252194	eng	Tom did whatever we wanted him to do.
6252195	eng	Aren't you going to come to Boston?
6252196	eng	I didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary what time the meeting was.
6252197	eng	Tom did what he thought he should do.
6252198	eng	Are you still reluctant to do that?
6252199	eng	Tom was through doing that by the time Mary offered to help him do it.
6252200	eng	Tom did what he felt he needed to do.
6252201	eng	Are you still permitted to do that?
6252202	eng	Tom was in the kitchen making breakfast when Mary knocked on his door.
6252203	eng	Tom did that without saying anything.
6252205	eng	Tom thought Mary wouldn't be able to convince John to stop doing that.
6252206	eng	Tom did that without asking for help.
6252207	eng	Are you still a straight-A student?
6252208	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary that he doesn't know how to do that.
6252209	eng	Tom did that for himself, not for us.
6252210	eng	Are you looking for an interpreter?
6252211	eng	Tom should at least tell Mary that he doesn't want to do that anymore.
6252212	eng	Tom did that for himself, not for me.
6252213	eng	Are you going to go see that movie?
6252214	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary actually did her homework by herself.
6252215	eng	Tom did that better than we expected.
6252216	eng	Are you a native speaker of French?
6252217	eng	Tom said it looked like Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
6252218	eng	Tom did that because you told him to.
6252219	eng	Your speech was quite interesting.
6252220	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be permitted to do that by herself.
6252221	eng	Tom did that because he was asked to.
6252222	eng	Your parents must be proud of you.
6252223	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really enjoys playing tennis with John.
6252224	eng	Tom did that as he was instructed to.
6252225	eng	Your office looks a lot like mine.
6252226	eng	Tom said he didn't think it was a good idea to permit Mary to do that.
6252227	eng	Tom did exactly what he wanted to do.
6252228	eng	Your advice didn't help me at all.
6252229	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be required to do that by herself.
6252230	eng	Tom did exactly as he was told to do.
6252231	eng	Your French is quite good already.
6252232	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6252233	eng	Tom did everything he promised to do.
6252234	eng	Your French is hard to understand.
6252235	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6252236	eng	Tom described the man who mugged him.
6252237	eng	You've lost your key, haven't you?
6252238	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be permitted to do that next weekend.
6252239	eng	Tom denies that he paid ransom money.
6252240	eng	You've lost your job, haven't you?
6252241	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wants him to go to Boston with her.
6252242	eng	Tom definitely won't do that anymore.
6252243	eng	You've grown since I last saw you.
6252244	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is intending to do that or not.
6252245	eng	Tom definitely has a lot of problems.
6252246	eng	You're too young to be left alone.
6252247	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do everything John wants her to do.
6252248	eng	Tom decided to do something about it.
6252249	eng	You're the shortest person I know.
6252250	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary didn't want to do that.
6252251	eng	Tom decided not to do that after all.
6252252	eng	You're the right man for this job.
6252253	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary didn't need to do that.
6252254	eng	Tom crawled out from under the table.
6252255	eng	You're the only vegetarian I know.
6252256	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary didn't have to do that.
6252257	eng	Tom couldn't stop us from doing that.
6252258	eng	You're the only one who does that.
6252259	eng	I'm quite sure Tom didn't know Mary had a much higher salary than his.
6252260	eng	Tom couldn't stop me from doing that.
6252261	eng	You're the one who should do that.
6252262	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she should do that.
6252263	eng	Tom couldn't explain how he did that.
6252264	eng	You're the one who has to do that.
6252265	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary she has to do that.
6252266	eng	Tom could no longer restrain himself.
6252267	eng	You're not permitted to do that here.
6252268	eng	You knew that Tom wanted Mary to ask John not to do that, didn't you?
6252269	eng	Tom could get injured if he did that.
6252270	eng	You're likely to do that, aren't you?
6252271	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she needs to be more careful in the future.
6252272	eng	Tom could do that again if he had to.
6252273	eng	You're a veterinarian, aren't you?
6252274	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he can't do that without her help.
6252275	eng	Tom could do a lot of things for you.
6252276	eng	You're a very talented songwriter.
6252277	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that on her own.
6252278	eng	Tom could be the next one to do that.
6252279	eng	You're a very good French teacher.
6252280	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that by herself.
6252281	eng	Tom could be the last one to do that.
6252282	eng	You're a very good French speaker.
6252283	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why Mary didn't do what she said she'd do.
6252284	eng	Tom could be sincere, but I doubt it.
6252285	eng	You're a truck driver, aren't you?
6252286	eng	Tom said he wished he'd spent more money on the gift he'd given Mary.
6252287	eng	Tom could be punished for doing that.
6252288	eng	You're a student, too, aren't you?
6252289	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't parked his car in front of Mary's house.
6252290	eng	Tom could be just the person we need.
6252291	eng	You're a pediatrician, aren't you?
6252292	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not want to do that during the summer.
6252293	eng	Tom could be forgiven for doing that.
6252294	eng	You're a heavy smoker, aren't you?
6252295	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that by herself.
6252296	eng	Tom could be excused from doing that.
6252297	eng	You're a friendly guy, aren't you?
6252298	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be allowed to do that in the near future.
6252299	eng	Tom could be arrested for doing that.
6252300	eng	You're a better swimmer than I am.
6252301	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wanted to do that yesterday afternoon.
6252302	eng	Tom could almost pass for a teenager.
6252303	eng	You're a baseball fan, aren't you?
6252304	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needed to do that this morning.
6252305	eng	Tom continued doing that for a while.
6252306	eng	You'll keep doing that, won't you?
6252307	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that very well.
6252308	eng	Tom confessed his sins to the priest.
6252309	eng	You'll help us do that, won't you?
6252310	eng	Tom said he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that on her own.
6252311	eng	Tom complained that his stomach hurt.
6252312	eng	You'll help me do that, won't you?
6252313	eng	Tom said he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that by herself.
6252314	eng	Tom comes to see me almost every day.
6252315	eng	You'll have the chance to do that.
6252316	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be quicker at doing that than John.
6252317	eng	Tom comes from a very musical family.
6252318	eng	You'll have difficulty doing that.
6252319	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be the one responsible for what happened.
6252320	eng	Tom climbed to the top of the ladder.
6252321	eng	You'll be rich and famous someday.
6252322	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be permitted to do that at night.
6252323	eng	Tom cleaned the house all by himself.
6252324	eng	You'll be punished for doing that.
6252325	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that by herself.
6252326	eng	Tom claimed he acted in self-defense.
6252327	eng	You'll be excused from doing that.
6252328	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
6252329	eng	Tom certainly isn't ready to do that.
6252330	eng	You'd do that again, wouldn't you?
6252331	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be permitted to do that this week.
6252332	eng	Tom can't play the trumpet very well.
6252333	eng	You won't have to do that anymore.
6252334	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that as quickly as possible.
6252335	eng	Tom can't help you do that right now.
6252336	eng	You won't do that today, will you?
6252337	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6252338	eng	Tom can't come to Boston this summer.
6252339	eng	You won't do that alone, will you?
6252340	eng	Tom refused to tell me why he and Mary weren't talking to each other.
6252341	eng	Tom can do that with his eyes closed.
6252342	eng	You won't do that again, will you?
6252343	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is going to be tomorrow morning.
6252344	eng	Tom can do that again if he wants to.
6252345	eng	You were foolish to do that again.
6252346	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John thinks she should do.
6252347	eng	Tom began to do that three years ago.
6252348	eng	You were cute when you were a kid.
6252349	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do everything John asks her to do.
6252350	eng	Tom began doing that three years ago.
6252351	eng	You want to go with us, don't you?
6252352	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John wants her to do.
6252353	eng	Tom began doing that three weeks ago.
6252354	eng	You suggested that we not do that.
6252355	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John tells her to do.
6252356	eng	Tom began doing that at an early age.
6252357	eng	You shouldn't have had to do that.
6252358	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John thinks she should do.
6252359	eng	Tom became a schoolteacher in Boston.
6252360	eng	You shouldn't do that by yourself.
6252361	eng	Tom has been waiting for Mary all morning, but she still hasn't come.
6252362	eng	Tom baked these cookies this morning.
6252363	eng	You should've done that years ago.
6252364	eng	Tom explained to Mary why it would be a good idea for her to do that.
6252365	eng	Tom backed the car out of the garage.
6252366	eng	You should've done that weeks ago.
6252367	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very interested in what Mary was talking about.
6252368	eng	Tom backed his car down the driveway.
6252369	eng	You should've done that last week.
6252370	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what time John was supposed to meet Alice.
6252371	eng	Tom assured us that he would do that.
6252372	eng	You should pay your bills on time.
6252373	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary not to do that.
6252374	eng	Tom assured us that he could do that.
6252375	eng	You should listen to your teacher.
6252376	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to convince Mary to stop doing that.
6252377	eng	Tom assured me that he would do that.
6252378	eng	You should go ahead and get ready.
6252379	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to convince Mary to quit doing that.
6252380	eng	Tom assured me that he could do that.
6252381	eng	You should do that somewhere else.
6252382	eng	I didn't know why Tom didn't want Mary to do that until John told me.
6252383	eng	Tom asked us why we hadn't done that.
6252384	eng	You should do that someplace else.
6252385	eng	You told Tom I wanted Mary to teach John how to do that, didn't you?
6252386	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to do that.
6252387	eng	You should do that if you want to.
6252388	eng	You should probably tell Tom that you want him to help Mary do that.
6252389	eng	Tom asked me if I had ever done that.
6252390	eng	You should buy yourself a new car.
6252391	eng	You didn't know that Tom was supposed to help Mary do that, did you?
6252392	eng	Tom announced his retirement in 2013.
6252393	eng	You should be able to do that now.
6252394	eng	Tom told Mary to stop complaining, but she just kept on complaining.
6252395	eng	We always love those who admire us and we do not always love those we admire.
6252396	eng	Tom announced his decision on Monday.
6252397	eng	You seemed to be eager to do that.
6252398	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be careful not to drop the bottles.
6252399	eng	Tom and I've recently started dating.
6252400	eng	You seem to be a little bit crazy.
6252401	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John would be the next one to do that.
6252402	eng	Tom and I've decided to get divorced.
6252403	eng	You really do drink a lot, do you?
6252404	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be lonely if she lived all alone in the woods.
6252405	eng	Tom and I've been dating for a while.
6252406	eng	You promised you'd do that for us.
6252407	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary wants him to meet her in the park.
6252408	eng	Tom and I'll go camping this weekend.
6252409	eng	You promised not to do that again.
6252410	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that next week.
6252411	eng	Tom and I'll get married next spring.
6252412	eng	You often go to Boston, don't you?
6252413	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't able to read anything without her glasses.
6252414	eng	Tom and I'll be waiting in the lobby.
6252415	eng	You never seem to do that anymore.
6252416	eng	Tom said that Mary has wanted to learn how to drive for a long time.
6252417	eng	Tom and I were there three years ago.
6252418	eng	You need to do that every morning.
6252419	eng	Tom said that Mary has been wanting to visit Boston for a long time.
6252420	eng	Tom and I were the ones who did that.
6252421	eng	You need help doing that, I think.
6252422	eng	Tom said that Mary doesn't think John could ever do that by himself.
6252423	eng	Tom and I were born in the same city.
6252424	eng	You may use this room if you want.
6252425	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he was going to do that.
6252426	eng	Tom and I were at home all afternoon.
6252427	eng	You may shut the door if you like.
6252428	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
6252429	eng	Tom and I went to the beach together.
6252430	eng	You may do that wherever you want.
6252431	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was probably not having any fun doing that.
6252432	eng	Tom and I went for a drive yesterday.
6252433	eng	You may do that today if you like.
6252434	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself.
6252435	eng	Tom and I went duck hunting together.
6252436	eng	You may do that anywhere you want.
6252437	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would be amused by what was happening.
6252438	eng	Tom and I wanted to do that together.
6252439	eng	You may do that again if you like.
6252440	eng	Tom said he didn't know what Mary's reasons for not doing that were.
6252441	eng	Tom and I want to tell you something.
6252442	eng	You look like you'd like to leave.
6252443	eng	Tom said he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that next week.
6252444	eng	Tom and I used to argue all the time.
6252445	eng	You look like you don't feel well.
6252446	eng	Tom said Mary would need at least $300 to buy everything she needed.
6252447	eng	Tom and I took turns driving the car.
6252448	eng	You look a little bit like a girl.
6252449	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who was able to do that without help.
6252450	eng	Tom and I tell each other everything.
6252451	eng	You know we don't have to do that.
6252452	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be faster at doing that than John.
6252453	eng	Tom and I sometimes do that together.
6252454	eng	You knew this already, didn't you?
6252455	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be better at doing that than John.
6252456	eng	Tom and I sometime hang out together.
6252457	eng	You have to have money to do that.
6252458	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6252459	eng	Tom and I sing in the choir together.
6252460	eng	You have to do that every morning.
6252461	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that anymore.
6252462	eng	Tom and I see each other quite often.
6252463	eng	You had plenty of time to do that.
6252464	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be permitted to do that by himself.
6252465	eng	Tom and I sat across from each other.
6252466	eng	You don't usually do that, do you?
6252467	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be allowed to do that next weekend.
6252468	eng	Tom and I played in the park all day.
6252469	eng	You don't seem to want to do that.
6252470	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be permitted to do that by herself.
6252471	eng	Tom and I played chess all afternoon.
6252472	eng	You don't plan to do that, do you?
6252473	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be required to do that by himself.
6252474	eng	Tom and I often go shopping together.
6252475	eng	You don't need to do that, do you?
6252476	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is good at doing that or not.
6252477	eng	Tom and I never criticize each other.
6252478	eng	You don't mind doing that, do you?
6252479	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary wants him to put her suitcases.
6252480	eng	Tom and I never argue about anything.
6252481	eng	You don't look like you're sleepy.
6252482	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary wants him to plant the lettuce.
6252483	eng	Tom and I like the same kind of food.
6252484	eng	You don't look like you're lonely.
6252485	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary should be doing that by herself.
6252486	eng	Tom and I just want to be left alone.
6252487	eng	You don't like to do that, do you?
6252488	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary needs to do that again tomorrow.
6252489	eng	Tom and I have trouble getting along.
6252490	eng	You don't like doing that, do you?
6252491	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is the one who needs to do that.
6252492	eng	Tom and I have many things in common.
6252493	eng	You don't have to do that, do you?
6252494	eng	Tom is the only man other than her father that Mary has ever kissed.
6252495	eng	Tom and I had a nice dinner together.
6252496	eng	You don't do that anymore, do you?
6252497	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do whatever John wants her to do.
6252498	eng	Tom and I go to the same supermarket.
6252499	eng	You don't deny doing that, do you?
6252500	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John is asking her to do.
6252501	eng	Tom and I folded the sheets together.
6252502	eng	You do want to do that, don't you?
6252503	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John has asked her to do.
6252504	eng	Tom and I first met three months ago.
6252505	eng	You do that every week, don't you?
6252506	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John wants her to do.
6252507	eng	Tom and I enjoy each other's company.
6252508	eng	You didn't tell me not to do that.
6252509	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John thinks she should do.
6252510	eng	Tom and I don't speak French at home.
6252511	eng	You didn't really need to do that.
6252512	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John told her to do.
6252513	eng	Tom and I do lots of things together.
6252514	eng	You didn't look like you were mad.
6252515	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do everything John asks her to do.
6252516	eng	Tom and I aren't supposed to do that.
6252517	eng	You didn't find anything, did you?
6252518	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John is asking her to do.
6252519	eng	Tom and I are professional musicians.
6252520	eng	You didn't do that again, did you?
6252521	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John has asked her to do.
6252522	eng	Tom and I are perfect for each other.
6252523	eng	You could be doing that right now.
6252524	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary wanted to go to Boston with him or not.
6252525	eng	Tom and I are on our way there now.
6252526	eng	You can sleep here if you want to.
6252527	eng	I thought Tom might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
6252528	eng	Tom and I are on the same wavelength.
6252529	eng	You can do that today if you like.
6252530	eng	I didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary what needed to be done.
6252531	eng	Tom and I are both unable to do that.
6252532	eng	You can do that better than I can.
6252533	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary to ask John not to do that, didn't you?
6252534	eng	Tom and I always seem to be fighting.
6252535	eng	You can do that again if you want.
6252536	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6252537	eng	Tom and I almost always eat together.
6252538	eng	You can come, too, if you want to.
6252539	eng	You didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary to do that, did you?
6252540	eng	Tom always asks me the same question.
6252541	eng	You can come tomorrow if you like.
6252542	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that if he'd known it would make Mary angry.
6252543	eng	Tom almost always eats lunch with us.
6252544	eng	Would you unlock the gate, please?
6252545	eng	Tom wanted to find out when Mary was planning to finish doing that.
6252546	eng	Tom agreed that we shouldn't do that.
6252547	eng	Would you unlock the door, please?
6252548	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be careful not to make John angry.
6252549	eng	Tom admitted that he knew the secret.
6252550	eng	Would you pass the butter, please?
6252551	eng	Tom told Mary that it might be better if she went there by bicycle.
6252552	eng	Tom's wife is just as tall as he is.
6252553	eng	Would you like to do that with us?
6252554	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was difficult to get along with.
6252555	eng	Tom's teaching career began in 2013.
6252556	eng	Would you be reluctant to do that?
6252557	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was amused by what was going on.
6252558	eng	Tom's mother died when he was three.
6252559	eng	Would you all please step outside?
6252560	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she needs to be more careful from now on.
6252561	eng	Tom's last name is possibly Jackson.
6252562	eng	Women and girls shouldn't do that.
6252563	eng	Tom should tell Mary he wants to quit his job and find another one.
6252564	eng	Tom's interest in music began early.
6252565	eng	Will I have time to do that today?
6252566	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary to come back home as soon as she can.
6252567	eng	Tom's injury appears to have healed.
6252568	eng	Why don't you have dinner with us?
6252569	eng	Tom seemed to know that Mary didn't do what she was supposed to do.
6252570	eng	Tom's first wife was really strange.
6252571	eng	Why don't we get something to eat?
6252572	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she didn't want to do that.
6252573	eng	Tom's first girlfriend was a blonde.
6252574	eng	Why do some people like to gamble?
6252575	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she didn't need to do that.
6252576	eng	Tom's first girlfriend was Canadian.
6252577	eng	Who's the tallest person you know?
6252578	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she didn't have to do that.
6252579	eng	Tom's death still remains a mystery.
6252580	eng	Who's the richest person you know?
6252581	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
6252582	eng	Tom's business has done really well.
6252583	eng	Who told you you couldn't do that?
6252584	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't enjoy doing that.
6252585	eng	Tom's brothers are still in custody.
6252586	eng	Who do you intend to do that with?
6252587	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary to show John how to do that.
6252588	eng	Tom's brothers are still doing that.
6252589	eng	Which of your brothers is younger?
6252590	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be sleeping by the time he got home.
6252591	eng	Tom wouldn't like it if we did that.
6252592	eng	Where should we hang this picture?
6252593	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that without any help.
6252594	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if I did that.
6252595	eng	What's your reason for doing that?
6252596	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
6252597	eng	Tom would want to do that, I'm sure.
6252598	eng	What's your main source of income?
6252599	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be permitted to do that by herself.
6252600	eng	Tom would never go to Boston by bus.
6252601	eng	What's the longest river in Japan?
6252602	eng	Tom said Mary thought she was the only one who knew how to do that.
6252603	eng	Tom would be terrible at doing that.
6252604	eng	What's the easiest way to do that?
6252605	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that at night.
6252606	eng	Tom would be foolish not to do that.
6252607	eng	What time do you usually get home?
6252608	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be permitted to do that by herself.
6252609	eng	Tom worked for three hours straight.
6252610	eng	What did you do yesterday morning?
6252611	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that this week.
6252612	eng	Tom won't likely be watching TV now.
6252613	eng	We've been ordered not to do that.
6252614	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that by himself.
6252615	eng	Tom won't likely be done doing that.
6252616	eng	We've been invaded by our enemies.
6252617	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not need to do that until next Monday.
6252618	eng	Tom won't get the chance to do that.
6252619	eng	We've all done that at least once.
6252620	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that until next Monday.
6252621	eng	Tom won't figure out how to do that.
6252622	eng	We're not allowed to do that here.
6252623	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be required to do that by herself.
6252625	eng	We'll probably be able to do that.
6252626	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be permitted to do that by himself.
6252627	eng	Tom won't be here when you get here.
6252628	eng	We'd be lucky if we could do that.
6252629	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6252630	eng	Tom won't be able to do that either.
6252631	eng	We won't stay in Boston very long.
6252632	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything she needed to do this afternoon.
6252633	eng	Tom will probably refuse to do that.
6252634	eng	We won't come to Boston next week.
6252635	eng	Tom needed to make sure that Mary knew what she was supposed to do.
6252636	eng	Tom will probably help a little bit.
6252637	eng	We won't be in Boston next Monday.
6252638	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John has told her to do.
6252639	eng	Tom will probably do that next week.
6252640	eng	We were told not to do that again.
6252641	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do anything John asks her to do.
6252642	eng	Tom will probably become frustrated.
6252643	eng	We rarely see monkeys around here.
6252644	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do whatever John tells her to do.
6252645	eng	Tom will probably be grumpy all day.
6252646	eng	We only sell three kinds of cakes.
6252647	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John is asking her to do.
6252648	eng	Tom will probably be back by Monday.
6252649	eng	We never stay in Boston very long.
6252650	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John has asked her to do.
6252651	eng	Tom will likely be ready to do that.
6252652	eng	We never should've visited Boston.
6252653	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John has told her to do.
6252654	eng	Tom will have the chance to do that.
6252655	eng	We never should've gone to Boston.
6252656	eng	Tom doesn't think this is the first time Mary has tried to do that.
6252657	eng	Tom will go back to Boston tomorrow.
6252658	eng	We need to correct these problems.
6252659	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be doing that on a hot day like today.
6252660	eng	Tom will do what he can to help you.
6252661	eng	We might be in Boston next spring.
6252662	eng	Tom doesn't know where John and Mary are going for their honeymoon.
6252663	eng	Tom will come to Boston this summer.
6252664	eng	We just visited Boston last month.
6252665	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she wanted to do that.
6252666	eng	Tom will come to Boston next Monday.
6252667	eng	We had dinner at a new restaurant.
6252668	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she needed to do that.
6252669	eng	Tom will come on the twentieth, too.
6252670	eng	We had a drop in sales last month.
6252671	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't have enough money to pay all her bills.
6252672	eng	Tom will be the next one to do that.
6252673	eng	Those statistics aren't available.
6252674	eng	Tom didn't have to tell Mary to do that. She'd have done it anyway.
6252675	eng	Tom will be the last one to do that.
6252676	eng	This river dries up in the summer.
6252677	eng	Tom and Mary were engaged for three months before they got married.
6252678	eng	Tom will be outside waiting for you.
6252679	eng	This project is only 30% complete.
6252680	eng	Tom and Mary don't play ping-pong together as much as they used to.
6252681	eng	Tom will be happy he didn't do that.
6252682	eng	This place looks like a graveyard.
6252683	eng	Tom and Mary are still not doing what they're supposed to be doing.
6252684	eng	Tom will be forgiven for doing that.
6252685	eng	This must be some kind of mistake.
6252686	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what Mary told him he was supposed to do.
6252687	eng	Tom will be excused from doing that.
6252688	eng	This morning's meeting was boring.
6252689	eng	Tom and Mary met three years ago when they were students in Boston.
6252690	eng	Tom went to the park to play tennis.
6252691	eng	This isn't a very comfortable bed.
6252692	eng	I've never told Tom that Mary and I used to go out with each other.
6252693	eng	Tom went to Boston with his parents.
6252694	eng	This is an exception to this rule.
6252695	eng	I think Tom wouldn't have been able to do that without Mary's help.
6252696	eng	Tom went straight home after school.
6252697	eng	This is a non-profit organization.
6252698	eng	I don't think Tom will be able to convince Mary to stop doing that.
6252699	eng	Tom wasn't interested in doing that.
6252700	eng	This is a mainly residential area.
6252701	eng	I didn't know why Tom and Mary hated each other until John told me.
6252702	eng	Tom was the first person to do that.
6252703	eng	This has been happening for years.
6252704	eng	Didn't you know that Tom would be upset if he saw you kissing Mary?
6252705	eng	Tom was the first person here today.
6252706	eng	These shoes don't match this suit.
6252707	eng	Tom, Mary, John and I played beach volleyball yesterday afternoon.
6252708	eng	Tom was the first one to be injured.
6252709	eng	These lenses aren't scratch-proof.
6252710	eng	Tom thought that Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
6252711	eng	Tom was sure he could do that again.
6252712	eng	There are many people who do that.
6252713	eng	Tom thinks that if he hadn't done that, Mary would still be alive.
6252714	eng	Tom was one of those who were fired.
6252715	eng	The pencil rolled under the couch.
6252716	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be able to convince John to stop doing that.
6252717	eng	Tom was my neighbor three years ago.
6252718	eng	The past three days have been hot.
6252719	eng	Tom should've gone to Boston last week with Mary, but he couldn't.
6252720	eng	Tom was my neighbor for three years.
6252721	eng	The last three days have been hot.
6252722	eng	Tom should've asked Mary what time the meeting was going to start.
6252723	eng	Tom was finished doing that by 2:30.
6252725	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what time he's planning to get home.
6252726	eng	Tom was difficult to get along with.
6252727	eng	Thanks for what you did yesterday.
6252728	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he doesn't want her to do that.
6252729	eng	Tom was amused by what was going on.
6252730	eng	Some people here can speak French.
6252731	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he doesn't know how to do that.
6252732	eng	Tom was also present at the meeting.
6252733	eng	Shouldn't I be the one doing that?
6252734	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
6252735	eng	Tom wants to know why that happened.
6252736	eng	Please do that as soon as you can.
6252737	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him he didn't need to do that.
6252738	eng	Tom wants me to cook dinner for him.
6252739	eng	Perhaps you don't need to do that.
6252740	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him he didn't have to do that.
6252741	eng	Tom wanted me to do that, didn't he?
6252742	eng	People around here seldom do that.
6252743	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't go to Boston unless he goes with her.
6252744	eng	Tom used to work at the post office.
6252745	eng	Only adults are permitted do that.
6252746	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't do that unless he does that with her.
6252747	eng	Tom used to live in my neighborhood.
6252748	eng	Nobody said that it would be easy.
6252749	eng	Tom says he heard that Mary needed to find somewhere else to live.
6252750	eng	Tom used to be my saxophone teacher.
6252751	eng	My truck is still parked out back.
6252752	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't want to do that.
6252753	eng	Tom used to be able to swim 30 laps.
6252754	eng	My parents need to know the truth.
6252755	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't need to do that.
6252756	eng	Tom tried to show me how to do that.
6252757	eng	My house was damaged by the flood.
6252758	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't like doing that.
6252759	eng	Tom tried to kill himself last week.
6252760	eng	My first child was born last year.
6252761	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who didn't have to do that.
6252762	eng	Tom tried out for the baseball team.
6252763	eng	My daughter plays the violin well.
6252764	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the only one who knew how to do that.
6252766	eng	My approach is somewhat different.
6252767	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
6252768	eng	Tom told me you knew how to do that.
6252769	eng	My French has gotten a lot better.
6252770	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
6252771	eng	Tom told me why he couldn't do that.
6252772	eng	Monday will probably be a hot day.
6252773	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be permitted to do that by herself.
6252774	eng	Tom told me that he'll be back soon.
6252775	eng	Monday will likely be a windy day.
6252776	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that on such a hot day.
6252777	eng	Tom told me that he'd be supportive.
6252778	eng	Monday will likely be a rainy day.
6252779	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be required to do that by herself.
6252780	eng	Tom told me that he was embarrassed.
6252781	eng	Men and women do that differently.
6252782	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that by herself.
6252783	eng	Tom told me he was going to do that.
6252784	eng	Maybe it would be best to do that.
6252785	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really had to do that this morning.
6252786	eng	Tom thought you'd already done that.
6252787	eng	Mary isn't wearing lipstick today.
6252788	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really needed to do that by herself.
6252789	eng	Tom thought he'd be able to do that.
6252790	eng	Mary is the smartest woman I know.
6252791	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be the one who needs to do that.
6252792	eng	Tom thought he could do that for me.
6252793	eng	Mary is the shortest woman I know.
6252794	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be required to do that by herself.
6252795	eng	Tom teaches French five days a week.
6252796	eng	Mary is the quietest woman I know.
6252797	eng	Tom said Mary thought he was the only one who knew how to do that.
6252798	eng	Tom swore that he'd never done that.
6252799	eng	Mary is a daughter of a carpenter.
6252800	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be permitted to do that by himself.
6252801	eng	Tom swears he won't do that anymore.
6252802	eng	Mary got her belly button pierced.
6252803	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be allowed to do that by himself.
6252804	eng	Tom sure does that well, doesn't he?
6252805	eng	Many people have been complaining.
6252806	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that by herself.
6252807	eng	Tom stuck his pencil behind his ear.
6252808	eng	Make sure you don't do that again.
6252809	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be permitted to do that this evening.
6252810	eng	Tom still works several days a week.
6252811	eng	Just keep doing what you're doing.
6252812	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be required to do that by himself.
6252813	eng	Tom still like to do that sometimes.
6252814	eng	It's very nice of you to say that.
6252815	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
6252816	eng	Tom still just wants to stay in bed.
6252817	eng	It's painful to do that, isn't it?
6252818	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary and John don't like each other.
6252819	eng	Tom still isn't very good at skiing.
6252820	eng	It's not safe to drink that water.
6252821	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is good at swimming or not.
6252822	eng	Tom still isn't very good at French.
6252823	eng	It's necessary for you to do that.
6252824	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary intended to do that or not.
6252825	eng	Tom still hasn't washed his clothes.
6252826	eng	It's hot and humid here in Boston.
6252827	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is the one who has to do that.
6252828	eng	Tom still hasn't told me what to do.
6252829	eng	It's going to be tough to do that.
6252830	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary has to do that again tomorrow.
6252831	eng	Tom still hasn't found his passport.
6252832	eng	It'll probably be safe to do that.
6252833	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much time Mary will need to do that.
6252834	eng	Tom still does that whenever he can.
6252835	eng	It'll probably be easy to do that.
6252836	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much time Mary will have to do that.
6252837	eng	Tom still does that once in a while.
6252838	eng	It would've been wrong to do that.
6252839	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary well enough to know what she'll do.
6252840	eng	Tom stayed longer than he should've.
6252841	eng	It would've been tough to do that.
6252842	eng	Tom needs to make sure that Mary knows what she is supposed to do.
6252843	eng	Tom spent three months in Australia.
6252844	eng	It would've been smart to do that.
6252845	eng	Tom knows it's a matter of time before Mary finds out what he did.
6252846	eng	Tom spent the whole day watching TV.
6252847	eng	It would've been silly to do that.
6252848	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John has told her to do.
6252849	eng	Tom spent last Monday night in jail.
6252850	eng	It would've been cheap to do that.
6252851	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to tell John what he had to do.
6252852	eng	Tom spent a lot of time watching TV.
6252853	eng	It would be wise to do that again.
6252854	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary wasn't supposed to do that.
6252855	eng	Tom spends a lot of money traveling.
6252856	eng	It would be very silly to do that.
6252857	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him he needed to do that.
6252858	eng	Tom speaks three languages fluently.
6252859	eng	It would be very scary to do that.
6252860	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what time John was going to meet Alice.
6252861	eng	Tom sounded very tired on the phone.
6252862	eng	It would be very cruel to do that.
6252863	eng	Tom and his girlfriend often hang out with Mary and her boyfriend.
6252864	eng	Tom sometimes gets home around 2:30.
6252865	eng	It would be stupid not to do that.
6252866	eng	It was naive of Tom to think Mary would believe a story like that.
6252867	eng	Tom sold all his property in Boston.
6252868	eng	It would be ridiculous to do that.
6252869	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary not to do that.
6252870	eng	Tom slept through the entire ordeal.
6252871	eng	It would be nice to see you again.
6252872	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I didn't want Mary to go to Boston with him.
6252873	eng	Tom shouldn't have to do that again.
6252874	eng	It would be impossible to do that.
6252875	eng	You knew that Tom wanted Mary to ask John to do that, didn't you?
6252876	eng	Tom shouldn't have reacted that way.
6252877	eng	It would be good to see you again.
6252878	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary that he couldn't do that, didn't you?
6252879	eng	Tom shouldn't be the one doing that.
6252880	eng	It would be easy to do that again.
6252881	eng	You knew Tom was unlikely to ask Mary not to do that, didn't you?
6252882	eng	Tom shouldn't be allowed to compete.
6252883	eng	It would be depressing to do that.
6252884	eng	Tom would've gotten away with it if Mary hadn't seen you do that.
6252885	eng	Tom should've gotten here yesterday.
6252886	eng	It took me three hours to do that.
6252887	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary to come back home as soon as she can.
6252888	eng	Tom should've done that last summer.
6252889	eng	It should've been easy to do that.
6252890	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he wants to find a higher-paying job.
6252891	eng	Tom should've chosen something else.
6252892	eng	It looks as if it'll quit raining.
6252893	eng	Tom was sitting in the middle of the front row at Mary's concert.
6252894	eng	Tom should've been more cooperative.
6252895	eng	It doesn't look like you're tired.
6252896	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John would be reluctant to do that.
6252897	eng	Tom should send a letter of apology.
6252898	eng	It doesn't look like you're ready.
6252899	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had gone to Boston with Alice.
6252900	eng	Tom should be in Boston next Monday.
6252901	eng	It doesn't look like you're happy.
6252902	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to stop doing that.
6252903	eng	Tom should be even better next year.
6252904	eng	It doesn't look like you're angry.
6252905	eng	Tom thinks Mary wants to do that, but she doesn't really want to.
6252906	eng	Tom seldom, if ever, goes to church.
6252907	eng	Is there any other way to do that?
6252908	eng	Tom thinks Mary needs to do that, but she doesn't really need to.
6252909	eng	Tom seldom goes to places like that.
6252910	eng	Is there an easier way to do that?
6252911	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she should do that as soon as possible.
6252912	eng	Tom seldom does that in the morning.
6252913	eng	Is there a cheaper way to do that?
6252914	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to forget to water the flowers.
6252915	eng	Tom seems to know what he should do.
6252916	eng	If you don't hurry, we'll be late.
6252918	eng	Tom seems to know what he has to do.
6252919	eng	If it stops raining, I'll do that.
6252920	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary didn't want to do that.
6252921	eng	Tom seems to be feeling discouraged.
6252922	eng	If it doesn't rain, we'll do that.
6252923	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary didn't need to do that.
6252924	eng	Tom seems amused by what's going on.
6252925	eng	I've tried doing that three times.
6252926	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary didn't have to do that.
6252927	eng	Tom seemed to be willing to do that.
6252928	eng	I've seen you do that several times.
6252929	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary could do that without some help.
6252930	eng	Tom seemed to be enjoying the party.
6252931	eng	I've only been to Boston one time.
6252932	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that.
6252933	eng	Tom scored three goals for our team.
6252934	eng	I've just now finished doing that.
6252935	eng	Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo with Mary on their next date.
6252936	eng	Tom says we have to start somewhere.
6252937	eng	I've filled out the questionnaire.
6252938	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be asleep by the time he got home.
6252939	eng	Tom says there's no need to do that.
6252940	eng	I've decided to do that every day.
6252941	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be permitted to do that again.
6252942	eng	Tom says the plan isn't good enough.
6252943	eng	I've decided that I won't do that.
6252944	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be required to do that right away.
6252945	eng	Tom says that the noise bothers him.
6252946	eng	I've been wanting to do that, too.
6252947	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be required to do that by herself.
6252948	eng	Tom says that isn't a major problem.
6252949	eng	I've been forgiven for doing that.
6252950	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be allowed to do that by herself.
6252951	eng	Tom says that he intends to do that.
6252952	eng	I've been asked not do that again.
6252953	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really likes doing that very much.
6252954	eng	Tom says he's too old to start over.
6252955	eng	I've always dreamed of doing that.
6252956	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be difficult to get along with.
6252957	eng	Tom says he's spoken with the manager.
6252958	eng	I'm the only one who has to leave.
6252959	eng	Tom said Mary thought she was the only one who wanted to do that.
6252960	eng	Tom says he's proud of his children.
6252961	eng	I'm the only one who has a camera.
6252962	eng	Tom said Mary thought she was the only one who needed to do that.
6252963	eng	Tom says he's hoping he can do that.
6252965	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be required to do that again.
6252966	eng	Tom says he's done that three times.
6252967	eng	I'm sure that's what I need to do.
6252968	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that by herself.
6252969	eng	Tom says he's been to Boston before.
6252970	eng	I'm sure that's what I have to do.
6252971	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that by himself.
6252972	eng	Tom says he's been shot three times.
6252973	eng	I'm sure that's not what happened.
6252974	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be allowed to do that by himself.
6252975	eng	Tom says he's been asked to do that.
6252976	eng	I'm still not very good at skiing.
6252977	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not want to do that this afternoon.
6252978	eng	Tom says he's already learned a lot.
6252979	eng	I'm still not very good at French.
6252980	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be required to do that anymore.
6252981	eng	Tom says he thinks we could do that.
6252982	eng	I'm still not finished doing that.
6252983	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be permitted to do that by himself.
6252984	eng	Tom says he thinks he won't do that.
6252985	eng	I'm not working in Boston anymore.
6252986	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is good at dancing or not.
6252987	eng	Tom says he plans to stay in Boston.
6252988	eng	I'm not sure who I should talk to.
6252989	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is good at cooking or not.
6252990	eng	Tom says he misses his family a lot.
6252991	eng	I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
6252992	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary intends to do that or not.
6252993	eng	Tom says he hasn't joined any clubs.
6252994	eng	I'm not happy about the situation.
6252995	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary already knows how to do that.
6252996	eng	Tom says he feels taken for granted.
6252997	eng	I'm not good at remembering names.
6252998	eng	Tom probably doesn't know he's not supposed to help Mary do that.
6252999	eng	Tom says he doesn't wish to do that.
6253000	eng	I'm not going to help you do that.
6253001	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary well enough to ask her to do that.
6253002	eng	Tom says he doesn't need to do that.
6253003	eng	I'm not afraid of spiders anymore.
6253004	eng	Tom finally managed to persuade Mary to go to the dance with him.
6253005	eng	Tom says he doesn't have to do that.
6253006	eng	I'm going to try to do that today.
6253007	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be doing that if she didn't want to.
6253008	eng	Tom says he can do that blindfolded.
6253009	eng	I'm going to do that next weekend.
6253010	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be able to do that without some help.
6253011	eng	Tom says he believes he can do that.
6253012	eng	I'm glad you were able to do that.
6253013	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary well enough to know that she won't do that.
6253014	eng	Tom says he always does it this way.
6253015	eng	I'm eager to learn how to do that.
6253016	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be able to do that without some help.
6253017	eng	Tom sat there with his legs crossed.
6253018	eng	I'm convinced that that'll happen.
6253019	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary wasn't supposed to do that.
6253020	eng	Tom said you're a terrible roommate.
6253021	eng	I'm both a singer and a guitarist.
6253022	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary wanted to do that.
6253023	eng	Tom said you should be more careful.
6253024	eng	I'll tell you what you have to do.
6253025	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary needed to do that.
6253026	eng	Tom said there was still work to do.
6253027	eng	I'll do whatever you ask me to do.
6253028	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew who John was going to ask to the prom.
6253029	eng	Tom said the team remains confident.
6253030	eng	I'll do that today if I have time.
6253031	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what kind of hotel John had stayed at.
6253032	eng	Tom said the heat didn't bother him.
6253033	eng	I'll buy what I need at that shop.
6253034	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew the name of the book John was reading.
6253035	eng	Tom said the fire wasn't deliberate.
6253036	eng	I'll be happy to buy that for you.
6253037	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't agree on what to buy John for his birthday.
6253038	eng	Tom said the earthquake woke him up.
6253039	eng	I'd understand it if you were mad.
6253040	eng	The only reason Tom came to Boston was because Mary asked him to.
6253041	eng	Tom said the concert was quite good.
6253042	eng	I'd like to go to Boston with you.
6253043	eng	I told Tom that I thought Mary might be interested in doing that.
6253044	eng	Tom said the cold didn't bother him.
6253045	eng	I'd be happy to help you if I can.
6253046	eng	I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary was born.
6253047	eng	Tom said the children all get along.
6253048	eng	I wouldn't mind doing that at all.
6253049	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary what to do.
6253050	eng	Tom said that's definitely not true.
6253051	eng	I would never consider doing that.
6253052	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary to do that.
6253053	eng	Tom said that'll likely happen soon.
6253054	eng	I wonder whether I should do that.
6253055	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I didn't want Mary to go to Boston with me.
6253056	eng	Tom said that we need to be careful.
6253057	eng	I won't visit Boston on this trip.
6253058	eng	Didn't you know Tom's salary is more than double what Mary makes?
6253059	eng	Tom said that we have to be careful.
6253060	eng	I won't have to do that by myself.
6253061	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to work at the same place Mary does now?
6253062	eng	Tom said that wasn't a major factor.
6253063	eng	I won't be doing that from now on.
6253064	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary he was going to do that, didn't you?
6253065	eng	Tom said that the heat bothered him.
6253066	eng	I won't be able to do that either.
6253067	eng	You knew Tom wanted Mary to ask John not to do that, didn't you?
6253068	eng	Tom said that probably won't happen.
6253069	eng	I won't allow you guys to do that.
6253070	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that he doesn't know how to do that.
6253071	eng	Tom said that isn't the only reason.
6253072	eng	I wish you wouldn't do that again.
6253073	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he'll never do anything to hurt her.
6253074	eng	Tom said that he was ready to leave.
6253075	eng	I wish I hadn't gone to the party.
6253076	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6253077	eng	Tom said that he was a little tired.
6253078	eng	I wish I hadn't eaten so much pie.
6253079	eng	Tom told Mary that he was the one responsible for what happened.
6253080	eng	Tom said that he really did do that.
6253081	eng	I wish I hadn't bet on that horse.
6253082	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was the first one to do that.
6253083	eng	Tom said that he intends to do that.
6253084	eng	I wasn't sure I needed to do that.
6253085	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was interested in doing that.
6253086	eng	Tom said that I should quit smoking.
6253087	eng	I wasn't strong enough to do that.
6253088	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that she needs to be more careful.
6253089	eng	Tom said that I should do that soon.
6253090	eng	I wasn't interested in doing that.
6253091	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he wants her to help John do that.
6253092	eng	Tom said that I had to speak French.
6253093	eng	I was told not to do that anymore.
6253094	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who she should invite to the party.
6253095	eng	Tom said it's not going to end well.
6253096	eng	I was planning to go to Australia.
6253097	eng	Tom said that was the first time he'd ever seen Mary doing that.
6253098	eng	Tom said it's a very common problem.
6253099	eng	I was just getting ready to leave.
6253100	eng	Tom said that the doctor told him Mary wasn't likely to recover.
6253101	eng	Tom said it wasn't likely to happen.
6253102	eng	I was born the same day as my dog.
6253103	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who felt like doing that.
6253104	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who did that.
6253105	eng	I was afraid to do that by myself.
6253106	eng	Tom said he would've done that if he'd known Mary wanted him to.
6253107	eng	Tom said it was time for reflection.
6253108	eng	I wanted to go to business school.
6253109	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't suggested to Mary that she do that.
6253110	eng	Tom said his team will probably win.
6253111	eng	I wanted to go to Boston with you.
6253112	eng	Tom said he was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that or not.
6253113	eng	Tom said his son wasn't a terrorist.
6253114	eng	I want to speak to you right away.
6253115	eng	Tom said he was wondering whether Mary needed to do that or not.
6253116	eng	Tom said his son was a good athlete.
6253117	eng	I want to see you ride a unicycle.
6253118	eng	Tom said he thought it wasn't the first time Mary had done that.
6253119	eng	Tom said his parents have done that.
6253120	eng	I want to see what's in that room.
6253121	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the only one who wanted to do that.
6253122	eng	Tom said his new car cost him a lot.
6253123	eng	I want to learn to sing in French.
6253124	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the only one who needed to do that.
6253125	eng	Tom said he's willing to be patient.
6253126	eng	I want to learn some French songs.
6253127	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be allowed to do that by herself.
6253128	eng	Tom said he's trying to lose weight.
6253129	eng	I want to know where you did that.
6253130	eng	Tom said he thought Mary could afford to buy the car she wanted.
6253131	eng	Tom said he's proud of his children.
6253132	eng	I want to know when you're coming.
6253133	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be permitted to do that at home.
6253134	eng	Tom said he's never eaten Thai food.
6253135	eng	I want to know how much I owe you.
6253136	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really did that without any help.
6253137	eng	Tom said he's glad you weren't hurt.
6253138	eng	I want to keep things as they are.
6253139	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really had to attend that meeting.
6253140	eng	Tom said he's glad he could do that.
6253141	eng	I want to get my driver's license.
6253142	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really did what John said she did.
6253143	eng	Tom said he's done that three times.
6253144	eng	I want to do everything by myself.
6253145	eng	Tom said he didn't know what Mary's reasons for doing that were.
6253146	eng	Tom said he's determined to do that.
6253147	eng	I want to come to Boston with you.
6253148	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be the one who has to do that.
6253149	eng	Tom said he's cautiously optimistic.
6253150	eng	I want to come back here tomorrow.
6253151	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be present at the meeting on Monday.
6253152	eng	Tom said he's been told not do that.
6253153	eng	I want to ask you a few questions.
6253154	eng	Tom said Mary thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
6253155	eng	Tom said he's been to Boston before.
6253156	eng	I usually do that during my break.
6253157	eng	Tom said Mary thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
6253158	eng	Tom said he's been asked to do that.
6253159	eng	I used to go to a lot of concerts.
6253160	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be allowed to do that by himself.
6253161	eng	Tom said he'll take what he can get.
6253162	eng	I used to be a pretty good dancer.
6253163	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that by himself.
6253164	eng	Tom said he'd very unlikely do that.
6253165	eng	I tried to see if I could do that.
6253166	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not need to do that by himself.
6253167	eng	Tom said he'd still like to do that.
6253168	eng	I tried to keep my voice calm.
6253169	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not have to do that by himself.
6253170	eng	Tom said he'd never want to do that.
6253171	eng	I thought you knew how to do that.
6253172	eng	Tom said Mary needed at least $300 to buy everything she needed.
6253173	eng	Tom said he'd be tempted to do that.
6253174	eng	I thought you did that quite well.
6253175	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be required to do that anymore.
6253176	eng	Tom said he writes his own speeches.
6253177	eng	I thought I wouldn't be gone long.
6253178	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be permitted to do that by herself.
6253179	eng	Tom said he won't forget that night.
6253180	eng	I thought I must be seeing things.
6253181	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that this evening.
6253182	eng	Tom said he wished he could do that.
6253183	eng	I thought I might need to do that.
6253184	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be permitted to do that again.
6253185	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to help us.
6253186	eng	I thought I might have to do that.
6253187	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be required to do that by himself.
6253188	eng	Tom said he was too weak to do that.
6253189	eng	I think you're a relative of mine.
6253190	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him to help her.
6253191	eng	Tom said he was too lazy to do that.
6253192	eng	I think we'll be able to help you.
6253193	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is good at French or not.
6253194	eng	Tom said he was too busy to do that.
6253195	eng	I think we should reconsider that.
6253196	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary wasn't the one who did that.
6253197	eng	Tom said he was tired of doing that.
6253198	eng	I think it'll possible to do that.
6253199	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary doesn't know how to do that.
6253200	eng	Tom said he was hoping we'd do that.
6253201	eng	I think doing that will be tiring.
6253202	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he told her he didn't know how to do that.
6253203	eng	Tom said he was grateful to be here.
6253204	eng	I think doing that is a good idea.
6253205	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John wants her to do.
6253206	eng	Tom said he wants to sell his house.
6253207	eng	I think I'm a pretty good drummer.
6253208	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John tells her to do.
6253209	eng	Tom said he wants to clear his name.
6253210	eng	I think I'd like to do that again.
6253211	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John wants her to do.
6253212	eng	Tom said he wanted to join our band.
6253213	eng	I think I'd be nervous doing that.
6253214	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John tells her to do.
6253215	eng	Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
6253216	eng	I think I was supposed to do that.
6253217	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be ready to do that until next year.
6253218	eng	Tom said he wanted to do that again.
6253219	eng	I think I could do the same thing.
6253220	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be glad that that's going to happen.
6253221	eng	Tom said he wanted a second opinion.
6253222	eng	I still haven't weeded the garden.
6253223	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be able to convince John to do that.
6253224	eng	Tom said he understands our concern.
6253225	eng	I still haven't washed my clothes.
6253226	eng	Tom doesn't need to tell Mary how to do that. She already knows.
6253227	eng	Tom said he thought I looked lonely.
6253228	eng	I still haven't paid all my bills.
6253229	eng	Tom doesn't have to tell Mary how to do that. She already knows.
6253230	eng	Tom said he thought I looked hungry.
6253231	eng	I still haven't found my passport.
6253232	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to know that he didn't know how to do that.
6253233	eng	Tom said he prefers to stay at home.
6253234	eng	I shouldn't have reacted that way.
6253235	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be able to convince John to do that.
6253236	eng	Tom said he never wanted to do that.
6253237	eng	I shouldn't have been there today.
6253238	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
6253239	eng	Tom said he needs to get more sleep.
6253240	eng	I should've put on more sunscreen.
6253241	eng	Tom didn't know what to do with all the junk Mary had given him.
6253242	eng	Tom said he loves that kind of work.
6253243	eng	I should've locked all my windows.
6253244	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't supposed to do that by herself.
6253245	eng	Tom said he likes this time of year.
6253246	eng	I should've let you do that first.
6253247	eng	Tom and Mary decided they'd go on a picnic in spite of the rain.
6253248	eng	Tom said he likes the sound of that.
6253249	eng	I should've hired a better lawyer.
6253250	eng	I'm sure Tom will be glad when he hears Mary is coming to visit.
6253251	eng	Tom said he keeps a gun in his home.
6253252	eng	I should've driven more carefully.
6253253	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me where Mary had gone to college.
6253254	eng	Tom said he isn't likely to do that.
6253255	eng	I should've done that last summer.
6253256	eng	I didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary what she had to do.
6253257	eng	Tom said he heard three shots fired.
6253258	eng	I should've closed all my windows.
6253259	eng	You know that Tom can't do that as well as Mary can, don't you?
6253260	eng	Tom said he heard a lot of gunshots.
6253261	eng	I should've chosen something else.
6253262	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't ask Mary not to do that, didn't you?
6253263	eng	Tom said he had no plans to do that.
6253264	eng	I should've apologized right away.
6253265	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary to ask John to do that, didn't you?
6253266	eng	Tom said he had a few things to say.
6253267	eng	I should be the one who does that.
6253268	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary that he doesn't know how to do that.
6253269	eng	Tom said he figured I could do that.
6253270	eng	I should be in Boston next Monday.
6253271	eng	Tom won't likely forget to tell Mary he needs her to help John.
6253272	eng	Tom said he felt tempted to do that.
6253273	eng	I really should've gone to Boston.
6253274	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to forget to water the flowers.
6253275	eng	Tom said he felt good about his win.
6253276	por	Nós sempre amamos aqueles que nos admiram, mas nem sempre amamos aqueles que admiramos.
6253277	eng	I realize I don't have to do that.
6253279	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that.
6253280	eng	I quietly slipped out of the room.
6253281	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be more careful in the future.
6253282	eng	Tom said he doesn't mind doing that.
6253283	eng	I put on my coat and went outside.
6253284	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was the last one to do that.
6253285	eng	Tom said he doesn't know what to do.
6253286	eng	I promise I won't do that anymore.
6253287	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had been tempted to do that.
6253288	eng	Tom said he doesn't do that anymore.
6253289	eng	I probably wouldn't do that again.
6253290	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John finished doing that by 2:30.
6253291	eng	Tom said he didn't want to worry me.
6253292	eng	I plan to go to Boston next month.
6253293	eng	Tom thinks that if he hadn't done that, Mary wouldn't be angry.
6253294	eng	Tom said he didn't want to watch TV.
6253295	eng	I often go there in the afternoon.
6253296	eng	Tom thinks Mary has to do that, but she doesn't really have to.
6253297	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to worry.
6253298	eng	I never expected to do that again.
6253299	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't have to do that today.
6253300	eng	Tom said he didn't know where to go.
6253301	eng	I need to buy a new pair of shoes.
6253302	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary that he knows how to do that.
6253303	eng	Tom said he didn't feel like a hero.
6253304	eng	I must do that before I go to bed.
6253305	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he doesn't intend to do that.
6253306	eng	Tom said he didn't enjoy doing that.
6253307	eng	I might visit Boston next October.
6253308	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really wants to do that today.
6253309	eng	Tom said he didn't eat meat anymore.
6253310	eng	I love the way you make spaghetti.
6253311	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really wants to do that again.
6253312	eng	Tom said essentially the same thing.
6253313	eng	I looked at the clock on the wall.
6253314	eng	Tom said that he thinks Mary won't want to go swimming with us.
6253315	eng	Tom said doing that wasn't much fun.
6253316	eng	I know you didn't want to do that.
6253317	eng	Tom said that Mary has been wanting to do that for a long time.
6253318	eng	Tom said doing that was frustrating.
6253319	eng	I know exactly what I ought to do.
6253320	eng	Tom said it was Mary who told him he had to do that by himself.
6253321	eng	Tom said doing that isn't an option.
6253322	eng	I know exactly what I need to buy.
6253323	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to convince Mary to do that.
6253324	eng	Tom said all that didn't bother him.
6253325	eng	I know exactly what I have to buy.
6253326	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary to tell John to do that.
6253327	eng	Tom said a woman answered the phone.
6253328	eng	I know everyone is waiting for me.
6253329	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that again.
6253330	eng	Tom said I shouldn't have done that.
6253331	eng	I know I'm not likely to be fired.
6253332	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be required to do that anymore.
6253333	eng	Tom said I should get more exercise.
6253334	eng	I know I shouldn't have said that.
6253335	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be permitted to do that by herself.
6253336	eng	Tom said I needed to get more sleep.
6253337	eng	I know I should've gone to Boston.
6253338	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that anymore.
6253339	eng	Tom said I looked like I was asleep.
6253340	eng	I know I should be doing that now.
6253341	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needs to do that anymore.
6253342	eng	Tom retired from basketball in 2013.
6253343	eng	I knew what you were going to say.
6253344	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really had to do that by herself.
6253345	eng	Tom refuses to work the night shift.
6253346	eng	I knew I didn't have enough money.
6253347	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary had studied French for very long.
6253348	eng	Tom refused to work the night shift.
6253349	eng	I kept on making the same mistake.
6253350	eng	Tom said Mary would be able to do that, but she wasn't able to.
6253351	eng	Tom recommended that we not do that.
6253352	eng	I keep on making the same mistake.
6253353	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be quicker at doing that than John.
6253354	eng	Tom received a thirty-year sentence.
6253355	eng	I just moved to Boston last month.
6253356	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not need to do that by herself.
6253357	eng	Tom really pays attention to people.
6253358	eng	I just did that a few seconds ago.
6253359	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not have to do that by herself.
6253360	eng	Tom really likes Chinese food a lot.
6253361	eng	I just did that a few minutes ago.
6253362	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might have to do that this afternoon.
6253363	eng	Tom really enjoys playing the drums.
6253364	eng	I intend to do that tomorrow, too.
6253365	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be required to do that in October.
6253366	eng	Tom really encouraged me to do that.
6253367	eng	I hope to be back by October 20th.
6253368	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be required to do that by herself.
6253369	eng	Tom really doesn't have much choice.
6253370	eng	I help my mother with the cooking.
6253371	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might need to do that several more times.
6253372	eng	Tom rarely goes to places like that.
6253373	eng	I heard that you couldn't do that.
6253374	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might have to do that several more times.
6253375	eng	Tom put out the fire with a blanket.
6253376	eng	I haven't taken a bath for a week.
6253377	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might be permitted to do that by himself.
6253378	eng	Tom put his cup down on the counter.
6253379	eng	I haven't regretted that decision.
6253380	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
6253381	eng	Tom promised to come, but he didn't.
6253382	eng	I haven't done that since October.
6253383	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be allowed to do that by himself.
6253384	eng	Tom promised not to do that anymore.
6253385	eng	I have to speak French for my job.
6253386	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she should do that.
6253387	eng	Tom promised he'll do that tomorrow.
6253388	eng	I have some experience doing that.
6253389	eng	Tom probably knew before we did that Mary was going to do that.
6253390	eng	Tom promised he won't do that today.
6253391	eng	I have no objection to doing that.
6253392	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him to do that.
6253393	eng	Tom promised he won't do that again.
6253394	eng	I hadn't intended to stay so long.
6253395	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary didn't come to school today.
6253396	eng	Tom probably won't be here tomorrow.
6253397	eng	I had no idea I was being lied to.
6253398	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary wants to do that or not.
6253399	eng	Tom probably won't agree to do that.
6253400	eng	I had a feeling you might do that.
6253401	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary needs to do that or not.
6253402	eng	Tom probably was correct about that.
6253403	eng	I feel that I've done that before.
6253404	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is good at chess or not.
6253405	eng	Tom probably hasn't gotten home yet.
6253406	eng	I doubt there's a market for that.
6253407	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary can speak French or not.
6253408	eng	Tom probably doesn't know the rules.
6253409	eng	I don't yet know what I should do.
6253410	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary isn't the one who did that.
6253411	eng	Tom probably didn't want to do that.
6253412	eng	I don't work as much as I used to.
6253413	eng	Tom noticed that Mary's car was parked in front of the library.
6253414	eng	Tom probably didn't study yesterday.
6253415	eng	I don't want you to do what I did.
6253416	eng	Tom knows he'll never be able to play the harp as well as Mary.
6253417	eng	Tom probably couldn't do that alone.
6253418	eng	I don't want you to do that today.
6253419	eng	Tom is supposed to be helping Mary with her homework right now.
6253420	eng	Tom postponed his trip to Australia.
6253421	eng	I don't want you to do that alone.
6253422	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John asks her to do.
6253423	eng	Tom plays violin exceptionally well.
6253424	eng	I don't want you to do that again.
6253425	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John wants her to do.
6253426	eng	Tom plans to go to Boston next year.
6253427	eng	I don't want to work in a factory.
6253428	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John tells her to do.
6253429	eng	Tom passed away yesterday afternoon.
6253430	eng	I don't want to talk about sports.
6253431	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do what John thinks she should do.
6253432	eng	Tom painted until his death in 2013.
6253433	eng	I don't want to stay home all day.
6253434	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do everything John asks her to do.
6253435	eng	Tom owes his success to his parents.
6253436	eng	I don't want to play golf anymore.
6253437	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is the kind of person who would do that.
6253438	eng	Tom only does what he's asked to do.
6253439	eng	I don't want to hang out with you.
6253440	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary was supposed to do that.
6253441	eng	Tom often helps me with my homework.
6253442	eng	I don't want to get married again.
6253443	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him he had to do that.
6253444	eng	Tom often falls asleep during class.
6253445	eng	I don't want to do that on my own.
6253446	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary used to be pretty good at doing that.
6253447	eng	Tom often complains about the noise.
6253448	eng	I don't want to do that every day.
6253449	eng	Tom didn't know Mary spoke French almost like a native speaker.
6253450	eng	Tom often complained about the cold.
6253451	eng	I don't want to do anything today.
6253452	eng	Tom and Mary don't play music together as much as they used to.
6253453	eng	Tom never said he wanted to do that.
6253454	eng	I don't want to be like my father.
6253455	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary well enough to know what she'll do.
6253456	eng	Tom never really enjoyed doing that.
6253457	eng	I don't want to be doing that now.
6253458	eng	I wish that Tom hadn't overheard Mary and me talking about him.
6253460	eng	I don't want to attract attention.
6253461	eng	All three of us thought Tom was the one who stole Mary's purse.
6253462	eng	Tom never expected to do that again.
6253464	eng	You knew Tom told Mary to ask John not to do that, didn't you?
6253465	eng	Tom never complained about the heat.
6253466	eng	I don't want that to happen again.
6253467	eng	You knew Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that, didn't you?
6253468	eng	Tom never complained about the cold.
6253469	eng	I don't want anyone to talk to me.
6253470	eng	Tom won't likely forget to tell Mary he won't be at her party.
6253471	eng	Tom needs to find someplace to live.
6253472	eng	I don't think you have to do that.
6253473	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that she needs to be more careful.
6253474	eng	Tom must've wanted to leave earlier.
6253475	eng	I don't think that'll ever happen.
6253476	eng	Tom wants Mary to know that he really doesn't want to do that.
6253477	eng	Tom must've been tempted to do that.
6253478	eng	I don't think that we can do that.
6253479	eng	Tom wanted Mary to know that he really didn't want to do that.
6253480	eng	Tom must've been fascinated by that.
6253481	eng	I don't think I'm going to resign.
6253482	eng	Tom thought Mary wouldn't be able to convince John to do that.
6253483	eng	Tom must've been awake at that time.
6253484	eng	I don't think I'll get in trouble.
6253485	eng	Tom thought Mary would be amused when she heard what John did.
6253486	eng	Tom moved here less than a year ago.
6253487	eng	I don't think I needed to do that.
6253488	eng	Tom thinks that if he had done that, Mary would've been upset.
6253489	eng	Tom might study French this evening.
6253490	eng	I don't think I can do that today.
6253491	eng	Tom thinks Mary can probably convince John to stop doing that.
6253492	eng	Tom might get fired if he does that.
6253493	eng	I don't think I can be happy here.
6253494	eng	Tom spent a lot of time talking with Mary yesterday afternoon.
6253495	eng	Tom may do that wherever he chooses.
6253496	eng	I don't take vacations very often.
6253497	eng	Tom should've asked Mary where she wanted him to park the car.
6253498	eng	Tom may do that anywhere he chooses.
6253499	eng	I don't swim as well as I used to.
6253500	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary why she shouldn't be doing that.
6253501	eng	Tom may come with us if he wants to.
6253502	eng	I don't remember who told me that.
6253503	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
6253504	eng	Tom managed to escape from his cell.
6253505	eng	I don't remember where I did that.
6253506	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she wanted to do that.
6253507	eng	Tom made up his mind to be a doctor.
6253508	eng	I don't remember my doctor's name.
6253509	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she needed to do that.
6253510	eng	Tom made up his mind not to do that.
6253511	eng	I don't remember having said that.
6253512	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows she has to do that before Monday.
6253513	eng	Tom made me wait for thirty minutes.
6253514	eng	I don't remember having done that.
6253515	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary would really want to do that.
6253516	eng	Tom made a lot of spelling mistakes.
6253517	eng	I don't really feel like swimming.
6253518	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would have to do that on her own.
6253519	eng	Tom lost his wife in a car accident.
6253520	eng	I don't really feel like studying.
6253521	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would have to do that by herself.
6253522	eng	Tom looked at me as if I were crazy.
6253523	eng	I don't play golf so much anymore.
6253524	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would eventually want to do that.
6253525	eng	Tom lives with his father in Boston.
6253526	eng	I don't need to worry about money.
6253527	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who enjoyed doing that.
6253528	eng	Tom lives with his family in Boston.
6253529	eng	I don't need to go back to Boston.
6253530	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that wouldn't be interesting.
6253531	eng	Tom lives in Boston with his mother.
6253532	eng	I don't need to do that right now.
6253533	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't think doing that would be dangerous.
6253534	eng	Tom lives in Boston with his family.
6253535	eng	I don't need to do that every day.
6253536	eng	Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't go out after dark by herself.
6253537	eng	Tom lived in Boston until last year.
6253538	eng	I don't need to do that by myself.
6253539	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not want to do that by herself.
6253540	eng	Tom likes taking care of the garden.
6253541	eng	I don't mind if you don't do that.
6253542	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that by herself.
6253543	eng	Tom likes barbecuing for his family.
6253544	eng	I don't live in this neighborhood.
6253545	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that by herself.
6253546	eng	Tom let me know that he had arrived.
6253547	eng	I don't like you very much either.
6253548	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that this afternoon.
6253550	eng	I don't like to read on the train.
6253551	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be allowed to do that at home.
6253552	eng	Tom lent us money when we needed it.
6253553	eng	I don't like the way you did that.
6253554	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be required to do that by herself.
6253555	eng	Tom left for Boston three hours ago.
6253556	eng	I don't like talking to strangers.
6253557	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary knows how to do that very well.
6253558	eng	Tom left for Australia this morning.
6253559	eng	I don't like talking about sports.
6253560	eng	Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary was feeling sick.
6253561	eng	Tom leaves for Australia next month.
6253562	eng	I don't like driving on icy roads.
6253563	eng	Tom said Mary would need at least $300 to buy what she needed.
6253564	eng	Tom knows why he's getting a chance.
6253565	eng	I don't leave my house after dark.
6253566	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be interested in doing that.
6253567	eng	Tom knows what he's doing out there.
6253568	eng	I don't know why I should do that.
6253569	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be retired by this time next year.
6253570	eng	Tom knows this is a tough situation.
6253571	eng	I don't know why I had to do that.
6253572	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be faster at doing that than John.
6253573	eng	Tom knows that I've never done that.
6253574	eng	I don't know who those people are.
6253575	eng	Tom said Mary thought she was the only one who had to do that.
6253576	eng	Tom knows that I did that yesterday.
6253577	eng	I don't know where my umbrella is.
6253578	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be permitted to do that today.
6253579	eng	Tom knows he's got to do that today.
6253580	eng	I don't know what'll happen to me.
6253581	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not want to do that by himself.
6253582	eng	Tom knows he's going to be punished.
6253583	eng	I don't know what the solution is.
6253584	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not need to do that by himself.
6253585	eng	Tom knows he's going to be arrested.
6253586	eng	I don't know what I should do yet.
6253587	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
6253588	eng	Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
6253589	eng	I don't know much about gardening.
6253590	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might need to do that this evening.
6253591	eng	Tom knows exactly what he should do.
6253592	eng	I don't know how to tie a bowline.
6253593	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might have to do that this evening.
6253594	eng	Tom knows exactly what he has to do.
6253595	eng	I don't know how deep the pool is.
6253596	eng	Tom said Mary probably wouldn't be able to do that by herself.
6253597	eng	Tom knows I was supposed to do that.
6253598	eng	I don't know how I should do that.
6253599	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that by herself.
6253600	eng	Tom knew he was supposed to do that.
6253601	eng	I don't know anything about opera.
6253602	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that until October.
6253603	eng	Tom killed himself three nights ago.
6253604	eng	I don't have very much experience.
6253605	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be permitted to do that today.
6253606	eng	Tom just does what he's asked to do.
6253607	eng	I don't have to worry about money.
6253608	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might be required to do that by himself.
6253609	eng	Tom just did that a few minutes ago.
6253610	eng	I don't have to help anyone today.
6253611	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be allowed to do that again.
6253612	eng	Tom jumped his horse over the fence.
6253613	eng	I don't have to go back to Boston.
6253614	eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John wants to do that or not.
6253615	eng	Tom isn't the only one who's sleepy.
6253616	eng	I don't have to go anywhere today.
6253617	eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John needs to do that or not.
6253618	eng	Tom isn't the one I'm worried about.
6253619	eng	I don't have to finish this today.
6253620	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6253621	eng	Tom isn't so old that he can't work.
6253622	eng	I don't have to do this every day.
6253623	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want me to do that.
6253624	eng	Tom isn't much fun to hang out with.
6253625	eng	I don't have to do that right now.
6253626	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary didn't want him to do that.
6253627	eng	Tom isn't likely to be thirsty.
6253628	eng	I don't have to do that every day.
6253629	eng	Tom laughed so loud that Mary could hear him from the kitchen.
6253630	eng	Tom isn't likely to be pleased.
6253631	eng	I don't have to do that by myself.
6253632	eng	Tom knew it probably wasn't the first time Mary had done that.
6253633	eng	Tom isn't likely to be outside.
6253634	eng	I don't have the skill to do that.
6253635	eng	Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do what Mary wanted him to do.
6253636	eng	Tom isn't likely to be on time.
6253637	eng	I don't have the means to do that.
6253638	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she needs to do what John asks her to do.
6253639	eng	Tom isn't likely to be nervous.
6253640	eng	I don't have a fever this morning.
6253641	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do whatever John tells her to do.
6253642	eng	Tom isn't likely to be jealous.
6253643	eng	I don't have a case for my guitar.
6253644	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do what John is asking her to do.
6253645	eng	Tom isn't going to camp this summer.
6253646	eng	I don't give Mary flowers anymore.
6253647	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do what John has asked her to do.
6253648	eng	Tom isn't as young as he says he is.
6253649	eng	I don't get up as early as you do.
6253650	eng	Tom has been trying to convince Mary to start studying French.
6253651	eng	Tom isn't as busy as the rest of us.
6253652	eng	I don't get paid a lot to do that.
6253653	eng	Tom has been hoping he can go to Boston with Mary next summer.
6253654	eng	Tom isn't anything like his brother.
6253655	eng	I don't feel motivated to do that.
6253656	eng	Tom has already told Mary that he doesn't know how to do that.
6253657	eng	Tom isn't allowed to do that either.
6253658	eng	I don't ever want to leave Boston.
6253659	eng	Tom has already told Mary she needs to be there tomorrow at 2:30.
6253660	eng	Tom isn't afraid to do that anymore.
6253661	eng	I don't do that as well as you do.
6253662	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was interested in learning how to drive.
6253663	eng	Tom isn't afraid of people like you.
6253664	eng	I don't come to Boston very often.
6253665	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary didn't want to do that.
6253666	eng	Tom isn't a teacher. He's a student.
6253667	eng	I don't care whether we go or not.
6253668	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary was supposed to do that.
6253669	eng	Tom is waiting for you on the porch.
6253670	eng	I don't care that my car is dirty.
6253671	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him where Mary had gone.
6253672	eng	Tom is visiting his uncle in Boston.
6253673	eng	I don't care one way or the other.
6253674	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him Mary had to do that.
6253675	eng	Tom is very generous with his money.
6253676	eng	I do that every day for my health.
6253677	eng	Tom denied that Mary was the one who persuaded him to do that.
6253678	eng	Tom is very active in his community.
6253679	eng	I didn't want to take that chance.
6253680	eng	Tom denied that Mary was the one who convinced him to do that.
6253681	eng	Tom is trying not to get in trouble.
6253682	eng	I didn't want to take any chances.
6253683	eng	Tom couldn't do that by himself, so he asked Mary to help him.
6253684	eng	Tom is too old to run for president.
6253685	eng	I didn't want to go anywhere else.
6253686	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John was supposed to be there.
6253687	eng	Tom is too exhausted to do that now.
6253688	eng	I didn't want to get into trouble.
6253689	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting on the grass, talking to each other.
6253690	eng	Tom is too delirious to do that now.
6253691	eng	I didn't want to do that that way.
6253692	eng	Tom and Mary must've been tired when they got home last night.
6253693	eng	Tom is thinking about what happened.
6253694	eng	I didn't want anyone else to know.
6253695	eng	Tom and I stayed behind to help Mary clean up after her party.
6253696	eng	Tom is the son of a race car driver.
6253697	eng	I didn't think you were in Boston.
6253698	eng	Tom and I did our best to help Mary do what needed to be done.
6253699	eng	Tom is the owner of this restaurant.
6253700	eng	I didn't think you should do that.
6253701	eng	Tom and I couldn't agree on what to buy Mary for her birthday.
6253702	eng	Tom is the only person who did that.
6253703	eng	I didn't think I would be nervous.
6253704	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to help Mary do that.
6253705	eng	Tom is the one who's lagging behind.
6253706	eng	I didn't think I would be jealous.
6253707	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't like Mary.
6253708	eng	Tom is the one who knows what to do.
6253709	eng	I didn't tell you the whole truth.
6253710	eng	I thought there was a good chance that Tom wouldn't know Mary.
6253711	eng	Tom is the one who knows the answer.
6253712	eng	I didn't take my umbrella with me.
6253713	eng	I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
6253714	eng	Tom is the oldest of three children.
6253715	eng	I didn't take an umbrella with me.
6253716	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary what to do.
6253717	eng	Tom is the nicest kid I've ever met.
6253718	eng	I didn't stay in Boston very long.
6253719	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
6253720	eng	Tom is the most qualified candidate.
6253721	eng	I didn't say where I wanted to go.
6253722	eng	I don't know where Tom and Mary are going for their honeymoon.
6253723	eng	Tom is the grandson of a coal miner.
6253724	eng	I didn't say I'd do that, did I?
6253725	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other?
6253726	eng	Tom is the best player on this team.
6253727	eng	I didn't realize what I had to do.
6253728	eng	Did you know Tom used to work at the same place Mary does now?
6253729	eng	Tom is the best chess player I know.
6253730	eng	I didn't realize I should do that.
6253731	eng	You knew Tom was unlikely to ask Mary to do that, didn't you?
6253732	eng	Tom is the best banjo player I know.
6253733	eng	I didn't realize I had to do that.
6253734	eng	You didn't know why Tom didn't want Mary to do that, did you?
6253735	eng	Tom is the author of numerous books.
6253736	eng	I didn't live in Boston last year.
6253737	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't wearing black at John's funeral.
6253738	eng	Tom is sure to be cut from the team.
6253739	eng	I didn't know you used to do that.
6253740	eng	Tom was sure Mary didn't know she wasn't supposed to do that.
6253741	eng	Tom is studying to become a teacher.
6253742	eng	I didn't know which one to choose.
6253743	eng	Tom wanted to stay longer, but Mary said they had to go home.
6253744	eng	Tom is struggling to make ends meet.
6253745	eng	I didn't know what was in the box.
6253747	eng	Tom is still working as a bartender.
6253748	eng	I didn't know what was being said.
6253749	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't think Mary will agree to do that.
6253750	eng	Tom is still unpacking his suitcase.
6253751	eng	I didn't know what should be done.
6253752	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be more careful from now on.
6253753	eng	Tom is still considering doing that.
6253754	eng	I didn't know what I needed to do.
6253755	eng	Tom told Mary that he was quicker at doing that than she was.
6253756	eng	Tom is recovering from neck surgery.
6253757	eng	I didn't know that you'd be there.
6253758	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was determined to do that.
6253759	eng	Tom is probably not having much fun.
6253760	eng	I didn't know I shouldn't do that.
6253761	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was engaged to Alice.
6253762	eng	Tom is pretty good at fixing things.
6253763	eng	I didn't know I needed to do that.
6253764	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted to quit his job and find another one.
6253765	eng	Tom is only trying to get attention.
6253766	eng	I didn't know I needed more money.
6253767	eng	Tom thinks that Mary doesn't know that John can speak French.
6253768	eng	Tom is only doing what he has to do.
6253769	eng	I didn't intend to break the vase.
6253770	eng	Tom should've been home at the time he told Mary he would be.
6253771	eng	Tom is one person I'll never forget.
6253772	eng	I didn't hear everything you said.
6253773	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she should make herself a sandwich.
6253774	eng	Tom is on his way back to Australia.
6253775	eng	I didn't have to worry about that.
6253776	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary why he doesn't want to do that.
6253777	eng	Tom is old enough to know the truth.
6253778	eng	I didn't have to work last Monday.
6253779	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary wasn't supposed to do that.
6253780	eng	Tom is more famous than his brother.
6253781	eng	I didn't have to pay for anything.

6253790	eng	I didn't have everything I needed.
6253791	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who she should ask to the party.

6253795	eng	Tom is lucky he didn't get arrested.
6253796	eng	I didn't have anyone to play with.
6253797	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would ever be able to do that.
6253798	eng	Tom is looking for a second opinion.
6253799	eng	I didn't have any other questions.
6253800	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary can stop John from doing that.
6253801	eng	Tom is likely to still be skeptical.
6253802	eng	I didn't have any help doing that.
6253803	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would have to do that next week.

6253815	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who needed to do that.
6253816	eng	Tom is likely to be able to do that.
6253817	eng	I didn't enjoy the play very much.
6253818	eng	Tom said that Mary doesn't think you can do that by yourself.
6253819	eng	Tom is like a kid himself sometimes.
6253820	eng	I didn't do what I should've done.
6253821	eng	Tom said that Mary doesn't think John can do that by himself.

6253837	eng	Tom is going out to buy some things.
6253838	eng	I didn't buy what I needed to buy.
6253839	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that on her own.
6253840	eng	Tom is getting to be such a big boy.
6253841	eng	I didn't answer all the questions.
6253842	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be able to do that by herself.

6253954	eng	Tom is a good person to have around.
6253955	eng	How did you know I didn't do that?

6253969	eng	Tom is a doctor and also a novelist.
6253970	eng	Even if you don't do that, I will.
6253971	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
6253972	eng	Tom is a coward and always has been.
6253973	eng	Don't you want to do that with me?

6253975	eng	Tom is a Canadian basketball player.
6253976	eng	Don't you try to blame this on me.

6253978	eng	Tom immediately began playing again.
6253979	eng	Don't you feel safe in your house?
6253980	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary wanted him to do that.
6253981	eng	Tom hurt his left foot when he fell.

6253990	eng	Tom hid himself behind a large rock.
6253991	eng	Don't forget to close the windows.

6253996	eng	Tom helps me out by singing harmony.
6253997	eng	Don't do that until I tell you to.
6253998	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him what Mary had done.
6253999	eng	Tom hasn't told us what he might do.
6254000	eng	Doing that wouldn't make me happy.
6254001	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary wouldn't do what he asked her to do.
6254002	eng	Tom hasn't said what he plans to do.
6254003	eng	Doing that would probably be safe.
6254004	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary would be able to do that or not.
6254005	eng	Tom hasn't responded to our request.
6254006	eng	Doing that would be very romantic.
6254007	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was going for her summer vacation.
6254008	eng	Tom hasn't been arrested or charged.
6254009	eng	Doing that would be very reckless.
6254010	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was supposed to do that by herself.
6254011	eng	Tom has worked hard for his success.
6254012	eng	Doing that would be really stupid.
6254013	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary had intended to be there yesterday.
6254014	eng	Tom has what seems like a good idea.
6254015	eng	Doing that would be a big mistake.
6254016	eng	Tom didn't know that I was the one who Mary chose to do that.
6254017	eng	Tom has twice as much money as I do.
6254018	eng	Doing that won't be very much fun.
6254019	eng	Tom asked Mary why she needed to stay in Boston until Monday.
6254020	eng	Tom has told me not to do that here.
6254021	eng	Doing that will be very dangerous.
6254022	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
6254023	eng	Tom has told me he wants to do that.
6254024	eng	Doing that probably won't be safe.
6254025	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't want to go to Boston with John.
6254026	eng	Tom has told me he needs to do that.
6254027	eng	Doing that must be boring for you.
6254028	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach him how to say "thank you" in French.
6254029	eng	Tom has told me I shouldn't do that.
6254030	eng	Doing that is likely to be tiring.
6254031	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what hotel John wanted to stay at.
6254032	eng	Tom has to take care of some things.
6254033	eng	Doing that is likely to be boring.
6254034	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew the name of John's favorite movie.
6254035	eng	Tom has to find some way to do that.
6254036	eng	Doing that is bad for your health.
6254037	eng	Tom and Mary don't hang out together as much as they used to.
6254038	eng	Tom has to be the one who does that.
6254039	eng	Doing that cost me a lot of money.
6254040	eng	Tom and I did our best to help Mary do what she needed to do.
6254041	eng	Tom has to be in Boston next Monday.
6254042	eng	Do you want us to do that for you?
6254043	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what Mary told him he needed to do.
6254045	eng	Do you usually sleep on airplanes?
6254046	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary wasn't the one who did that.
6254047	eng	Tom has things he still needs to do.
6254048	eng	Do you usually do that on Mondays?
6254049	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't know how to do that.
6254050	eng	Tom has three sons and two daughters.
6254051	eng	Do you think you're a good driver?
6254052	eng	I didn't think Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that.
6254053	eng	Tom has said he won't do that again.
6254054	eng	Do you still feel like doing that?
6254055	eng	Does Tom still go out with Mary every Monday like he used to?
6254056	eng	Tom has proposed three alternatives.
6254057	eng	Do you still eat out every Monday?
6254058	eng	Did you know that Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
6254059	eng	Tom has promised that he'll do that.
6254060	eng	Do you still do that the same way?
6254061	eng	You knew Tom wanted Mary to ask John to do that, didn't you?
6254062	eng	Tom has probably gotten home by now.
6254063	eng	Do you still do that every Monday?
6254064	eng	Tom would've done that by himself if Mary hadn't helped him.
6254065	eng	Tom has plenty of friends in Boston.
6254066	eng	Do you remember where we did that?
6254067	eng	Tom would've done that by himself if Mary hadn't been there.
6254068	eng	Tom has only been on the job a week.
6254069	eng	Do you remember when you did that?
6254070	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
6254071	eng	Tom has never taken an acting class.
6254072	eng	Do you own any property in Boston?
6254073	eng	Tom was willing to do that, but Mary said he didn't need to.
6254074	eng	Tom has never eaten with chopsticks.
6254075	eng	Do you know whose shoes these are?
6254076	eng	Tom was willing to do that, but Mary said he didn't have to.
6254077	eng	Tom has never been good at baseball.
6254078	eng	Do you know whose bicycle this is?
6254079	eng	Tom told me that he's miserable here in Boston without Mary.
6254080	eng	Tom has more books than he can read.
6254081	eng	Do you know how to play the organ?
6254082	eng	Tom told Mary that she's the one responsible for doing that.
6254083	eng	Tom has made the same mistake twice.
6254084	eng	Do you intend to do that tomorrow?
6254085	eng	Tom told Mary that he was concerned about what might happen.
6254086	eng	Tom has made some very wise choices.
6254087	eng	Do you have time to do that today?
6254088	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought her suggestion was reasonable.
6254089	eng	Tom has lost interest in doing that.
6254090	eng	Do you ever take an afternoon nap?
6254091	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was motivated to do that.
6254092	eng	Tom has lost at least thirty pounds.
6254093	eng	Do you always do that by yourself?
6254094	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was doing that right now.
6254095	eng	Tom has lived there for three years.
6254096	eng	Do most of your friends have pets?
6254097	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was desperate to do that.
6254098	eng	Tom has left that decision up to us.
6254099	eng	Didn't you know you needed a visa?
6254100	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't know how to play the saxophone.
6254101	eng	Tom has improved a bit this morning.
6254102	eng	Didn't you know that would happen?
6254103	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be afraid to walk home alone at night.
6254104	eng	Tom has had three operations so far.
6254105	eng	Did you enjoy your stay in Boston?
6254106	eng	Tom seemed to be surprised that Mary wasn't able to do that.
6254107	eng	Tom has had a rough couple of years.
6254108	eng	Did you eat anything this morning?
6254109	eng	Tom seemed to be surprised that Mary didn't know what to do.
6254110	eng	Tom has gotten better at doing that.
6254111	eng	Could you please not do that here?
6254112	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wanted to do that.
6254113	eng	Tom has forgotten to do that before.
6254114	eng	Could I borrow a pair of scissors?
6254115	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary needed to do that.
6254116	eng	Tom has done what he promised to do.
6254117	eng	Can you play a musical instrument?
6254118	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would really want to do that.
6254119	eng	Tom has done that quite a few times.
6254120	eng	Can anyone else here speak French?
6254121	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary will ever be able to do that.
6254122	eng	Tom has done that many times before.
6254123	eng	Both of us won't be busy tomorrow.
6254124	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary can stop him from doing that.
6254125	eng	Tom has done that a number of times.
6254126	eng	Both of my brothers were arrested.
6254127	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary can find the time to do that.
6254128	eng	Tom has done that a couple of times.
6254129	eng	Boston is a good place to do that.
6254130	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really did that by herself.
6254131	eng	Tom has done a lot of stupid things.
6254132	eng	Be sure to do that sometime today.
6254133	eng	Tom says he can't believe Mary would really want to do that.
6254134	eng	Tom has definitely been here before.
6254135	eng	Are you going to do that tomorrow?
6254136	eng	Tom said that wasn't the real reason Mary wanted to do that.
6254137	eng	Tom has decided to quit doing that.
6254138	eng	Are you going to Boston next week?
6254139	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who liked doing that.
6254140	eng	Tom has been told he should do that.
6254141	eng	Are we still permitted to do that?
6254142	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who hated doing that.
6254143	eng	Tom has been told he has to do that.
6254144	eng	Are the police in Boston friendly?
6254145	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that wouldn't be dangerous.
6254146	eng	Tom has been sleeping all afternoon.
6254147	eng	Am I the only one who can do that?
6254148	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary if she wants him to help her do that.
6254149	eng	Tom has been shot twice in the head.
6254150	eng	"Whose book is this?" "It's mine."
6254151	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary about what he'd done.
6254152	eng	Tom has been rather busy these days.
6254153	eng	Your sunglasses are on dashboard.
6254154	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't forgotten to kiss Mary goodbye.
6254155	eng	Tom has been putting on some weight.
6254156	eng	Your shirt has bloodstains on it.
6254157	epo	Ni ĉiam amas tiujn, kiuj nin admiras, kaj ni ne ĉiam amas tiujn, kiujn ni admiras.
6254158	eng	Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore.
6254159	eng	Tom has been ordered not to do that.
6254160	eng	Your mother will be proud of you.
6254161	eng	Tom said he was wondering whether Mary would do that or not.
6254162	eng	Tom has been in jail more than once.
6254163	eng	Your left eye is twitching again.
6254164	eng	Tom said he was wondering whether Mary could do that or not.
6254165	eng	Tom has been here many times before.
6254166	eng	Your left arm seems to be broken.
6254167	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be sleeping when he got home.
6254168	eng	Tom has been here a year and a half.
6254169	eng	Your handwriting is hard to read.
6254170	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was in her room listening to music.
6254171	eng	Tom has been helping me quite a lot.
6254172	eng	Your father is younger than mine.
6254173	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary will ever be able to do that.
6254174	eng	Tom has been doing that every night.
6254175	eng	Your French is really quite good.
6254176	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that here.
6254177	eng	Tom has been caught cheating before.
6254178	eng	Your French is excellent, really.
6254179	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that until October.

6254181	eng	You've never done that, have you?
6254182	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary can stop him from doing that.

6254186	eng	Tom has been an outstanding manager.
6254187	eng	You've always been so kind to me.
6254188	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary knew how to cook Chinese food.
6254189	eng	Tom has been a very good role model.
6254190	eng	You're wearing a wig, aren't you?
6254191	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary could've done that by herself.
6254192	eng	Tom has been a really good customer.
6254193	eng	You're the tallest person I know.
6254194	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary didn't want him to do that.

6254196	eng	You're the smartest woman I know.
6254197	eng	Tom said Mary would've done that by herself if she could've.
6254198	eng	Tom has apologized for his comments.

6254211	eng	You're the quietest woman I know.
6254212	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.

6254214	eng	You're the only person I've told.

6254270	eng	Tom had red spots all over his body.
6254271	eng	You'd better not do that anymore.
6254272	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is a Canadian or not.
6254273	eng	Tom had no objection to our leaving.
6254274	eng	You won't do that here, will you?
6254275	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary can sing well or not.
6254276	eng	Tom had no idea what should be done.
6254277	eng	You told us you wouldn't do that.
6254278	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary can cook well or not.
6254279	eng	Tom had no chance to win that fight.
6254280	eng	You suggested that I not do that.
6254281	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is the one who did that.
6254282	eng	Tom had a crush on the girl next door.
6254283	eng	You still can't do that, can you?
6254284	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said he didn't know how to do that.
6254285	eng	Tom had an opportunity to come back.
6254286	eng	You should've refused to do that.
6254287	eng	Tom knew it wasn't likely the first time Mary had done that.
6254288	eng	Tom had an accident on his way home.
6254289	eng	You should do that before dinner.
6254290	eng	Tom isn't likely to be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6254291	eng	Tom had already left when I arrived.
6254292	eng	You should be allowed to do that.
6254293	eng	Tom hollered to Mary who was on the other side of the creek.
6254294	eng	Tom had a son who committed suicide.
6254295	eng	You seem to be afraid to do that.
6254296	eng	Tom has told Mary not to park her car in front of his house.
6254297	eng	Tom had a hard time making a living.
6254298	eng	You seem to be afraid of spiders.
6254299	eng	Tom has already told Mary she won't be permitted to do that.
6254300	eng	Tom had a cold, so he stayed in bed.
6254301	eng	You seem to be a compulsive liar.
6254302	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can convince John to stop doing that.
6254303	eng	Tom got what he deserved in the end.
6254304	eng	You often read novels, don't you?
6254305	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to know that he didn't know what to do.
6254306	eng	Tom got home three hours after that.
6254307	eng	You need to wait a little longer.
6254308	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was going to be in the afternoon.
6254309	eng	Tom got home last night around nine.
6254310	eng	You need to buy some new clothes.
6254311	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was supposed to help John do that.
6254312	eng	Tom got almost everything he wanted.
6254313	eng	You need to be strong to do that.
6254314	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary had intended to do that yesterday.
6254315	eng	Tom got almost everything he needed.
6254316	eng	You must be desperate to do that.
6254317	eng	Tom did everything he could to prevent Mary from doing that.
6254318	eng	Tom gets up late on Sunday mornings.
6254319	eng	You may need to do that tomorrow.
6254320	eng	Tom claims he didn't know that Mary was planning to do that.
6254321	eng	Tom generally does that around 2:30.
6254322	eng	You may eat wherever you want to.
6254323	eng	Tom and Mary are the ones who are supposed to be doing that.
6254324	eng	Tom gave us money when we needed it.
6254325	eng	You may eat whenever you want to.
6254326	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary isn't the one who did that.
6254327	eng	Tom gave no reason for his decision.
6254328	eng	You may eat whatever you want to.
6254329	eng	I don't think Tom will be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6254330	eng	Tom found several T-shirts he liked.
6254331	eng	You may do that if you'd like to.
6254332	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was planning to go to Boston with Mary?
6254333	eng	Tom found a job with a good company.
6254334	eng	You may do that here if you want.
6254335	eng	Didn't you know Tom was hoping to go to the dance with Mary?
6254336	eng	Tom forged his boss's signature.
6254337	eng	You may do that any way you like.
6254338	eng	Did you know that Tom and Mary were planning to get married?
6254339	eng	Tom first went to Australia in 2013.
6254340	eng	You may as well do that tomorrow.
6254341	eng	You knew that Tom wouldn't ask Mary to do that, didn't you?
6254342	eng	Tom finally decided to go to Boston.
6254343	eng	You loved doing that, didn't you?
6254344	eng	You knew Tom told Mary he was going to do that, didn't you?
6254345	eng	Tom figured he'd be able to do that.
6254346	eng	You look like you've lost weight.
6254347	eng	Tom wouldn't likely be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6254348	eng	Tom fell in love with his therapist.
6254349	eng	You look like you've been crying.
6254350	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
6254351	eng	Tom faces a mandatory life sentence.
6254352	eng	You look like you're half asleep.
6254353	eng	Tom won't likely forget to tell Mary he'll do that for her.
6254354	eng	Tom explained why we had to do that.
6254355	eng	You look like you're a bit tired.
6254356	eng	Tom won't likely forget to tell Mary he intends to do that.
6254357	eng	Tom explained why he didn't do that.
6254358	eng	You know who did that, don't you?
6254359	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he won't go to Boston with her.
6254360	eng	Tom eventually will need to do that.
6254361	eng	You knew I'd do that, didn't you?
6254362	eng	Tom was hoping he could go to Boston with Mary next summer.
6254363	eng	Tom eventually will have to do that.
6254364	eng	You just need to be more patient.
6254365	eng	Tom wanted to talk to Mary, but he didn't know what to say.
6254366	eng	Tom enjoyed fishing with his father.
6254367	eng	You have to learn how to do that.
6254368	eng	Tom told Mary that he was glad that she had come to Boston.
6254370	eng	You feel better today, don't you?
6254371	eng	Tom told Mary that he was finished doing that by lunchtime.
6254372	eng	Tom employs more than thirty people.
6254373	eng	You don't really need to do that.
6254374	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was a pretty good dancer.
6254375	eng	Tom earns just under $3,000 a month.
6254376	eng	You don't really do that, do you?
6254377	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was hesitant to do that.
6254378	eng	Tom earns his living as a guitarist.
6254379	eng	You don't look like you're tired.
6254380	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he wants her to do that.
6254381	eng	Tom earned his doctorate at Harvard.
6254382	eng	You don't look like you're ready.
6254383	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't intend to do that.
6254385	eng	You don't look like you're happy.
6254386	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he wants to quit his job.
6254387	eng	Tom said doing that would be a good idea.
6254388	eng	You don't look like you're angry.
6254389	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
6254390	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that tonight.
6254391	eng	You don't like cats much, do you?
6254392	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who she needs to give that to.
6254393	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that anymore.
6254394	eng	You don't have to read that book.
6254395	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can stop Mary from doing that.
6254396	eng	Tom doesn't want to be here anymore.
6254397	eng	You don't always do that, do you?
6254398	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that.
6254399	eng	Tom doesn't want children, but I do.
6254400	eng	You do that every day, don't you?
6254401	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't pass her French test.
6254402	eng	Tom doesn't think you would do that.
6254403	eng	You definitely needed to do that.
6254404	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wanted to go sailing with him.
6254405	eng	Tom doesn't think we should do that.
6254406	eng	You could've done that yesterday.
6254407	eng	Tom said that he doesn't think Mary can do that by herself.
6254408	eng	Tom doesn't think we did that right.
6254409	eng	You could probably do that alone.
6254410	eng	Tom said that Mary thought it would probably snow tomorrow.
6254411	eng	Tom doesn't think he should do that.
6254412	eng	You chose to do that, didn't you?
6254413	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that would be interesting.
6254414	eng	Tom doesn't think he has to do that.
6254415	eng	You can stay here if you want to.
6254416	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't think doing that would be enough.
6254417	eng	Tom doesn't think I know what to do.
6254418	eng	Would you mind doing that for me?
6254419	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary she shouldn't do that.
6254420	eng	Tom doesn't think I have to do that.
6254421	eng	Would you let me do that for you?
6254422	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary she needed to do that.
6254423	eng	Tom doesn't seem to want to be here.
6254424	eng	Would you close the gate, please?
6254425	eng	Tom said he wished he could play the banjo as well as Mary.
6254426	eng	Tom doesn't seem to share that view.
6254428	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy doing that with Mary.
6254429	eng	Tom doesn't seem to like doing that.
6254430	eng	Will you take a trip next summer?
6254431	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would probably be able to do that.
6254432	eng	Tom doesn't seem to do that anymore.
6254433	eng	Will you stay in Boston all week?
6254434	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that.
6254435	eng	Tom doesn't really have much choice.
6254436	eng	Will you come to school tomorrow?
6254437	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be permitted to do that.
6254438	eng	Tom doesn't realize what he's doing.
6254439	eng	Will you come here tomorrow, too?
6254440	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that by herself.
6254441	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that anymore.
6254442	eng	Will you be in Boston in October?
6254443	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not need to do that by herself.
6254444	eng	Tom doesn't look too happy, does he?
6254445	eng	Why don't you do that more often?
6254446	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that by herself.
6254447	eng	Tom doesn't like this kind of music.
6254448	eng	Why didn't you do that yesterday?
6254449	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be willing to do that for him.
6254450	eng	Tom doesn't like that kind of stuff.
6254451	eng	Why didn't you answer your phone?
6254452	eng	Tom said he doesn't think he can stop Mary from doing that.
6254453	eng	Tom doesn't know where he should be.
6254454	eng	Why did you want to go to Boston?
6254455	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that.
6254456	eng	Tom doesn't know what he has to buy.
6254457	eng	Why did you need to go to Boston?
6254458	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really has to do that again.
6254459	eng	Tom doesn't know there's work to do.
6254460	eng	Why did you have to go to Boston?
6254461	eng	Tom said he didn't want to ever go fishing with Mary again.
6254462	eng	Tom doesn't know how to play guitar.
6254463	eng	Who told you I'd want to do that?
6254464	eng	Tom said Mary will probably still be in Boston next Monday.
6254465	eng	Tom doesn't keep his room very tidy.
6254466	eng	Who told you I wanted to do that?
6254467	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't the one responsible for what happened.
6254468	eng	Tom doesn't intend to do that again.
6254469	eng	Who told you I needed to do that?
6254470	eng	Tom said Mary was trying to learn how to play the trombone.
6254471	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that anymore.
6254472	eng	Who else came to Boston with you?
6254473	eng	Tom said Mary was too out of shape to go mountain climbing.
6254474	eng	Tom doesn't have any enemies at all.
6254475	eng	Who doesn't do that occasionally?
6254476	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to get back from Boston on Monday.
6254478	eng	Who does this umbrella belong to?
6254479	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6254480	eng	Tom doesn't expect to stay too long.
6254481	eng	Which bicycle do you want to buy?
6254482	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be difficult to get along with.
6254483	eng	Tom doesn't consider himself a hero.
6254484	eng	When is the best time to do that?
6254485	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be required to do that.
6254486	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be getting up.
6254487	eng	When do you have to be in Boston?
6254488	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might need to do that by herself.
6254489	eng	Tom doesn't always do that this way.
6254490	eng	When did the children eat dinner?
6254491	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might have to do that by herself.
6254492	eng	Tom does that the old fashioned way.
6254493	eng	What's Australia most famous for?
6254494	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be permitted to do that.
6254495	eng	Tom does have some serious problems.
6254496	eng	What time do you want to do that?
6254497	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not have to do that again.
6254498	eng	Tom does have pretty good instincts.
6254499	eng	What kind of weather do you like?
6254500	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that.
6254501	eng	Tom does do that, but not very well.
6254502	eng	What kind of parties do you like?
6254503	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might have to do that on Monday.
6254504	eng	Tom died without having made a will.
6254505	eng	What do you want to do next week?
6254506	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
6254507	eng	Tom died three months ago in Boston.
6254508	eng	What are some possible solutions?
6254509	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not need to do that until 2:30.
6254510	eng	Tom died on the way to the hospital.
6254511	eng	Were you drunk when you did that?
6254512	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not need to do that by himself.
6254513	eng	Tom died on a cold night in October.
6254514	eng	We've visited Boston a few times.
6254515	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that until 2:30.
6254516	eng	Tom died of a drug overdose in 2013.
6254517	eng	We've had lots of fun doing that.
6254518	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that by himself.
6254519	eng	Tom died last year at the age of 30.
6254520	eng	We're prohibited from doing that.
6254521	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary not to do that.
6254522	eng	Tom died in a small house in Boston.
6254523	eng	We'll do that tomorrow, won't we?
6254524	eng	Tom probably knows where Mary was the day before yesterday.
6254525	eng	Tom died in Boston at the age of 30.
6254526	eng	We weren't in Boston last summer.
6254527	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6254528	eng	Tom died in 2013 from heart disease.
6254529	eng	We still can't afford to do that.
6254530	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary and John don't like him.
6254531	eng	Tom didn't think you should do that.
6254532	eng	We shouldn't have come to Boston.
6254533	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary will do that or not.
6254534	eng	Tom didn't testify during the trial.
6254535	eng	We should've done that yesterday.
6254536	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary was yesterday morning.
6254537	eng	Tom didn't seem to enjoy doing that.
6254538	eng	We should visit Boston next fall.
6254539	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is going next weekend.
6254540	eng	Tom didn't seem to be unhappy today.
6254541	eng	We often see monkeys around here.
6254542	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary wants to do that again.
6254543	eng	Tom didn't say he wanted to do that.
6254544	eng	We need to get this done by 2:30.
6254545	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary hasn't been very happy here.
6254546	eng	Tom didn't know who he should trust.
6254547	eng	We need to change more than that.
6254548	eng	Tom knows he won't be able to do what Mary wants him to do.
6254549	eng	Tom didn't know what was in the box.
6254550	eng	We might go to Boston next month.
6254551	eng	Tom is out on the porch trying to convince Mary to do that.
6254552	eng	Tom didn't know what should be done.
6254553	eng	We just went to Boston last week.
6254554	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will have the time to do that today.
6254555	eng	Tom didn't know how to open the box.
6254556	eng	We just came to Boston last week.
6254557	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be finished doing that by 2:30.
6254558	eng	Tom didn't know how long he'd slept.
6254559	eng	We did that as a publicity stunt.
6254560	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be difficult to get along with.
6254561	eng	Tom didn't know anything about that.
6254562	eng	We cut the watermelon and ate it.
6254563	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is the kind of person who'd do that.
6254564	eng	Tom didn't intend to break the vase.
6254565	eng	We can't ignore these complaints.
6254566	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is glad that that's going to happen.
6254567	eng	Tom didn't have to worry about that.
6254568	eng	Very few people actually do that.
6254569	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is good at doing that or not.
6254570	eng	Tom didn't have any help doing that.
6254571	eng	This time of year is always cold.
6254572	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary wants him to put her suitcases.
6254573	eng	Tom didn't have a chance to do that.
6254574	eng	This time of year is always busy.
6254575	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary wants him to plant the lettuce.
6254576	eng	Tom didn't get everything he wanted.
6254577	eng	This place looks like a cemetery.
6254578	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to tell John what to do.
6254579	eng	Tom didn't do what I told him to do.
6254580	eng	This morning's meeting was short.
6254581	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to tell John to do that.
6254582	eng	Tom didn't do that yesterday either.
6254583	eng	This knife needs to be sharpened.
6254584	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6254585	eng	Tom didn't actually want to do that.
6254586	eng	This is a very comfortable chair.
6254587	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be difficult to get along with.
6254588	eng	Tom didn't actually need to do that.
6254589	eng	This has been going on for years.
6254590	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was glad that that's going to happen.
6254591	eng	Tom didn't actually have to do that.
6254592	eng	This cave was discovered in 2013.
6254593	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was good at doing that or not.
6254594	eng	Tom didn't actually do that himself.
6254595	eng	This area is famous for its rice.
6254596	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was supposed to help him do that.
6254597	eng	Tom did whatever we asked him to do.
6254598	eng	They'll come with their children.
6254599	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wasn't supposed to do that by herself.
6254600	eng	Tom did whatever he felt like doing.
6254601	eng	They live in different countries.
6254602	eng	Tom denied that Mary was the one who wanted him to do that.
6254603	eng	Tom did that while we were sleeping.
6254604	eng	These lenses aren't scratchproof.
6254605	eng	Tom deleted all the pictures he had of Mary from his phone.
6254606	eng	Tom did that for two or three years.
6254607	eng	These jeans are too small for me.
6254608	eng	Tom asked Mary what she'd buy if she had a million dollars.
6254609	eng	Tom did that because he was told to.
6254610	eng	There's only one thing we can do.
6254611	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John was going to graduate.
6254612	eng	Tom did a lot of really good things.
6254614	eng	Tom and Mary don't kiss each other as much as they used to.
6254615	eng	Tom demanded that I do that for him.
6254616	eng	There's no way I'll ever do that.
6254617	eng	Tom and I were able to help Mary do what needed to be done.
6254618	eng	Tom definitely deserved what he got.
6254619	eng	There are now 300 employees here.
6254620	eng	Tom admitted to Mary that he didn't know what he was doing.
6254621	eng	Tom decided to study French instead.
6254622	eng	There are no suspects in custody.
6254623	eng	The only reason Tom did that was because Mary asked him to.
6254624	eng	Tom decided to go to Boston instead.
6254625	eng	The operation lasted three hours.
6254626	eng	Maybe Tom would like to try talking Mary out of doing that.
6254627	eng	Tom couldn't keep up with his class.
6254628	eng	The competition was pretty rough.
6254629	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary doesn't need to do that.
6254630	eng	Tom couldn't afford to see a doctor.
6254631	eng	That's not who I want to talk to.
6254632	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary doesn't have to do that.
6254633	eng	Tom could've been sentenced to life.
6254634	eng	That's not who I need to talk to.
6254635	eng	I think I heard Tom say that Mary was the one who did that.
6254636	eng	Tom could try doing that by himself.
6254637	eng	That's not who I have to talk to.
6254638	eng	I should probably tell Tom I want him to help Mary do that.
6254639	eng	Tom could never do that like you do.
6254640	eng	That's not what I promised to do.
6254641	eng	I don't think Tom will be able to convince Mary to do that.
6254642	eng	Tom could go to jail for doing that.
6254643	eng	Something might be going on here.
6254644	eng	I didn't tell Tom how much the gift I bought for Mary cost.
6254645	eng	Tom could do a lot of things for us.
6254646	eng	Some rules may have to be broken.
6254647	eng	I always thought Tom and Mary would eventually get married.
6254648	eng	Tom could be tried for manslaughter.
6254649	eng	Some people think I'm very fussy.
6254650	eng	Didn't you know Tom makes more than double what Mary makes?
6254651	eng	Tom could be immune to that disease.
6254652	eng	Silver is much cheaper than gold.
6254653	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other?
6254654	eng	Tom comes to see me once in a while.
6254655	eng	Schools will be closed on Monday.
6254656	eng	You knew Tom told Mary to ask John to do that, didn't you?
6254657	eng	Tom claims that things have changed.
6254658	eng	Please tell me about it tomorrow.
6254659	eng	We've all come to Boston to attend Tom and Mary's wedding.
6254660	eng	Tom claims he acted in self-defense.
6254661	eng	Please give me your phone number.
6254662	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he won't go to Boston with her.
6254663	eng	Tom claimed he had been brainwashed.
6254664	eng	Please give me some orange juice.
6254665	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary to take her umbrella with her.
6254666	eng	Tom can't seem to control his anger.
6254667	eng	Please don't do that by yourself.
6254668	eng	Tom wasn't planning on doing that until Mary asked him to.
6254669	eng	Tom can't have forgotten my address.
6254670	eng	Please do that today if possible.
6254671	eng	Tom was sure Mary didn't know she was supposed to do that.
6254672	eng	Tom can't have done that by himself.
6254673	eng	People around here often do that.
6254674	eng	Tom told Mary that she should do that as soon as possible.
6254675	eng	Tom can't do that without some help.
6254676	eng	People around here don't do that.
6254677	eng	Tom told Mary that she should be the first one to do that.
6254678	eng	Tom can't do that better than I can.
6254679	eng	Peaches are larger than apricots.
6254680	eng	Tom told Mary that she should be helping John do that now.
6254681	eng	Tom can't do anything right, can he?
6254682	eng	Our wedding anniversary is today.
6254683	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be in Boston next Monday.
6254684	eng	Tom can't be right about everything.
6254685	eng	Our store will reopen in October.
6254686	eng	Tom told Mary that he was the one who organized the party.
6254687	eng	Tom can do that with his bare hands.
6254688	eng	Our lives will never be the same.
6254689	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was through doing that.
6254690	eng	Tom can do that wherever he chooses.
6254691	eng	Now's the time we should do that.
6254692	eng	Tom told Mary that John was gone by the time he got there.
6254693	eng	Tom can do that anywhere he chooses.
6254694	eng	No two people look exactly alike.
6254695	eng	Tom thought Mary would be doing that later this afternoon.
6254696	eng	Tom came to school with a black eye.
6254697	eng	No one will be home this evening.
6254698	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't as cooperative as she should've been.
6254699	eng	Tom came to Boston twice last month.
6254700	eng	My wife's waiting for me at home.
6254701	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be able to convince John to do that.
6254702	eng	Tom came in third place in the race.
6254703	eng	My wife homeschools our children.
6254704	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably at the beach with her friends.
6254705	eng	Tom came in just as I was going out.
6254706	eng	My parents got married in Boston.
6254707	eng	Tom should tell Mary to come back home as soon as she can.
6254708	eng	Tom came down for breakfast at 6:30.
6254709	eng	My parents died when I was three.
6254710	eng	Tom should tell Mary he wants to find a higher-paying job.
6254711	eng	Tom came back home three days later.
6254712	eng	My parents aren't living anymore.
6254713	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary only what she needs to know.
6254714	eng	Tom built a fence around his garden.
6254715	eng	My parents are both still living.
6254716	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary was supposed to do that.
6254717	eng	Tom brushes his hair in the morning.
6254718	eng	My house is just down the street.
6254719	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him he had to do that.
6254720	eng	Tom bought that car three years ago.
6254721	eng	My house doesn't have a basement.
6254722	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't tell him he needs to do that.
6254723	eng	Tom bought every single one of them.
6254724	eng	My hamster escaped from its cage.
6254725	eng	Tom says he forgot to remind Mary that she had to do that.
6254726	eng	Tom believes his son is still alive.
6254727	eng	My girlfriend is older than I am.
6254728	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary would do that by herself.
6254729	eng	Tom ate potato chips and drank beer.
6254730	eng	My first wife was from Australia.
6254731	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that.
6254732	eng	Tom asked the police for protection.
6254733	eng	My first girlfriend was Canadian.
6254734	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John would do that to Alice.
6254735	eng	Tom asked me why I hadn't done that.
6254736	eng	My car is a lot older than yours.
6254737	eng	Tom saw you kissing Mary in the park a couple of days ago.
6254738	eng	Tom asked me where my parents lived.
6254739	eng	My car broke down on my way here.
6254740	eng	Tom said that isn't the real reason Mary wants to do that.
6254741	eng	Tom asked me when he should do that.
6254742	eng	My bedroom is cleaner than yours.
6254743	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the only one who had to do that.
6254744	eng	Tom asked me not to do that anymore.
6254745	eng	My French is gradually improving.
6254746	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary she ought to do that.
6254747	eng	Tom asked me if I'd like to do that.
6254748	eng	Mt. Fuji isn't visible from here.
6254749	eng	Tom said he was hoping he and Mary could do that together.
6254750	eng	Tom asked me if I wanted to do that.
6254751	eng	Mt. Fuji can't be seen from here.
6254752	eng	Tom said he wanted to give Mary another chance to do that.
6254753	eng	Tom asked for a glass of cold water.
6254754	eng	Morning is a bad time to do that.
6254755	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
6254756	eng	Tom arrived very early this morning.
6254757	eng	Monday will likely be a cold day.
6254758	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be asleep when he got home.
6254759	eng	Tom appears to be a friendly person.
6254760	eng	Monday will likely be a busy day.
6254761	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was having a good time in Boston.
6254762	eng	Tom apologized to me for being late.
6254763	eng	May I do that when I'm in Boston?
6254764	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might want to do that by herself.
6254765	eng	Tom and I've started fighting again.
6254766	eng	Mary is the tallest woman I know.
6254767	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be required to do that.
6254768	eng	Tom and I've decided to get married.
6254769	eng	Mary is the richest woman I know.
6254770	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that by herself.
6254771	eng	Tom and I've decided not to do that.
6254772	eng	Mary is the perfect woman for me.
6254773	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
6254774	eng	Tom and I've been seeing each other.
6254775	eng	Mary hasn't always had long hair.
6254776	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not need to do that on Monday.
6254777	eng	Tom and I've always lived in Boston.
6254778	eng	Let's wait until 2:30 to do that.
6254779	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that on Monday.
6254780	eng	Tom and I'll get married in October.
6254781	eng	Let's sit in the back of the bus.
6254782	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to come to his party.
6254783	eng	Tom and I'll be doing that together.
6254784	eng	Let's not go to Boston this year.
6254785	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary got home before it started raining.
6254786	eng	Tom and I work really well together.
6254787	eng	Let's have supper on the veranda.
6254788	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that with John.
6254789	eng	Tom and I work for the same company.
6254790	eng	Let me show you how to get there.
6254791	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really did that by herself.
6254792	eng	Tom and I were meant to be together.
6254793	eng	It's way too late to do that now.
6254794	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to tell Mary what had happened.
6254795	eng	Tom and I went to the park together.
6254796	eng	It's time to stop fooling around.
6254797	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to tell Mary about what we did.
6254798	eng	Tom and I went to the mall together.
6254799	eng	It's really very easy to do that.
6254800	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really had to do that today.
6254801	eng	Tom and I wear each other's clothes.
6254802	eng	It's little too early to do that.
6254803	eng	Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
6254804	eng	Tom and I walked to school together.
6254805	eng	It's hot and humid now in Boston.
6254806	eng	Tom said he didn't know Mary was going to have to do that.
6254807	eng	Tom and I walked back home together.
6254808	eng	It'll probably be fun to do that.
6254809	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who got here on time today.
6254811	eng	It wouldn't be simple to do that.
6254812	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be reluctant to do that.
6254813	eng	Tom and I took turns standing guard.
6254814	eng	It would've been wise to do that.
6254815	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be motivated to do that.
6254816	eng	Tom and I talked about the election.
6254817	eng	It would've been safe to do that.
6254818	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not have to do that again.
6254819	eng	Tom and I talked about our children.
6254820	eng	It would've been easy to do that.
6254821	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not be allowed to do that.
6254822	eng	Tom and I seldom talk to each other.
6254823	eng	It would be too risky to do that.
6254824	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might want to do that by himself.
6254825	eng	Tom and I sat together on the train.
6254826	eng	It would be smart to do that now.
6254827	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be required to do that.
6254828	eng	Tom and I sat together on the bench.
6254829	eng	It would be smart not to do that.
6254830	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might need to do that by himself.
6254831	eng	Tom and I sat on the bench together.
6254832	eng	It would be safer not to do that.
6254833	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might have to do that by himself.
6254834	eng	Tom and I played tennis all morning.
6254835	eng	It would be expensive to do that.
6254836	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be allowed to do that soon.
6254837	eng	Tom and I often take walks together.
6254838	eng	It won't be very easy to do that.
6254839	eng	Tom said Mary probably couldn't do that without some help.
6254840	eng	Tom and I often go cycling together.
6254841	eng	It was yesterday that I did that.
6254842	eng	Tom said Mary needed at least $300 to buy what she needed.
6254843	eng	Tom and I often eat dinner together.
6254844	eng	It sounds like I need to do that.
6254845	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be permitted to do that.
6254846	eng	Tom and Mary need to paint their house.
6254847	eng	It should be OK to do that today.
6254848	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that again today.
6254849	eng	Tom and I moved to Boston last fall.
6254850	eng	It seems that we have to do that.
6254851	eng	Tom said Mary isn't the one responsible for what happened.
6254852	eng	Tom and I love each other very much.
6254853	eng	It seems stupid to me to do that.
6254854	eng	Tom said Mary is very hungry every day when she gets home.
6254855	eng	Tom and I killed time playing cards.
6254856	eng	It doesn't look like you're sick.
6254857	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still troubled by what happened.
6254858	eng	Tom and I haven't changed our minds.
6254859	eng	It doesn't look like you're done.
6254860	eng	Tom probably won't be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6254861	eng	Tom and I have never been on a date.
6254862	eng	Is there any water in the bucket?
6254863	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6254864	eng	Tom and I have different priorities.
6254865	eng	Is there any salad dressing left?
6254866	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary can do that or not.
6254867	eng	Tom and I have a three-year-old son.
6254868	eng	Is there a faster way to do that?
6254869	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary went to kindergarten.
6254870	eng	Tom and I have a great relationship.
6254871	eng	Is there a better way to do that?
6254872	eng	Tom probably doesn't know if Mary wants to do that or not.
6254873	eng	Tom and I had a lot of time to talk.
6254874	eng	Is it true that you hate parties?
6254875	eng	Tom parked his car in the vacant lot next to Mary's house.
6254876	eng	Tom and I had a great time together.
6254877	eng	If you have time, please do that.
6254878	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he told her he'd never been married.
6254879	eng	Tom and I got here at the same time.
6254880	eng	If it doesn't rain, I'll do that.
6254881	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said he didn't understand French.
6254882	eng	Tom and I frequently study together.
6254883	eng	I've seen that movie three times.
6254884	eng	Tom is probably the only person who can help Mary do that.
6254885	eng	Tom and I don't have much in common.
6254886	eng	I've seen that happen many times.
6254887	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do what John wants her to do.
6254888	eng	Tom and I don't get along very well.
6254889	eng	I've never considered doing that.
6254890	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do what John tells her to do.
6254891	eng	Tom and I didn't look at each other.
6254892	eng	I've lost interest in doing that.
6254893	eng	Tom has already told Mary she won't be allowed to do that.
6254894	eng	Tom and I did what we could to help.
6254895	eng	I've done everything I had to do.
6254896	eng	Tom doesn't think we can trust Mary as much as we used to.
6254897	eng	Tom and I did our homework together.
6254898	eng	I've decided to do that tomorrow.
6254899	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be drunk at this time of day.
6254900	eng	Tom and I became friends right away.
6254901	eng	I've been told not do that again.
6254902	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be amused by what's going on.
6254903	eng	Tom and I aren't particularly close.
6254904	eng	I've been swimming all afternoon.
6254905	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be present at today's meeting.
6254906	eng	Tom and I are still studying French.
6254907	eng	I've been ordered not to do that.
6254908	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be able to do that by herself.
6254909	eng	Tom and I are related to each other.
6254910	eng	I've been asked to give a speech.
6254911	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary is going to be this afternoon.
6254912	eng	Tom and I are now dating each other.
6254913	eng	I've been asked to do that again.
6254914	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
6254915	eng	Tom and I are both going to do that.
6254916	eng	I've always lived on Park Street.
6254917	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be present at today's meeting.
6254918	eng	Tom and I answered at the same time.
6254919	eng	I'm too drunk to be of much help.
6254920	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be able to do that by herself.
6254921	eng	Tom and I almost never eat together.
6254922	eng	I'm the tallest boy in the class.
6254923	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary wanted to be alone.
6254924	eng	Tom always seems to be enthusiastic.
6254925	eng	I'm the tallest boy in our class.
6254926	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand what Mary was talking about.
6254927	eng	Tom always gets everything he wants.
6254928	eng	I'm the only person who did that.
6254929	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary wanted him to do that or not.
6254930	eng	Tom always does that in the evening.
6254931	eng	I'm the one who broke the window.
6254932	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary wanted him to put her suitcase.
6254933	eng	Tom agreed there was no easy answer.
6254934	eng	I'm sure I don't have to do that.
6254935	eng	Tom didn't believe that Mary would do something like that.
6254936	eng	Tom admitted he had help doing that.
6254937	eng	I'm supposed to do that tomorrow.
6254938	eng	Tom denied that Mary was the one who asked him to do that.
6254939	eng	Tom admits the system isn't perfect.
6254940	eng	I'm still not very good at chess.
6254941	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the supermarket to buy some bread.
6254942	eng	Tom actually didn't want to do that.
6254943	eng	I'm still considering doing that.
6254944	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what John's favorite movie was.
6254945	eng	Tom, however, has never been there.
6254946	eng	I'm reluctant to do that for you.
6254947	eng	Tom asked Mary if John was planning to do that on his own.
6254948	eng	Tom's spoken French is pretty good.
6254949	eng	I'm positive that that'll happen.
6254950	eng	Tom asked Mary if John was planning to do that by himself.
6254951	eng	Tom's shirt was stained with blood.
6254952	eng	I'm planning to do that tomorrow.
6254953	eng	Tom and I were able to help Mary do what she needed to do.
6254954	eng	Tom's office looks a lot like mine.
6254955	eng	I'm not supposed to do that here.
6254956	eng	Tom and I didn't know each other until Mary introduced us.
6254957	eng	Tom's not old enough to live alone.
6254958	eng	I'm not living in Boston anymore.
6254959	eng	Tom and I did our best to help Mary do what she had to do.
6254960	eng	Tom's mother told him to come home.
6254961	eng	I'm not as old as you think I am.
6254962	eng	Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's jewelry.
6254963	eng	Tom's last year in Boston was 2013.
6254964	eng	I'm miserable whenever I do that.
6254965	eng	Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's bicycle.
6254966	eng	Tom's house is near where he works.
6254967	eng	I'm in the construction business.
6254968	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what Mary told him he had to do.
6254969	eng	Tom's house burned down last night.
6254970	eng	I'm glad I don't need to do that.
6254971	eng	Tom accused Mary of stealing money from the cash register.
6254972	eng	Tom's first teacher was his mother.
6254973	eng	I'm glad I don't have to do that.
6254974	eng	Please tell Tom he shouldn't do that until Mary gets here.
6254975	eng	Tom's first novel came out in 2013.
6254976	eng	I'm busy now, so I can't do that.
6254977	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
6254978	eng	Tom's explanation was enlightening.
6254979	eng	I'm about the same height as you.
6254980	eng	I've never told Tom exactly how Mary and I met each other.
6254981	eng	Tom's business is doing quite well.
6254982	eng	I'll put the flowers in the vase.
6254983	eng	I told Tom I thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
6254984	eng	Tom's brothers are still in Boston.
6254985	eng	I'll never permit you to do that.
6254986	eng	I think Tom could've done that for Mary if he'd wanted to.
6254987	eng	Tom's advice often isn't very good.
6254988	eng	I'll do that in a couple of days.
6254989	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary didn't want to do that.
6254990	eng	Tom wouldn't have done it that way.
6254991	eng	I'll do that as quickly as I can.
6254992	eng	I don't know whether Tom is younger or older than Mary is.
6254993	eng	Tom would never do that by himself.
6254994	eng	I'll definitely do that tomorrow.
6254995	eng	I didn't really feel like going camping with Tom and Mary.
6254996	eng	Tom would never ask you to do that.
6254997	eng	I'll be glad to buy that for you.
6254998	eng	I asked Tom all the same questions that Mary had asked me.
6254999	eng	Tom would like you to do that, too.
6255000	eng	I'll be finished doing that soon.
6255001	eng	You didn't realize Tom had to help Mary do that, did you?
6255002	eng	Tom would get depressed doing that.
6255003	eng	I'd stay in Boston if I were you.
6255004	eng	Tom wouldn't likely be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6255005	eng	Tom would be a fool not to do that.
6255006	eng	I'd rather not do that by myself.
6255007	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that he wants her to do that.
6255008	eng	Tom worked in Boston all last week.
6255009	eng	I'd like to see somebody do that.
6255010	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he wants to find another job.
6255011	eng	Tom worked here until October 2013.
6255012	eng	I'd like to say yes, but I can't.
6255013	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he doesn't intend to do that.
6255014	eng	Tom worked hard writing his speech.
6255015	eng	I'd like to come over after work.
6255016	eng	Tom would be surprised if Mary couldn't do that.
6255017	eng	Tom won't listen to anything I say.
6255018	eng	I'd better go to Boston with you.
6255019	eng	Tom was the one who showed Mary how to tie a square knot.
6255020	eng	Tom won't likely refuse to do that.
6255021	eng	I'd be happy to teach you French.
6255022	eng	Tom told me he was very surprised to see Mary doing that.
6255023	eng	Tom won't likely be very organized.
6255024	eng	I'd be happy to buy that for you.
6255025	eng	Tom told Mary that she's faster at doing that than he is.
6255026	eng	Tom won't likely be home on Monday.
6255027	eng	I wouldn't want to do that again.
6255028	eng	Tom told Mary that she should be the next one to do that.
6255029	eng	Tom won't likely be here on Monday.
6255030	eng	I wonder if it's safe to do that.
6255031	eng	Tom told Mary that she should be the last one to do that.
6255032	eng	Tom won't likely be doing that now.
6255033	eng	I wonder if it's safe to be here.
6255034	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was home every Monday.
6255035	eng	Tom won't likely be afraid of that.
6255036	eng	I won't have to do that tomorrow.
6255037	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was disorganized.
6255038	eng	Tom won't have to do that tomorrow.
6255039	eng	I won't have a chance to do that.
6255040	eng	Tom told Mary that John would have to do that by himself.
6255041	eng	Tom won't do what he says he'll do.
6255042	eng	I won't do that until I get home.
6255043	eng	Tom thinks Mary would've come if someone had invited her.
6255044	eng	Tom won't be up this late at night.
6255045	eng	I wish I'd remembered to do that.
6255046	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be glad that that's going to happen.
6255047	eng	Tom won't be in Boston next Monday.
6255048	eng	I wish I'd known about the party.
6255049	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John to do that.
6255050	eng	Tom won't be in Boston much longer.
6255051	eng	I wish I were better at swimming.
6255052	eng	Tom swept the room with the new broom Mary had given him.
6255053	eng	Tom won't be able to do that again.
6255054	eng	I wish I had done that yesterday.
6255055	eng	Tom should try not to say anything that'll make Mary mad.
6255056	eng	Tom will wait as long as he has to.
6255057	eng	I wish I could understand French.
6255058	eng	Tom should try not to say anything that'll make Mary cry.
6255059	eng	Tom will stay here for three weeks.
6255060	eng	I wasn't the last one to do that.
6255061	eng	Tom should tell Mary that he doesn't know how to do that.
6255062	eng	Tom will probably be here tomorrow.
6255063	eng	I wasn't in my room at that time.
6255064	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to look out the window.
6255065	eng	Tom will probably be busy tomorrow.
6255066	eng	I wasn't brave enough to do that.
6255067	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to forgot her umbrella.
6255068	eng	Tom will probably agree to do that.
6255069	eng	I was kidnapped when I was three.
6255070	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to forget her umbrella.
6255071	eng	Tom will likely be absent tomorrow.
6255072	eng	I was in Boston on Christmas Day.
6255073	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't want to do that.
6255074	eng	Tom will go to Australia next week.
6255075	eng	I was going to work here all day.
6255076	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't need to do that.
6255077	eng	Tom will get the chance to do that.
6255078	eng	I was going to do that yesterday.
6255079	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't have to do that.
6255080	eng	Tom will figure out how to do that.
6255081	eng	I was going to do that by myself.
6255082	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary what she wants to know.
6255083	eng	Tom will be glad he didn't do that.
6255084	eng	I was asked not to do that again.
6255085	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary didn't want to do that.
6255086	eng	Tom went back to Australia in 2013.
6255087	eng	I was annoyed by the loud noises.
6255088	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him where Mary had gone.
6255089	eng	Tom wasn't ready to do that either.
6255090	eng	I wanted to go swimming with you.
6255091	eng	Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary had to do that.
6255092	eng	Tom wasn't punished for doing that.
6255093	eng	I want to talk about the project.
6255094	eng	Tom says if he does that, Mary will probably yell at him.
6255095	eng	Tom wasn't killed in the explosion.
6255096	eng	I want to take a picture of that.
6255097	eng	Tom says he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6255098	eng	Tom wasn't being forced to do that.
6255099	eng	I want to rent a house in Boston.
6255100	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't be at the meeting on Monday.
6255101	eng	Tom was very courageous to do that.
6255102	eng	I want to live in Boston someday.
6255103	eng	Tom says he knows Mary will want to go to Boston with us.
6255104	eng	Tom was too embarrassed to do that.
6255105	eng	I want to know why that happened.
6255106	eng	Tom says he knows Mary could do that if she tried harder.
6255107	eng	Tom was told to do that by himself.
6255108	eng	I want to know what you're doing.
6255109	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows she doesn't need to do that.
6255110	eng	Tom was the only adult in the room.
6255111	eng	I want to get a driver's license.
6255112	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows she doesn't have to do that.
6255113	eng	Tom was the last person to do that.
6255114	eng	I want to draw something for you.
6255115	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really enjoyed doing that.
6255116	eng	Tom was the first one to be chosen.
6255117	eng	I want to do that tomorrow night.
6255118	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really wants to do that.
6255119	eng	Tom was taken care of by his uncle.
6255120	eng	I want to buy some new furniture.
6255121	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that.
6255122	eng	Tom was swimming all day yesterday.
6255123	eng	I want to become rich and famous.
6255124	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wanted to help John do that.
6255125	eng	Tom was sitting near the window.
6255126	eng	I want to become a tattoo artist.
6255127	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary needed to help John do that.
6255128	eng	Tom was present at today's meeting.
6255129	eng	I used to be a volunteer fireman.
6255130	eng	Tom said that Mary thought the judge's decision was fair.
6255131	eng	Tom was my first saxophone teacher.
6255132	eng	I try to always keep my promises.
6255133	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that would be dangerous.
6255134	eng	Tom was more than three hours late.
6255135	eng	I told you never to call me here.
6255136	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't think doing that would be safe.
6255137	eng	Tom was in Boston last Monday, too.
6255138	eng	I told the team I wanted to quit.
6255139	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't think doing that would be easy.
6255140	eng	Tom was helping out in the kitchen.
6255141	eng	I thought you were still married.
6255142	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he'd do that.
6255143	eng	Tom was going to do that yesterday.
6255144	eng	I thought you didn't play tennis.
6255145	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary about what he did.
6255146	eng	Tom was doing that when I got home.
6255147	eng	I thought it was safe to do that.
6255148	eng	Tom said he wished Mary hadn't convinced John to do that.
6255149	eng	Tom was born on October 20th, 2013.
6255150	eng	I thought I'd do that, too.
6255151	eng	Tom said he was talking to Mary when the lights went out.
6255152	eng	Tom was afraid to go into the cave.
6255153	eng	I thought I was going to be late.
6255154	eng	Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6255155	eng	Tom was able to do that on his own.
6255156	eng	I thought I was down with a cold.
6255157	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
6255158	eng	Tom was a little late to the party.
6255159	eng	I think you're afraid to do that.
6255160	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not be allowed to do that.
6255161	eng	Tom wants to be at today's meeting.
6255162	eng	I think we'll be able to do that.
6255163	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that with John.
6255164	eng	Tom wanted to learn how to do that.
6255165	eng	I think we don't have to do that.
6255166	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that with John.
6255167	eng	Tom volunteered to help me do that.
6255168	eng	I think it'll rain all day today.
6255169	eng	Tom said he regretted that he couldn't help Mary do that.
6255170	eng	Tom usually drinks beer at parties.
6255171	eng	I think it'll be safe to do that.
6255172	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that tomorrow.
6255173	eng	Tom usually buys expensive clothes.
6255174	eng	I think doing that would be safe.
6255175	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be required to do that again.
6255176	eng	Tom understands French fairly well.
6255177	eng	I think I could help you do that.
6255178	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that tomorrow.
6255179	eng	Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
6255180	eng	I still haven't done my homework.
6255181	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really enjoyed doing that.
6255182	eng	Tom told us he would do that again.
6255183	eng	I still have to pack my suitcase.
6255184	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary needed to do that outside.
6255185	eng	Tom told the team he wants to quit.
6255186	eng	I still have to do that, don't I?
6255187	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary went to kindergarten.
6255188	eng	Tom told me you could speak French.
6255189	eng	I still go to Boston every month.
6255190	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really knew how to do that.
6255191	eng	Tom told me that he'd be back soon.
6255192	eng	I slept on a cot in the basement.
6255193	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be hesitant to do that.
6255194	eng	Tom told me that he was frightened.
6255195	eng	I shouldn't have even been there.
6255196	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be unenthusiastic about that.
6255197	eng	Tom told me that I'm overconfident.
6255198	eng	I should've shopped around a bit.
6255199	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be troubled by what happened.
6255200	eng	Tom told me not to do that anymore.
6255201	eng	I should've done that last night.
6255202	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be through doing that by now.
6255203	eng	Tom told me never to do that again.
6255204	eng	I should've been at that meeting.
6255205	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not have to do that today.
6255206	eng	Tom told me he'll do that tomorrow.
6255207	eng	I should've been able to do that.
6255208	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
6255209	eng	Tom told me he won't do that again.
6255210	eng	I should really buy one of those.
6255211	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be permitted to do that.
6255212	eng	Tom told me he was teaching French.
6255213	eng	I should go to Boston next month.
6255214	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed at the party so long.
6255215	eng	Tom told me he was studying French.
6255216	eng	I should do something about that.
6255217	eng	Tom said Mary probably couldn't do that without his help.
6255218	eng	Tom told me he knew how to do that.
6255219	eng	I should at least try to do that.
6255220	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be permitted to do that.
6255221	eng	Tom told me he intended to do that.
6255222	eng	I seldom have to do that anymore.
6255223	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might be required to do that again.
6255224	eng	Tom told me he didn't teach French.
6255225	eng	I saw three elephants at the zoo.
6255226	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that by himself.
6255227	eng	Tom told me he didn't study French.
6255228	eng	I said I'd be willing to do that.
6255229	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be required to do that.
6255230	eng	Tom told me he didn't speak French.
6255231	eng	I really, really want to do that.
6255232	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might need to do that by himself.
6255233	eng	Tom told himself that he should go.
6255234	eng	I plan to teach French next year.
6255235	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
6255236	eng	Tom thought it would be a long war.
6255237	eng	I plan to study French next year.
6255238	eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John can do that or not.
6255239	eng	Tom thought he should study French.
6255240	eng	I plan to live in Boston someday.
6255241	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still interested in doing that.
6255242	eng	Tom thought he had to study French.
6255243	eng	I plan to be in Boston all month.
6255244	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that by himself.
6255245	eng	Tom thought he had to speak French.
6255246	eng	I ought to go to Boston with you.
6255247	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know why Mary called the police.
6255248	eng	Tom thinks you should study French.
6255249	eng	I only saw one person doing that.
6255250	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know why Mary and John broke up.
6255251	eng	Tom thinks whales are worth saving.
6255252	eng	I never should've gone to Boston.
6255253	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary would want to do that.
6255254	eng	Tom thinks he can probably do that.
6255255	eng	I never should've come to Boston.
6255256	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wants John to do that.
6255257	eng	Tom thinks I have to do that today.
6255258	eng	I never said that I wanted to go.
6255259	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary dropped out of school.
6255260	eng	Tom thinks I don't know what to do.
6255261	eng	I never said I wanted to do that.
6255262	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary likes dogs or not.
6255263	eng	Tom thinks I don't have to do that.
6255264	eng	I never do that unless I have to.
6255265	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is thirsty or not.
6255266	eng	Tom taught me a new way to do that.
6255267	eng	I need to go to Boston next week.
6255268	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what Mary would like him to do.
6255269	eng	Tom talked about what had happened.
6255270	eng	I need to find someplace to live.
6255271	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary knows how to do that.
6255272	eng	Tom takes care of me when I'm sick.
6255273	eng	I need to do that sometime today.
6255274	eng	Tom let Mary know that he didn't like her.
6255275	eng	Tom suggested we visit that museum.
6255276	eng	I need a special tool to do that.
6255277	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to know why Mary was there.
6255278	eng	Tom suggested we leave immediately.
6255279	eng	I might work in Boston next year.
6255280	eng	Tom is the only boy in the class who thinks Mary is cute.
6255281	eng	Tom suggested that we take a break.
6255282	eng	I may not go to Boston next week.
6255283	eng	Tom is sure Mary didn't know she was supposed to do that.
6255284	eng	Tom suggested that we study French.
6255285	eng	I looked for my name on the list.
6255286	eng	Tom is going to take care of Mary's dog while she's away.
6255287	eng	Tom suggested that we speak French.
6255288	eng	I looked around the waiting room.
6255289	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows she has to do what John asks her to do.
6255291	eng	I live in a very small apartment.
6255292	eng	Tom hoped Mary would be well enough to come to his party.
6255293	eng	Tom studied French for a long time.
6255294	eng	I know you want to do that today.
6255295	eng	Tom has already told Mary how much the tickets will cost.
6255296	eng	Tom studied French for a few years.
6255297	eng	I know you need to do that today.
6255298	eng	Tom has already told Mary he doesn't want her to do that.

6255300	eng	I know you have to do that today.
6255301	eng	Tom has already told Mary he doesn't know how to do that.
6255302	eng	Tom strongly advised me to do that.
6255303	eng	I know why you wanted to do that.
6255304	eng	Tom got a book down from the shelf and handed it to Mary.
6255305	eng	Tom stood up and walked to the bar.
6255306	eng	I know why you needed to do that.
6255307	eng	Tom doesn't want to know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6255308	eng	Tom still wants to do that someday.
6255309	eng	I know why I should've done that.
6255310	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be surprised if he did that.
6255311	eng	Tom still sometimes studies French.
6255312	eng	I know where the money is hidden.
6255313	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be interested in doing that.
6255314	eng	Tom still says he doesn't blame me.
6255315	eng	I know what you need to do today.
6255316	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be amused by what's going on.
6255317	eng	Tom still isn't very good at chess.
6255318	eng	I know what you have to do today.
6255319	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary and John don't like each other.
6255320	eng	Tom still hasn't weeded the garden.
6255321	eng	I know what I've got to do today.
6255322	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is good at swimming or not.
6255323	eng	Tom still hasn't gotten out of bed.
6255324	eng	I know we've got to keep working.
6255325	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary intended to do that or not.
6255326	eng	Tom still hasn't done that, has he?
6255327	eng	I know we're running out of time.
6255328	eng	Tom doesn't know how much time Mary will need to do that.
6255329	eng	Tom still has to finish doing that.
6255330	eng	I know this is a tough situation.
6255331	eng	Tom doesn't know how much time Mary will have to do that.
6255332	eng	Tom still doesn't do that, does he?
6255333	eng	I know that you're uncomfortable.
6255334	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary well enough to know what she'll do.
6255335	eng	Tom stayed at home with his family.
6255336	eng	I know that you were unimpressed.
6255337	eng	Tom didn't want to know why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6255338	eng	Tom started his first band in 2013.
6255339	eng	I know that what I did was wrong.
6255340	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be doing that this afternoon.
6255341	eng	Tom spent the whole day doing that.
6255342	eng	I know that I'm ready to do that.
6255343	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary wanted to do that.
6255344	eng	Tom spent several months in Boston.
6255345	eng	I know exactly what I need to do.
6255346	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary shouldn't do that.
6255347	eng	Tom spent much of his time reading.
6255348	eng	I know I've got to do that today.
6255349	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary needed to do that.
6255350	eng	Tom spent a lot of time doing that.
6255351	eng	I know I was supposed to do that.
6255352	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was good at swimming or not.
6255353	eng	Tom spends a lot of money on shoes.
6255354	eng	I know I shouldn't do that alone.
6255355	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was going to do that or not.
6255356	eng	Tom sometimes eats lunch here, too.
6255357	eng	I know I shouldn't do that again.
6255358	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary wanted him to plant the roses.
6255359	eng	Tom slammed his fists on the table.
6255360	eng	I know I don't have long to live.
6255361	eng	Tom did everything he could to keep Mary from doing that.
6255362	eng	Tom simply wouldn't have done that.
6255363	eng	I know I don't have enough money.
6255364	eng	Tom denied that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
6255365	eng	Tom shows no signs of slowing down.
6255366	eng	I know I can always count on you.
6255367	eng	Tom denied that Mary was the one who told him to do that.
6255368	eng	Tom showed me a new way to do that.
6255369	eng	I knew I was supposed to do that.
6255370	eng	Tom could tell that Mary didn't think it was a good idea.
6255371	eng	Tom showed an interest in the book.
6255372	eng	I hope we didn't break any rules.
6255373	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew where John had graduated from.
6255374	eng	Tom shoveled the snow off the roof.
6255375	eng	I hope to live in Boston someday.
6255376	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John was going to arrive.
6255377	eng	Tom shouldn't have risked his life.
6255378	eng	I hope to be in Boston next week.
6255379	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what kind of music John liked.
6255380	eng	Tom shouldn't have gotten involved.
6255381	eng	I hope it isn't raining tomorrow.
6255382	eng	Tom asked Mary if John was planning to do that this week.
6255383	eng	Tom should've understood the rules.
6255384	eng	I heard children playing outside.
6255385	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other for about three years.
6255386	eng	Tom should've shopped around a bit.
6255387	eng	I haven't spoken French in years.
6255388	eng	Tom and Mary don't sing together as much as they used to.
6255389	eng	Tom should've never gone to Boston.
6255390	eng	I have visited Boston many times.
6255391	eng	Tom advised Mary to take the money she was being offered.
6255392	eng	Tom should've never come to Boston.
6255393	eng	I have to do that sometime today.
6255394	eng	Tom advised Mary not to waste her time trying to do that.
6255395	eng	Tom should've gone a long time ago.
6255396	eng	I have to be in Boston on Monday.
6255397	eng	Maybe Tom would like to try talking Mary into doing that.
6255398	eng	Tom should've done that last night.
6255399	eng	I have time to do that this week.
6255400	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary is the one who did that.
6255401	eng	Tom should've done that by himself.
6255402	eng	I have time to do that right now.
6255403	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be ready if Mary hadn't helped him.
6255404	eng	Tom should've been in the hospital.
6255405	eng	I have three cats and three dogs.
6255406	eng	I don't think Tom really enjoys playing tennis with Mary.
6255407	eng	Tom should've been fired years ago.
6255408	eng	I had no idea I was being conned.
6255409	eng	I didn't know that Tom was supposed to help Mary do that.
6255410	eng	Tom should've been at that meeting.
6255411	eng	I got really tired of doing that.
6255412	eng	Does Tom still play chess with Mary every Monday evening?
6255413	eng	Tom should've been able to do that.
6255414	eng	I found it impossible to do that.
6255415	eng	Didn't you know that Tom and Mary often do that together?
6255416	eng	Tom should be motivated to do that.
6255417	eng	I filled both glasses with water.
6255418	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that if Mary hadn't asked him to.
6255419	eng	Tom should at least try to do that.
6255420	eng	I figured I'd be able to do that.
6255421	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted him to put her suitcases.
6255422	eng	Tom set the tray down on the table.
6255423	eng	I felt like doing that yesterday.
6255424	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary that he wants her to do that.
6255425	eng	Tom seldom gives his wife presents.
6255426	eng	I fell asleep in front of the TV.
6255427	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he doesn't intend to do that.
6255428	eng	Tom seldom forgets to pay his rent.
6255429	eng	I feel like doing that right now.
6255430	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary only what she needs to know.
6255431	eng	Tom seems to want to do that today.
6255432	eng	Tom was the one who taught Mary how to play the G chord.
6255433	eng	Tom seems to enjoy teaching French.
6255434	eng	I don't want to work as a waiter.
6255435	eng	Tom warned Mary what would happen if she didn't do that.
6255436	eng	Tom seems to enjoy studying French.
6255437	eng	I don't want to wear any jewelry.
6255438	eng	Tom told me that he thought Mary could probably do that.
6255439	eng	Tom seems to enjoy speaking French.
6255440	eng	I don't want to take that chance.
6255441	eng	Tom told Mary to stop doing that, but she did it anyway.
6255442	eng	Tom seems to be willing to do that.
6255443	eng	I don't want to help you do that.
6255444	eng	Tom told Mary that she should try to do that by herself.
6255445	eng	Tom seems to be feeling frustrated.
6255446	eng	I don't want to go anywhere else.
6255447	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to quit being so stubborn.
6255448	eng	Tom seems aware of what's going on.
6255449	eng	I don't want to do that with you.
6255450	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was engaged to Alice.
6255451	eng	Tom seemed to be unhappy yesterday.
6255452	eng	I don't want to do that tomorrow.
6255453	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John could likely do that.
6255454	eng	Tom seemed to be afraid to do that.
6255455	eng	I don't want to do that that way.
6255456	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was intelligent.
6255457	eng	Tom seemed to be a really good guy.
6255458	eng	I don't want to borrow any money.
6255459	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was incompetent.
6255460	eng	Tom seemed to be a nice enough guy.
6255461	eng	I don't want anyone else to know.
6255462	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was hardworking.
6255463	eng	Tom seemed like an intelligent man.
6255464	eng	I don't visit my parents anymore.
6255465	eng	Tom told Mary that John was difficult to get along with.
6255466	eng	Tom says this will be his last try.
6255467	eng	I don't usually watch war movies.
6255468	eng	Tom thought it wasn't the first time Mary had done that.
6255469	eng	Tom says there's nothing he can do.
6255470	eng	I don't think I'll do that again.
6255471	eng	Tom thought Mary wouldn't likely be busy in the morning.
6255472	eng	Tom says that's his favorite store.
6255473	eng	I don't think I'll be doing that.
6255474	eng	Tom thought Mary would be gone by the time we got there.
6255475	eng	Tom says that's his favorite movie.
6255476	eng	I don't think I need a bodyguard.
6255477	eng	Tom thinks that Mary doesn't know that John can do that.
6255478	eng	Tom says that he's good at cooking.
6255479	eng	I don't really understand French.
6255480	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be busy after 2:30 this afternoon.
6255481	eng	Tom says that he'd like to do that.
6255482	eng	I don't really care what you buy.
6255483	eng	Tom still doesn't know why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6255484	eng	Tom says that doesn't surprise him.
6255485	eng	I don't play baseball very often.
6255486	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
6255487	eng	Tom says it's up to you to do that.
6255488	eng	I don't often wear a tie anymore.
6255489	eng	Tom shouldn't have tried doing that without Mary's help.
6255490	eng	Tom says it didn't happen that way.
6255491	eng	I don't often do that in October.
6255492	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to forget to water the flowers.
6255493	eng	Tom says his goals haven't changed.
6255494	eng	I don't object to you doing that.
6255496	eng	Tom says he's tired of watching TV.
6255497	eng	I don't need to worry about that.
6255498	eng	Tom should tell Mary he'd never do anything to hurt her.
6255499	eng	Tom says he plays the drums well.
6255500	eng	I don't need to work next Monday.
6255501	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that she needs to do that.
6255502	eng	Tom says he's not enjoying himself.
6255503	eng	I don't need to know the details.
6255505	eng	Tom says he's never studied French.
6255506	eng	I don't need to go to work today.
6255507	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary why he had to do that.
6255508	eng	Tom says he's done that many times.
6255509	eng	I don't need to do anything else.
6255510	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary that he can't do that.
6255511	eng	Tom says he'll do what he needs to.
6255512	eng	I don't need to be here tomorrow.
6255513	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he's going to do that.
6255514	eng	Tom says he'll come to Boston soon.
6255515	eng	I don't need any more volunteers.
6255516	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he intends to do that.
6255517	eng	Tom says he'd like to study French.
6255518	eng	I don't need any help doing that.
6255519	eng	Tom set the table while Mary was in the kitchen cooking.
6255520	eng	Tom says he won't do that tomorrow.
6255521	eng	I don't mind buying that for you.
6255522	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary wanted him to do that.
6255523	eng	Tom says he won't buy that for you.
6255524	eng	I don't like the way you do that.
6255525	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary didn't want him there.
6255526	eng	Tom says he was abducted by aliens.
6255527	eng	I don't like playing video games.
6255528	eng	Tom says that he'll study French with Mary this evening.
6255529	eng	Tom says he wants to build a house.
6255530	eng	I don't like driving in the rain.
6255531	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't have to do that by herself.
6255532	eng	Tom says he thinks it's impossible.
6255533	eng	I don't know who baked this cake.
6255534	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't tell him he should do that.
6255535	eng	Tom says he spoke without thinking.
6255536	eng	I don't know much about baseball.
6255537	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't tell him he has to do that.
6255538	eng	Tom says he spoke French last week.
6255539	eng	I don't know if I'll come or not.
6255540	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who to give the package to.
6255541	eng	Tom says he needs another computer.
6255542	eng	I don't know how to write poetry.
6255543	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't say she wants to do that.
6255544	eng	Tom says he needed to study French.
6255545	eng	I don't know how much it'll cost.
6255546	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't say she needs to do that.
6255547	eng	Tom says he knows why you did that.
6255548	eng	I don't know everyone's name yet.
6255549	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really wanted to do that.
6255550	eng	Tom says he hopes that you do that.
6255551	eng	I don't know anyone who can help.
6255552	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really needed to do that.
6255553	eng	Tom says he enjoys teaching French.
6255554	eng	I don't know a lot about animals.
6255555	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really enjoys doing that.
6255556	eng	Tom says he enjoys studying French.
6255557	eng	I don't have very much free time.
6255558	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6255559	eng	Tom says he enjoys speaking French.
6255560	eng	I don't have to worry about that.
6255561	eng	Tom says he doesn't know who Mary wants to do that with.
6255562	eng	Tom says he doesn't have insurance.
6255563	eng	I don't have to work next Monday.
6255564	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would eventually leave him.
6255565	eng	Tom says he didn't want to do that.
6255566	eng	I don't have to do anything else.
6255567	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John would do that to Alice.
6255568	eng	Tom says he didn't need to do that.
6255569	eng	I don't have to be here tomorrow.
6255570	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John would do that to you.
6255571	eng	Tom says he didn't have to do that.
6255572	eng	I don't have the time to do that.
6255573	eng	Tom said there wasn't anything he could do to help Mary.
6255574	eng	Tom says he did that for the money.
6255575	eng	I don't have the guts to do that.
6255576	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to borrow some money from him.
6255577	eng	Tom says he can't stand doing that.
6255578	eng	I don't have much longer to live.
6255579	eng	Tom said it wouldn't be any trouble to do that for Mary.
6255580	eng	Tom says he can do that by himself.
6255581	eng	I don't have any books in French.
6255582	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary she should do that.
6255583	eng	Tom says Boston is really cold now.
6255584	eng	I don't have a say in the matter.
6255585	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary she had to do that.
6255586	eng	Tom sat there with his eyes closed.
6255587	eng	I don't expect to stay very long.
6255588	eng	Tom said it was him who should show Mary how to do that.
6255589	eng	Tom sat there with his arms folded.
6255590	eng	I don't ever want to get married.
6255591	eng	Tom said he wished Mary hadn't convinced him to do that.
6255592	eng	Tom said we had to start somewhere.
6255593	eng	I don't ever come here by myself.
6255594	eng	Tom said he thought that Mary wouldn't do that tomorrow.
6255595	eng	Tom said there's nothing he can do.
6255596	eng	I don't enjoy doing that anymore.
6255597	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't good at speaking French.
6255598	eng	Tom said the timing was just right.
6255600	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was in her room reading a book.
6255601	eng	Tom said the mission was too risky.
6255602	eng	I don't do that unless I have to.
6255603	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that for John.
6255604	eng	Tom said the explosion woke him up.
6255605	eng	I don't care how expensive it is.
6255606	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that for John.
6255607	eng	Tom said the concert was a success.
6255608	eng	I don't actually want to do that.
6255609	eng	Tom said he sees Mary waiting for the bus every morning.
6255610	eng	Tom said that's not what he wanted.
6255611	eng	I don't actually need to do that.
6255612	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that anymore.
6255613	eng	Tom said that's his favorite store.
6255614	eng	I don't actually have to do that.
6255615	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be permitted to do that.
6255616	eng	Tom said that we should be careful.
6255617	eng	I do hope you'll come back again.
6255618	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that anymore.
6255619	eng	Tom said that he'd like to do that.
6255620	eng	I didn't want to wait any longer.
6255621	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wanted to do that.
6255622	eng	Tom said that he wanted to do that.
6255623	eng	I didn't want to talk to anybody.
6255624	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needed to do that.
6255625	eng	Tom said that he wanted some money.
6255626	eng	I didn't want to talk about work.
6255627	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really enjoys doing that.
6255628	eng	Tom said that he needed some money.
6255629	eng	I didn't want to talk about that.
6255630	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to do that anymore.
6255631	eng	Tom said that he grew up in Boston.
6255632	eng	I didn't want to speak to anyone.
6255633	eng	Tom said he didn't think you should ask Mary to do that.
6255634	eng	Tom said some men had attacked him.
6255635	eng	I didn't want to speak in French.
6255636	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really enjoyed doing that.
6255637	eng	Tom said people just need to relax.
6255638	eng	I didn't want to leave the house.
6255639	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to do that anymore.
6255640	eng	Tom said no injuries were reported.
6255641	eng	I didn't want to go to Australia.
6255642	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6255643	eng	Tom said no decision had been made.
6255644	eng	I didn't want to go there by bus.
6255645	eng	Tom said Mary was told not to try to do that by herself.
6255646	eng	Tom said it didn't happen that way.
6255647	eng	I didn't want to go back to jail.
6255648	eng	Tom said Mary was the one responsible for what happened.
6255649	eng	Tom said his team would likely win.
6255650	eng	I didn't want to get up so early.
6255651	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be willing to do that.
6255652	eng	Tom said his schedule would change.
6255653	eng	I didn't want to do that tonight.
6255654	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be the first one to do that.
6255655	eng	Tom said his license was suspended.
6255656	eng	I didn't want to come here today.
6255657	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be interested in doing that.
6255658	eng	Tom said his goals haven't changed.
6255660	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be finished doing that by now.
6255661	eng	Tom said he's taught French before.
6255662	eng	I didn't think you'd be so early.
6255663	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be permitted to do that.
6255664	eng	Tom said he's reluctant to do that.
6255665	eng	I didn't think you'd be punctual.
6255666	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that.
6255667	eng	Tom said he's never studied French.
6255668	eng	I didn't think you would do that.
6255669	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be required to do that.
6255670	eng	Tom said he's never driven a truck.
6255671	eng	I didn't think you could do that.
6255672	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might need to do that by herself.
6255673	eng	Tom said he's never been to Boston.
6255674	eng	I didn't think I'd be handcuffed.
6255675	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that on her own.
6255676	eng	Tom said he's motivated to do that.
6255677	eng	I didn't think I would be scared.
6255678	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that by herself.
6255679	eng	Tom said he's desperate to do that.
6255680	eng	I didn't think I would be lonely.
6255681	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be permitted to do that.
6255682	eng	Tom said he's confident of success.
6255683	eng	I didn't take very many pictures.
6255684	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might not be allowed to do that.
6255685	eng	Tom said he's been very happy here.
6255686	eng	I didn't study at all last night.
6255687	eng	Tom said Mary has been here at least three times before.
6255688	eng	Tom said he's been told to do that.
6255689	eng	I didn't see anyone I recognized.
6255690	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John would do that for Alice.
6255691	eng	Tom said he's been arrested before.
6255692	eng	I didn't really know what to say.
6255693	eng	Tom probably knew before we did that Mary would do that.
6255694	eng	Tom said he's always been athletic.
6255695	eng	I didn't really enjoy doing that.
6255696	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know why Mary wants to do that.
6255697	eng	Tom said he'd be afraid to do that.
6255698	eng	I didn't realize how lucky I was.
6255699	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary went to the hospital.
6255700	eng	Tom said he wouldn't do that today.
6255701	eng	I didn't practice much last week.
6255702	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is afraid to do that.
6255703	eng	Tom said he would do that tomorrow.
6255704	eng	I didn't need to go there myself.
6255705	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary and John are arguing.
6255706	eng	Tom said he won't agree to do that.
6255707	eng	I didn't mean to say what I said.
6255708	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is sleepy or not.
6255709	eng	Tom said he wished he'd eaten more.
6255710	eng	I didn't make it home last night.
6255711	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is hungry or not.
6255712	eng	Tom said he wasn't having much fun.
6255713	eng	I didn't like living in the city.
6255714	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary can drive or not.
6255715	eng	Tom said he was willing to help us.
6255716	eng	I didn't know who I should trust.
6255717	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what Mary thinks he should do.
6255718	eng	Tom said he was too young to drive.
6255719	eng	I didn't know which road to take.
6255720	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
6255721	eng	Tom said he was too young to drink.
6255722	eng	I didn't know the gun was loaded.
6255723	eng	Tom must've thought Mary didn't have a driver's license.
6255724	eng	Tom said he was too shy to do that.
6255725	eng	I didn't have to stay, but I did.
6255726	eng	Tom is still playing chess with Mary in the dining room.
6255727	eng	Tom said he was too old to do that.
6255728	eng	I didn't have to help, but I did.
6255729	eng	Tom is hoping he can go to Boston with Mary next summer.
6255730	eng	Tom said he was sick of doing that.
6255731	eng	I didn't have to get up so early.
6255732	eng	Tom has already told Mary to take her umbrella with her.
6255733	eng	Tom said he was enjoying the party.
6255734	eng	I didn't have time for breakfast.
6255735	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be the first one to do that.
6255736	eng	Tom said he wants to join our band.
6255737	eng	I didn't have any fun doing that.
6255738	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be interested in doing that.
6255739	eng	Tom said he wants to be a mechanic.
6255740	eng	I didn't go to any classes today.
6255741	eng	Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to help Mary do that.
6255742	eng	Tom said he wanted to write a book.
6255743	eng	I didn't get tired of doing that.
6255744	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary well enough to ask her to do that.
6255745	eng	Tom said he wanted to study French.
6255746	eng	I didn't get paid for doing that.
6255747	eng	Tom didn't want to know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6255748	eng	Tom said he wanted to be a teacher.
6255749	eng	I didn't get everything I wanted.
6255750	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be interested in doing that.
6255751	eng	Tom said he wanted to be a dentist.
6255752	eng	I didn't get everything I needed.
6255753	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be cooperative, but she was.
6255754	eng	Tom said he tries to be optimistic.
6255755	eng	I didn't get anything done today.
6255756	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary that she needed to be more careful.
6255757	eng	Tom said he thought I looked happy.
6255758	eng	I didn't get a chance to do that.
6255759	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary that he didn't know how to do that.
6255760	eng	Tom said he thought I looked bored.
6255761	eng	I didn't feel much like studying.
6255762	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary wanted to do that.
6255763	eng	Tom said he regretted the decision.
6255764	eng	I didn't expect to do that again.
6255765	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary shouldn't do that.
6255766	eng	Tom said he regrets not doing that.
6255767	eng	I didn't expect a surprise party.
6255768	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary needed to do that.
6255769	eng	Tom said he now regrets doing that.
6255770	eng	I didn't eat any more than usual.
6255771	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary intended to do that or not.
6255772	eng	Tom said he needed to study French.
6255773	eng	I didn't do well on today's test.
6255774	eng	Tom didn't know if Mary would be able to do that or not.
6255775	eng	Tom said he needed to get some air.
6255776	eng	I didn't do anything for a while.
6255777	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to do that by herself.
6255778	eng	Tom said he knew what was going on.
6255779	eng	I didn't complain about anything.
6255780	eng	Tom did everything he thought Mary would want him to do.
6255781	eng	Tom said he knew it was time to go.
6255782	eng	I didn't buy everything I wanted.
6255783	eng	Tom denied that he was the one who told Mary to do that.
6255784	eng	Tom said he isn't going to help us.
6255785	eng	I didn't buy everything I needed.
6255786	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John had been in Boston.
6255787	eng	Tom said he hoped he could do that.
6255788	eng	I didn't actually do that myself.
6255789	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what kind of food John liked.
6255790	eng	Tom said he has to call the police.
6255791	eng	I did what I thought I should do.
6255792	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't agree on what color carpet to buy.
6255793	eng	Tom said he had trouble doing that.
6255794	eng	I did that until I was exhausted.
6255795	eng	Tom and I were able to help Mary do what had to be done.
6255797	eng	I did that the way you suggested.
6255798	eng	Tom advised Mary to come back home as soon as she could.
6255799	eng	Tom said he had three dogs at home.
6255800	eng	I did that for a while yesterday.
6255801	eng	Tom admitted to Mary that he didn't know how to do that.
6255802	eng	Tom said he had a surprise for you.
6255803	eng	I did everything I could to help.
6255804	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary hasn't been very happy here.
6255805	eng	Tom said he felt he had to do that.
6255806	eng	I couldn't have done that better.
6255807	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me where Mary had gone.
6255808	eng	Tom said he enjoys teaching French.
6255809	eng	I could come to Boston next week.
6255810	eng	I told Tom that I thought Mary might be able to do that.
6255811	eng	Tom said he enjoys studying French.
6255812	eng	I can help you if you want me to.
6255813	eng	I didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary what to do.
6255814	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help us.
6255815	eng	I can do that with my bare hands.
6255816	eng	I didn't think Tom would forget to tell Mary to do that.
6255817	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to sing.
6255818	eng	I brought you something to drink.
6255819	eng	I didn't know that Tom would be here until Mary told me.
6255821	eng	I broke my arm trying to do that.
6255822	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to do that with Mary?
6255823	eng	Tom said he didn't feel threatened.
6255824	eng	I attempted to do that yesterday.
6255825	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were married to each other?
6255826	eng	Tom said he didn't do that anymore.
6255827	eng	I already know what I have to do.
6255828	eng	Are you sure Tom didn't know Mary wasn't having any fun?
6255829	eng	Tom said he couldn't do that today.
6255830	eng	How should I go about doing that?
6255831	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary not to do that, didn't you?
6255832	eng	Tom said he could probably do that.
6255833	eng	How often do you play basketball?
6255834	eng	You knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that, didn't you?
6255835	eng	Tom said I should be there by 2:30.
6255836	eng	How many girls are in your class?
6255837	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that if Mary hadn't told him to.
6255838	eng	Tom said I had to be there by 2:30.
6255839	eng	How long will it take to do that?
6255840	eng	Tom would've never done that if Mary hadn't been there.
6255841	eng	Tom said I didn't sound optimistic.
6255842	eng	How long does it take to do that?
6255843	eng	Tom would've been late if Mary hadn't given him a ride.
6255844	eng	Tom runs the business with his son.
6255845	eng	How far is the station from here?
6255846	eng	Tom won't likely be any faster at doing that than Mary.
6255847	eng	Tom rubbed his eyes with his hands.
6255848	eng	How do you usually get to Boston?
6255849	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to look out the window.
6255850	eng	Tom refused the food I offered him.
6255851	eng	How did you learn how to do that?
6255852	eng	Tom will likely be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6255853	eng	Tom recommended that I not do that.
6255854	eng	Have you ever owned a motorcycle?
6255855	eng	Tom wasn't the one who advised Mary to stop doing that.
6255856	eng	Tom recently earned his law degree.
6255857	eng	Even I don't know how to do that.
6255858	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he said he wouldn't do that.
6255859	eng	Tom received his doctorate in 2013.
6255860	eng	Even I can speak a little French.
6255861	eng	Tom told me yesterday that Mary would do that tomorrow.
6255862	eng	Tom really enjoyed being a teacher.
6255863	eng	Don't you want to come to Boston?
6255864	eng	Tom told Mary that he would have to do that by himself.
6255865	eng	Tom really doesn't want to do that.
6255866	eng	Don't try to do that by yourself.
6255867	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was too old for her.
6255868	eng	Tom really doesn't need to do that.
6255869	eng	Don't let them cut your hair off.
6255870	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was in the basement.
6255871	eng	Tom really doesn't have to do that.
6255872	eng	Don't forget to fill up the tank.
6255873	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was being sarcastic.
6255874	eng	Tom rarely gives his wife presents.
6255875	eng	Don't forget to check your tires.
6255876	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was prejudiced.
6255877	eng	Tom ran out of gas on his way here.
6255878	eng	Doing that would probably be fun.
6255879	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was aggressive.
6255880	eng	Tom quit school for health reasons.
6255881	eng	Doing that would be a lot of fun.
6255882	eng	Tom told Mary it would be dangerous for her to do that.
6255883	eng	Tom put the tray down on the table.
6255884	eng	Doing that will probably be easy.
6255885	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be gone by the time we get there.
6255886	eng	Tom put the book down on the table.
6255887	eng	Doing that should be very simple.
6255888	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be drunk by the time he gets home.
6255889	eng	Tom pronounces my name incorrectly.
6255890	eng	Doing that probably won't be fun.
6255891	eng	Tom still has no idea why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6255892	eng	Tom promised to go get that for me.
6255893	eng	Doing that doesn't make me happy.
6255894	eng	Tom started jokingly referring to Mary as his fiancée.
6255895	eng	Tom promised me he'd clean my room.
6255896	eng	Do you think you get paid enough?
6255897	eng	Tom shoved the letter he got from Mary into his pocket.
6255898	eng	Tom promised he'd do that tomorrow.
6255899	eng	Do you think we can do that here?
6255900	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that without Mary's permission.
6255901	eng	Tom promised he won't do that here.
6255902	eng	Do you think it's fun to do that?
6255903	eng	Tom should've been able to do that without Mary's help.
6255904	eng	Tom probably won't need to do that.
6255905	eng	Do you think it'll snow tomorrow?
6255906	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she needs to be more careful.
6255907	eng	Tom probably won't have to do that.
6255908	eng	Do you often buy lottery tickets?
6255909	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6255910	eng	Tom probably won't be back by 2:30.
6255911	eng	Do you need to go to Boston, too?
6255912	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he wants to quit his job.
6255913	eng	Tom probably isn't married anymore.
6255914	eng	Do you know where you need to go?
6255915	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he's going to Boston.
6255916	eng	Tom practices the violin every day.
6255917	eng	Do you know how to keep a secret?
6255918	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he doesn't like John.
6255919	eng	Tom plays the saxophone quite well.
6255920	eng	Do you know how to change a tire?
6255921	eng	Tom seemed to be aware that Mary didn't want him there.
6255922	eng	Tom plays the drums and also sings.
6255923	eng	Do you know anyone who does that?
6255924	eng	Tom says he knows Mary will have to do that on her own.
6255925	eng	Tom plans to do better from now on.
6255926	eng	Do you always do that on Mondays?
6255927	eng	Tom says he knows Mary will eventually want to do that.
6255928	eng	Tom plans to attend medical school.
6255929	eng	Do we really have to do that now?
6255930	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary will be able to do that by herself.
6255931	eng	Tom passed away in October of 2013.
6255932	eng	Do any of your friends have pets?
6255933	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows when she ought to do that.
6255934	eng	Tom only does that when he's drunk.
6255935	eng	Didn't you know I had to do that?
6255936	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows when she needs to do that.
6255937	eng	Tom often lets me use his computer.
6255938	eng	Did you do that without any help?
6255939	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that.
6255940	eng	Tom often forgets to lock the door.
6255941	eng	Could you explain it to me again?

6255944	eng	Carrots grow extremely well here.
6255945	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary ought to have done that.
6255946	eng	Tom never should've gone to Boston.
6255947	eng	Both of us don't want to do that.
6255948	eng	Tom says he doesn't care whether Mary does that or not.
6255949	eng	Tom never should've come to Boston.
6255950	eng	Are you still willing to do that?
6255951	eng	Tom says he and Mary almost always eat dinner together.
6255952	eng	Tom never seems to do that anymore.
6255953	eng	Are you still obliged to do that?
6255954	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John did that by himself.
6255955	eng	Tom never said what you say he did.
6255956	eng	Are you still be able to do that?
6255957	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary was a good-looking woman.

6255959	eng	Are you still allowed to do that?
6255960	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to leave tomorrow morning.

6255974	eng	Are you determined to do that?
6255975	eng	Tom said he's glad Mary has gotten out of the hospital.
6255976	eng	Tom needs to study a little harder.
6255977	eng	Are we permitted to do that here?
6255978	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't permitted Mary to do that.

6255989	eng	You've always been very helpful.
6255990	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to do that today.
6255991	eng	Tom must've been afraid to do that.
6255992	eng	You're too young to drive a car.
6255993	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to be here today.
6255994	eng	Tom might not go to Boston with us.
6255995	eng	You're to blame for all of this.
6255996	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be permitted to do that.
6255997	eng	Tom might go to Boston next spring.
6255998	eng	You're the tallest woman I know.
6255999	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary wouldn't be able to do that.
6256000	eng	Tom might come to Boston next week.
6256001	eng	You're the richest woman I know.
6256002	eng	Tom said he knew Mary was having a good time in Boston.
6256003	eng	Tom may realize later what I meant.
6256004	eng	You're the perfect woman for me.
6256005	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might want to do that by herself.
6256006	eng	Tom may even have to do that again.
6256007	eng	You're good at finding bargains.
6256008	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be required to do that.
6256009	eng	Tom may come to Boston next summer.
6256010	eng	You're a very good banjo player.
6256011	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might need to do that by herself.
6256012	eng	Tom may be excused from doing that.
6256013	eng	You're a tour guide, aren't you?
6256014	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might have to do that by herself.
6256015	eng	Tom made vegetable soup for dinner.
6256016	eng	You're a teetotaler, aren't you?
6256017	eng	Tom said he hopes Mary will help him with his homework.
6256018	eng	Tom made the most of his free time.
6256019	eng	You're a talented guitar player.
6256020	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wants to do that.
6256021	eng	Tom lost his job at the university.
6256022	eng	You're a strong guy, aren't you?
6256023	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needs to do that.
6256024	eng	Tom looks better with shorter hair.
6256025	eng	You're a lot stronger than I am.
6256026	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to have done that.
6256027	eng	Tom looked me straight in the eyes.
6256028	eng	You're a good-looking young man.
6256029	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to do that inside.
6256030	eng	Tom looked for the key to the door.
6256031	eng	You're a good volleyball player.
6256032	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary bought her bicycle.
6256033	eng	Tom looked around the waiting room.
6256034	eng	You're a good skier, aren't you?
6256035	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help Mary with her homework.
6256036	eng	Tom likes to get his picture taken.
6256037	eng	You're a good basketball player.
6256038	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that without Mary's help.
6256039	eng	Tom likely doesn't know where I am.
6256040	eng	You're a biochemist, aren't you?
6256041	eng	Tom said he didn't understand what Mary said in French.
6256042	eng	Tom left the room and went outside.
6256043	eng	You'll understand it eventually.
6256044	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that on purpose.
6256045	eng	Tom left his umbrella at our place.
6256046	eng	You'll still do that, won't you?
6256047	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really wanted to do that.
6256048	eng	Tom left Australia three years ago.
6256049	eng	You'll never be able to do that.
6256050	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really needed to do that.
6256051	eng	Tom learned French incredibly fast.
6256052	eng	You'll need a permit to do that.
6256053	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6256054	eng	Tom lay still with his eyes closed.
6256055	eng	You'll have to do that tomorrow.
6256056	eng	Tom said Mary's spaghetti is the best he's ever tasted.
6256057	eng	Tom knows very little about sports.
6256058	eng	You'll have a chance to do that.
6256059	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't at home when he went to visit her.
6256060	eng	Tom knows very little about Boston.
6256061	eng	You'll get fired if you do that.
6256062	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help John do that today.
6256063	eng	Tom knows there's still work to do.
6256064	eng	You'll do that today, won't you?
6256065	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who was able to do that.
6256066	eng	Tom knows how to speak to children.
6256067	eng	You'll do that later, won't you?
6256068	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who knew how to do that.
6256069	eng	Tom knows he's supposed to do that.
6256070	eng	You'll do that alone, won't you?
6256071	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be afraid to do that.
6256072	eng	Tom knows he's got to keep working.
6256073	eng	You'll do that again, won't you?
6256074	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be the next one to do that.
6256075	eng	Tom knows he needs to study French.
6256076	eng	You'd better do that in a hurry.
6256077	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be the last one to do that.
6256078	eng	Tom knows he made the right choice.
6256079	eng	You'd be stupid if you did that.
6256080	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be forgiven for doing that.
6256081	eng	Tom knows hardly anything about it.
6256082	eng	You'd be foolish not to do that.
6256083	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be excused from doing that.
6256084	eng	Tom knew he didn't have to do that.
6256085	eng	You won't do that now, will you?
6256086	eng	Tom said Mary was having a really hard time doing that.
6256087	eng	Tom knew I was supposed to do that.
6256088	eng	You won't be allowed to do that.
6256089	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be required to do that.
6256090	eng	Tom kept me waiting for 30 minutes.
6256091	eng	You woke us up again last night.
6256092	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be permitted to do that.
6256093	eng	Tom kept me from joining the group.
6256094	eng	You were surprised, weren't you?
6256095	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might be allowed to do that.
6256096	eng	Tom just told me he wasn't at home.
6256097	eng	You were a soldier, weren't you?
6256098	eng	Tom said Mary should've asked John to help her do that.
6256099	eng	Tom just stood there looking at me.
6256100	eng	You usually do that by yourself.
6256101	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
6256102	eng	Tom isn't willing to do that again.
6256103	eng	You told us you'd do that again.
6256104	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that.
6256105	eng	Tom isn't very likely to be asleep.
6256106	eng	You told us we couldn't do that.
6256107	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might want to do that by himself.
6256108	eng	Tom isn't the only one who's tired.
6256109	eng	You still don't do that, do you?
6256110	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that inside.
6256111	eng	Tom isn't sure what the problem is.
6256112	eng	You shouldn't raise your prices.
6256113	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be required to do that.
6256114	eng	Tom isn't sure he wants to do that.
6256115	eng	You should've done that with us.
6256116	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might need to do that by himself.
6256117	eng	Tom isn't sure he ought to do that.
6256118	eng	You should go ahead and do that.
6256119	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might have to do that by himself.
6256120	eng	Tom isn't sure he needs to do that.
6256121	eng	You sell coffee here, don't you?
6256122	eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John wants to do that.
6256123	eng	Tom isn't supposed to be in Boston.
6256124	eng	You seem to know how to do that.
6256125	eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John needs to do that.
6256126	eng	Tom isn't living in Boston anymore.
6256127	eng	You seem to be a strong swimmer.
6256128	eng	Tom said Mary is the one responsible for what happened.
6256129	eng	Tom isn't likely to be sleepy.
6256130	eng	You said you enjoyed doing that.
6256131	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that tomorrow.
6256132	eng	Tom isn't likely to be scared.
6256133	eng	You promised to help us do that.
6256134	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that to Alice.
6256135	eng	Tom isn't likely to be lonely.
6256136	eng	You promised that you'd do that.
6256137	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
6256138	eng	Tom isn't likely to be afraid.
6256139	eng	You probably did that last year.
6256140	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John would do that to Alice.
6256141	eng	Tom isn't interested in doing that.
6256142	eng	You need to finish this by 2:30.
6256143	eng	Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary to do that.
6256144	eng	Tom isn't as rich as he says he is.
6256145	eng	You need to do that by yourself.
6256146	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wasn't at his party.
6256147	eng	Tom is willing to do that for free.
6256148	eng	You need to consider doing that.
6256149	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary was in the hospital.
6256150	eng	Tom is willing to buy that for you.
6256151	eng	You must've done that last year.
6256152	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wants me to do that.
6256153	eng	Tom is very sure he should do that.
6256154	eng	You may get hurt if you do that.
6256155	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is tired or not.
6256156	eng	Tom is very sure he has to do that.
6256157	eng	You may do whatever you want to.
6256158	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary can swim or not.
6256159	eng	Tom is unable to refuse to do that.
6256160	eng	You look like you're having fun.
6256161	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary thinks he's stupid.
6256162	eng	Tom is too out of shape to do that.
6256163	eng	You look like you might be sick.
6256164	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary has a crush on him.
6256165	eng	Tom is too generous with his money.
6256166	eng	You look like a friendly person.
6256167	eng	Tom is the only one who seems to know why Mary is here.
6256168	eng	Tom is the strongest person I know.
6256169	eng	You look funny wearing that hat.
6256170	eng	Tom has already told Mary to be there tomorrow at 2:30.
6256171	eng	Tom is the only person for the job.
6256172	eng	You look about thirty years old.
6256173	eng	Tom got a book down from the shelf and gave it to Mary.
6256174	eng	Tom is the only person I can trust.
6256175	eng	You look a lot like your mother.
6256176	eng	Tom doesn't want to know why Mary doesn't want to that.
6256177	eng	Tom is the only one who'll do that.
6256178	eng	You know you can't do that here.
6256179	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be the next one to do that.
6256180	eng	Tom is the one that has to do that.
6256181	eng	You helped us do that last year.
6256182	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be the last one to do that.
6256183	eng	Tom is the new third grade teacher.
6256184	eng	You have to do that by yourself.
6256185	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be in her office on Monday.
6256186	eng	Tom is the first boy I ever kissed.
6256187	eng	You have to consider doing that.
6256188	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be awake when he gets home.
6256189	eng	Tom is the author of several books.
6256190	eng	You enjoy doing that, don't you?
6256191	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary has any intention of doing that.
6256192	eng	Tom is supposed to stop doing that.
6256193	eng	You don't still do that, do you?
6256194	eng	Tom doesn't seem convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
6256195	eng	Tom is studying at this university.
6256196	eng	You don't seem to enjoy jogging.
6256197	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him to help her.
6256198	eng	Tom is still waiting for his check.
6256199	eng	You don't often do that, do you?
6256200	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is good at French or not.
6256201	eng	Tom is still unpacking his clothes.
6256202	eng	You don't need to come tomorrow.
6256203	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary wasn't the one who did that.
6256204	eng	Tom is still determined to do that.
6256205	eng	You don't look like you're sick.
6256206	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't know how to do that.
6256207	eng	Tom is still alive, I'm sure of it.
6256208	eng	You don't look like you're done.
6256209	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that by herself.
6256210	eng	Tom is someone who speaks his mind.
6256211	eng	You don't look like you're busy.
6256212	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be the last one to do that.
6256213	eng	Tom is someone we all looked up to.
6256214	eng	You did that exceptionally well.
6256215	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary hadn't done that.
6256216	eng	Tom is slated to return in October.
6256217	eng	You couldn't do that, could you?
6256218	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was good at skiing or not.
6256219	eng	Tom is shivering because it's cold.
6256220	eng	You could've done that yourself.
6256221	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was good at French or not.
6256222	eng	Tom is rereading his favorite book.
6256223	eng	You appear unwilling to do that.
6256224	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary could speak French or not.
6256225	eng	Tom is reluctant to try to do that.
6256226	eng	You almost did that, didn't you?
6256227	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was going to make for dinner.
6256228	eng	Tom is reluctant to do that for us.
6256229	eng	Would you please let me do that?
6256230	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to donate some money.
6256231	eng	Tom is quite likely doing that now.
6256232	eng	Would you please do that for me?
6256233	eng	Tom couldn't wait to tell Mary about what had happened.
6256234	eng	Tom is quite a guitarist, you know.
6256235	eng	Would you open the gate, please?
6256236	eng	Tom broke up with Mary and has started going out Alice.
6256237	eng	Tom is probably off his meds again.
6256238	eng	Would you open the door, please?
6256239	eng	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that John wouldn't do that.
6256240	eng	Tom is probably not having any fun.
6256241	eng	Would you mind signing a waiver?
6256242	eng	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that John would kiss Alice.
6256243	eng	Tom is outside waiting in the rain.
6256244	eng	Would you mind doing that later?
6256245	eng	Tom asked Mary why she thought she needed to help John.
6256246	eng	Tom is on a hike with some friends.
6256247	eng	Would you lock the gate, please?
6256248	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't come to school yesterday.
6256249	eng	Tom is now learning how to do that.
6256250	eng	Would you lock the door, please?
6256251	eng	Tom asked Mary what time she wanted him to pick her up.
6256252	eng	Tom is never late for appointments.
6256253	eng	Would you be willing to do that?
6256254	eng	Tom asked Mary to help him decorate his Christmas tree.
6256255	eng	Tom is married to a Canadian woman.
6256256	eng	Won't you please let me do that?
6256257	eng	Tom asked Mary if she would mind doing that by herself.
6256258	eng	Tom is married and lives in Boston.
6256259	eng	Won't you please do that for me?
6256260	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really needed to do that anymore.
6256261	eng	Tom is majoring in music education.
6256262	eng	Will you teach French next year?
6256263	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really had to do that by herself.
6256264	eng	Tom is lucky he didn't get injured.
6256265	eng	Will you study French next year?
6256266	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John wanted to do that.
6256267	eng	Tom is lucky he can still stand up.
6256268	eng	Will you please pass the butter?
6256269	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John needed to do that.
6256270	eng	Tom is likely to still be confused.
6256271	eng	Will you please open the window?
6256272	eng	Tom and I were able to help Mary do what she had to do.
6256273	eng	Tom is likely to regret doing that.
6256274	eng	Will you meet us at the airport?
6256275	eng	Tom and I both fell in love with Mary at the same time.
6256276	eng	Tom is likely to refuse to do that.
6256277	eng	Will you be in Boston on Monday?
6256278	eng	Tom advised Mary to come back home as soon as possible.
6256279	eng	Tom is likely to be retired by now.
6256280	eng	Will you be doing that tomorrow?
6256281	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me what Mary had done.
6256282	eng	Tom is likely to be home on Monday.
6256283	eng	Will we be permitted to do that?
6256284	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be better at doing that than Mary.
6256285	eng	Tom is likely to be doing that now.
6256286	eng	Why would I be afraid of anyone?
6256287	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be as frightened as Mary would be.
6256288	eng	Tom is likely doing that right now.
6256289	eng	Why were you left alone at home?
6256290	eng	I think Tom would be better at doing that than Mary is.
6256292	eng	Why don't you want to buy a car?
6256293	eng	I think Tom will be able to help Mary do that tomorrow.
6256294	eng	Tom is leaving Boston this morning.
6256295	eng	Why do you need to go to Boston?
6256296	eng	I think Tom could probably talk Mary out of doing that.
6256297	eng	Tom is learning to ride a tricycle.
6256298	eng	Why do you need another bicycle?
6256299	eng	I think I heard Tom say that Mary was going to do that.
6256300	eng	Tom is learning how to do that now.
6256301	eng	Why do you have to go to Boston?
6256302	eng	I doubt if Tom will be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6256303	eng	Tom is in the garden pulling weeds.
6256304	eng	Why do I need to be there early?
6256305	eng	I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
6256306	eng	Tom is immensely popular on campus.
6256307	eng	Why did you not want to do that?
6256308	eng	I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary needs to do.
6256309	eng	Tom is having a hard time speaking.
6256310	eng	Why aren't you wearing a jacket?
6256311	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to Boston with Mary?
6256312	eng	Tom is happiest when he's swimming.
6256313	eng	Why aren't you going to do that?
6256314	eng	Did you know that Tom thought that John was Mary's son?
6256315	eng	Tom is going to be very successful.
6256316	eng	Who told you you had to do that?
6256317	eng	You didn't know Tom had to help Mary do that, did you?
6256318	eng	Tom is giving us what we asked for.
6256319	eng	Who told you I wouldn't do that?
6256320	eng	Tom would've done that for Mary if he'd had more time.
6256321	eng	Tom is feeling stronger these days.
6256322	eng	Who told you I couldn't do that?
6256323	eng	Tom would never have done that if Mary had been there.
6256324	eng	Tom is feeling a little bit better.
6256325	eng	Who do you usually do that with?
6256326	eng	Tom would be very disappointed if Mary didn't do that.
6256327	eng	Tom is doing his best to stay calm.
6256328	eng	Who do you think we should hire?
6256329	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he doesn't want to do that.
6256330	eng	Tom is disabled and unable to work.
6256331	eng	Who asked you to come to Boston?
6256332	eng	Tom won't likely forget to tell Mary he won't do that.
6256333	eng	Tom is determined to get that done.
6256334	eng	Which store did you buy that at?
6256335	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he wants her to help John.
6256336	eng	Tom is determined to do that today.
6256337	eng	Where did you put the newspaper?
6256338	eng	Tom was sure Mary knew she wasn't supposed to do that.
6256339	eng	Tom is determined to do that again.
6256340	eng	Where can I buy some toothpaste?
6256341	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he said he didn't love her.
6256342	eng	Tom is currently working in Boston.
6256343	eng	When will you go to Boston next?
6256344	eng	Tom told me that he's quicker at doing that than Mary.
6256345	eng	Tom is coming to Boston next month.
6256346	eng	What's your French teacher like?
6256347	eng	Tom told Mary that she should make herself a sandwich.
6256348	eng	Tom is close to making that happen.
6256349	eng	What's that building over there?
6256350	eng	Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be hesitant to do that.
6256351	eng	Tom is busy and can't help you now.
6256352	eng	What time does the library open?
6256353	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John would be back soon.
6256354	eng	Tom is both rich and very generous.
6256355	eng	What kind of sports do you like?
6256356	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't intelligent.
6256357	eng	Tom is boiling eggs in the kitchen.
6256358	eng	What kind of people do you like?
6256359	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was self-conscious.
6256360	eng	Tom is better today than yesterday.
6256361	eng	What kind of exercise do you do?
6256362	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was impatient.
6256363	eng	Tom is better off than ever before.
6256364	eng	What exactly do you want to buy?
6256365	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was dishonest.
6256366	eng	Tom is always using his smartphone.
6256367	eng	What did that sound like to you?
6256368	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was depressed.
6256369	eng	Tom is also not a very good singer.
6256370	eng	Were you really able to do that?
6256371	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was dangerous.
6256372	eng	Tom is already in Boston, isn't he?
6256373	eng	We've all done that a few times.
6256374	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was conceited.
6256375	eng	Tom is almost never home on Monday.
6256376	eng	We'll be in Boston next weekend.
6256377	eng	Tom told Mary not to do that, but she did that anyway.
6256378	eng	Tom is allowed to do what he wants.
6256379	eng	We won't go to Boston next week.
6256380	eng	Tom thought Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6256381	eng	Tom is afraid to swim in this lake.
6256382	eng	We weren't married at that time.
6256383	eng	Tom thought Mary would be drunk, but she seemed sober.
6256384	eng	Tom is afraid to refuse to do that.
6256385	eng	We watched a movie about aliens.
6256386	eng	Tom thought Mary would be difficult to get along with.
6256387	eng	Tom is a man who likes a challenge.
6256388	eng	We stood at the end of the line.
6256389	eng	Tom thought Mary was glad that that's going to happen.
6256390	eng	Tom is a lot like I was at his age.
6256391	eng	We should've left Boston sooner.
6256392	eng	Tom thinks that Mary isn't the one who should do that.
6256393	eng	Tom is a former family court judge.
6256394	eng	We should go to Boston together.
6256395	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be gone by the time we get there.
6256396	eng	Tom is a fairly good backup singer.
6256397	eng	We seldom see ducks around here.
6256398	eng	Tom should've told Mary not to go to Boston with John.
6256399	eng	Tom is a doctor like his father is.
6256400	eng	We never see wolves around here.
6256401	eng	Tom should've been grateful for what Mary did for him.
6256402	eng	Tom is a disabled military veteran.
6256403	eng	We might study French next year.
6256404	eng	Tom should tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that.
6256405	eng	Tom is a coward and always will be.
6256406	eng	We may be in Boston next winter.
6256407	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6256408	eng	Tom is a better man than I thought.
6256409	eng	We have to pay these bills soon.
6256410	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what he needs her to do.
6256411	eng	Tom intends to come back to Boston.
6256412	eng	We don't work in Boston anymore.
6256413	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that she has to do that.
6256414	eng	Tom insisted on my paying the bill.
6256415	eng	We did some shopping on the way.
6256416	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary what he wants to do.
6256417	eng	Tom insisted on finishing the game.
6256418	eng	We can't live in Boston anymore.
6256419	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary what he needs to do.
6256420	eng	Tom injured his elbow when he fell.
6256421	eng	We can't go to Boston this week.
6256422	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he wants to do that.
6256423	eng	Tom inherited his uncle's property.
6256424	eng	We can do that here if you want.
6256425	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he doesn't like her.
6256426	eng	Tom hurt himself trying to do that.
6256427	eng	Was it you who broke the window?
6256428	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary about what happened.
6256429	eng	Tom hurried so he wouldn't be late.
6256430	eng	Today's a good day for a picnic.
6256431	eng	Tom seemed surprised that Mary wasn't able to do that.
6256432	eng	Tom hung up without saying goodbye.
6256433	eng	Three of my toes were amputated.
6256434	eng	Tom seemed surprised that Mary didn't know what to do.
6256435	eng	Tom hitched the trailer to his car.
6256436	eng	This time of year is always hot.
6256437	eng	Tom says he wants to apologize to Mary for doing that.
6256438	eng	Tom hasn't told me why he did that.
6256439	eng	This is a good place to do that.
6256440	eng	Tom says he knows Mary will have to help John do that.
6256441	eng	Tom hasn't lost a match all season.
6256442	eng	This is a book I'd like to read.
6256443	eng	Tom says he knows Mary will have to do that next week.
6256444	eng	Tom hasn't given any other details.
6256445	eng	They want to know what happened.
6256446	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows why she needs to do that.
6256447	eng	Tom hasn't dropped out of the race.
6256448	eng	They say it gets very cold here.
6256449	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary is willing to do that with him.
6256450	eng	Tom hasn't done that since October.
6256451	eng	There's no easy way out of here.
6256452	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't say she has to do that.
6256453	eng	Tom hasn't done that in three days.
6256454	eng	The two of us did that together.
6256455	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let John do that.
6256456	eng	Tom hasn't been to Boston in years.
6256457	eng	The road up ahead is washed out.
6256458	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary doesn't like Boston.
6256459	eng	Tom hasn't been seen since October.
6256460	eng	The mosquitoes didn't bother me.
6256461	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary would really do that.
6256462	eng	Tom hasn't been named as a suspect.
6256463	eng	That'll likely happen next week.
6256464	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't want to do that.
6256465	eng	Tom hasn't been here since October.
6256466	eng	That would really make me happy.
6256467	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't need to do that.
6256468	eng	Tom hasn't asked even one question.
6256469	eng	That water is not safe to drink.
6256470	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't have to do that.
6256471	eng	Tom hasn't asked a single question.
6256472	eng	That was easier than I expected.
6256473	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't do that on time.
6256474	eng	Tom hasn't actually ever done that.
6256475	eng	That plan never would've worked.
6256476	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would eventually do that.
6256477	eng	Tom hasn't actually been to Boston.
6256478	eng	That doesn't seem to bother you.
6256479	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wanted to move to Boston.
6256480	eng	Tom has won the trophy three times.
6256481	eng	Shouldn't you be doing that now?
6256482	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary had to help John do that.
6256483	eng	Tom has told me I ought to do that.
6256484	eng	Sales have increased 30 percent.
6256485	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary could do that by herself.
6256486	eng	Tom has to be the one who did that.
6256487	eng	Please try not to do that again.
6256488	eng	Tom says he and Mary sometimes go to the zoo together.
6256489	eng	Tom has spent some time doing that.
6256490	eng	Please tell me how you did that.
6256491	eng	Tom says he and Mary almost never take walks together.
6256492	eng	Tom has some very talented friends.
6256493	eng	Please show me how you did that.
6256494	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John would do that to you.
6256495	eng	Tom has some experience doing that.
6256496	eng	Please don't be late for dinner.
6256497	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John did that yesterday.
6256498	eng	Tom has so much to look forward to.
6256499	eng	Please do that today if you can.
6256500	eng	Tom said that Mary would do that as soon as she could.
6256501	eng	Tom has since moved back to Boston.
6256502	eng	Please do that anytime you like.
6256503	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't working as waitress anymore.
6256504	eng	Tom has said he intends to do that.
6256505	eng	Park Street needs to be repaved.
6256506	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't going to do that by herself.
6256507	eng	Tom has run some really good races.
6256508	eng	Our troubles are only beginning.
6256509	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that wouldn't be fun.
6256510	eng	Tom has released three solo albums.
6256511	eng	Our luck will eventually change.
6256512	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that would be boring.
6256513	eng	Tom has read that book three times.
6256514	eng	Our demands aren't unreasonable.
6256515	eng	Tom said that Mary should do that as soon as possible.
6256516	eng	Tom has proven us wrong many times.
6256518	eng	Tom said that Mary really wanted to do that with John.
6256519	eng	Tom has promised to do that for us.
6256520	eng	No one pays any attention to me.
6256521	eng	Tom said that Mary has been very happy here in Boston.
6256522	eng	Tom has probably gone home already.
6256523	eng	Neither of us wanted to do that.
6256524	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be enjoying herself.
6256525	eng	Tom has plenty of his own problems.
6256526	eng	My suitcase is still in my room.
6256527	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why Mary wanted to do that.
6256528	eng	Tom has played a lot of basketball.
6256529	eng	My shoes don't fit me very well.
6256530	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why Mary needed to do that.
6256531	eng	Tom has no trouble speaking French.
6256532	eng	My project won the science fair.
6256533	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't gone to Boston with Mary.
6256534	eng	Tom has no choice but to surrender.
6256535	eng	My plan saved us a lot of money.
6256536	eng	Tom said he wanted to give Mary the chance to do that.
6256537	eng	Tom has never taught French before.
6256538	eng	My phone rang, but I ignored it.
6256539	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to help Mary do that.
6256540	eng	Tom has never done that by himself.
6256541	eng	My patience has finally run out.
6256542	eng	Tom said he thought he would be able to cheer Mary up.
6256543	eng	Tom has never attempted to do that.
6256544	eng	My parents are older than yours.
6256545	eng	Tom said he thought Mary's suggestion was a good idea.
6256546	eng	Tom has never asked me to help him.
6256547	eng	My parents are both from Boston.
6256548	eng	Tom said he thought Mary's punishment was appropriate.
6256549	eng	Tom has never asked for my support.
6256550	eng	My mother bought me a new skirt.
6256551	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be required to do that.
6256552	eng	Tom has made some very bad choices.
6256553	eng	My last year in Boston was 2013.
6256554	eng	Tom said he saw Mary waiting for the bus this morning.
6256555	eng	Tom has made his share of mistakes.
6256556	eng	My injuries aren't very serious.
6256557	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not be allowed to do that.
6256558	eng	Tom has lived in Boston ever since.
6256559	eng	My grades haven't improved much.
6256560	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might have to do that this week.
6256561	eng	Tom has led a pretty exciting life.
6256562	eng	My friends tried to cheer me up.
6256563	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to do that today.
6256564	eng	Tom has just had his teeth cleaned.
6256565	eng	My first day of work was Monday.
6256566	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that again.
6256567	eng	Tom has just been named head coach.
6256568	eng	My father died when I was three.
6256569	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary should do that outside.
6256570	eng	Tom has his good days and bad days.
6256571	eng	My car's parked just over there.
6256572	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary should do that anymore.
6256573	eng	Tom has had a very successful year.
6256574	eng	My business is doing quite well.
6256575	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to do that again.
6256576	eng	Tom has given me a lot of guidance.
6256577	eng	My brothers are still in Boston.
6256578	eng	Tom said he didn't want me to tell Mary what happened.
6256579	eng	Tom has finally learned to do that.
6256580	eng	My bicycle was stolen yesterday.
6256581	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary ought to have done that.
6256582	eng	Tom has finally decided to do that.
6256583	eng	My band will be playing tonight.
6256584	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to do that again.
6256585	eng	Tom has experience teaching French.
6256586	eng	My apartment has three bedrooms.
6256587	eng	Tom said Mary was too young to get a driver's license.
6256588	eng	Tom has even traveled to Australia.
6256589	eng	Monday will likely be a hot day.
6256590	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help you do that today.
6256591	eng	Tom has enough problems of his own.
6256592	eng	Let's do that together sometime.
6256593	eng	Tom said Mary was too old to go out dancing all night.
6256594	eng	Tom has done that more than I have.
6256595	eng	Let's do that as much as we can.
6256596	eng	Tom said Mary was too busy to help John do that today.
6256597	eng	Tom has done that again, hasn't he?
6256598	eng	It's tomorrow that I'll do that.
6256599	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that.
6256600	eng	Tom has definitely been very lucky.
6256601	eng	It's probably OK not to do that.
6256602	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that.
6256603	eng	Tom has decided to stop doing that.
6256604	eng	It's no use doing that tomorrow.
6256605	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John about what happened.
6256607	eng	It's little too late to do that.
6256608	eng	Tom said Mary should've asked John to do that for her.
6256609	eng	Tom has decided to keep doing that.
6256610	eng	It's an excellent idea, I think.
6256611	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not be allowed to do that.
6256612	eng	Tom has decided to do that instead.
6256613	eng	It'll be interesting to do that.
6256614	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be permitted to do that.
6256615	eng	Tom has decided that he'll do that.
6256616	eng	It would be wise not to do that.
6256617	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still determined to do that.
6256618	eng	Tom has decided against doing that.
6256619	eng	It would be rude to do that now.
6256620	eng	Tom said Mary hasn't yet been punished for doing that.
6256621	eng	Tom has been trying to help me out.
6256622	eng	It would be romantic to do that.
6256623	eng	Tom said Mary has been having fun hanging out with us.
6256624	eng	Tom has been to all of my concerts.
6256625	eng	It would be possible to do that.
6256626	eng	Tom said Mary has always been pretty good at swimming.
6256627	eng	Tom has been struggling to do that.
6256628	eng	It wasn't hot in Boston, was it?
6256629	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to do this morning.
6256630	eng	Tom has been singing all afternoon.
6256631	eng	It takes a long time to do that.
6256632	eng	Tom probably won't be able to do that as well as Mary.
6256633	eng	Tom has been sick since last night.
6256634	eng	It looks like you want to leave.
6256635	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is in the hospital.
6256636	eng	Tom has been nominated three times.
6256637	eng	It doesn't look like you're mad.
6256638	eng	Tom probably doesn't know whether Mary is busy or not.
6256639	eng	Tom has been moved to another cell.
6256640	eng	Is there any peanut butter left?
6256641	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary bought her dress.
6256642	eng	Tom has been learning how to drive.
6256643	eng	Is there a safer way to do that?
6256644	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what Mary expects him to do.
6256645	eng	Tom has been in jail several times.
6256646	eng	Is it dangerous to do that here?
6256647	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary shouldn't do that.
6256648	eng	Tom has been fired from three jobs.
6256649	eng	If you're hungry, eat something.
6256650	eng	Tom probably doesn't know if Mary will do that or not.
6256651	eng	Tom has been doing that since 2013.
6256652	eng	If you want to do that, you may.
6256653	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how Mary managed to do that.
6256654	eng	Tom has been diagnosed with cancer.
6256655	eng	I'm sure that Tom would be willing to do that for you.
6256656	eng	Tom isn't positive that Mary was the one who did that.
6256657	eng	Tom has been caught cheating again.
6256658	eng	I've spent some time doing that.
6256659	eng	Tom is lucky that Mary is still be willing to do that.
6256660	eng	Tom has been beaten up three times.
6256661	eng	I've read that book three times.
6256662	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that until he gets there.
6256663	eng	Tom has been accused of doing that.
6256664	eng	I've only tried doing that once.
6256665	eng	Tom gave Mary detailed instructions on how to do that.
6256666	eng	Tom has been a really good manager.
6256667	eng	I've only done that three times.
6256668	eng	Tom doesn't think there is any way Mary could do that.
6256669	eng	Tom has been a fugitive since 2013.
6256670	eng	I've just bought a new computer.
6256671	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be glad if that happened.
6256672	eng	Tom has apparently been doing that.
6256673	eng	I've had lots of fun doing that.
6256674	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be through doing that yet.
6256675	eng	Tom has always been taller than me.
6256676	eng	I've given up trying to do that.
6256677	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be at home this afternoon.
6256678	eng	Tom has always been faster than me.
6256679	eng	I've finally managed to do that.
6256680	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is difficult to get along with.
6256681	eng	Tom has always been a great player.
6256682	eng	I've been waiting for some time.
6256683	eng	Tom doesn't seem convinced that Mary wants to do that.
6256684	eng	Tom has always been a great friend.
6256685	eng	I've been trying to lose weight.
6256686	eng	Tom doesn't seem convinced that Mary needs to do that.
6256687	eng	Tom has also said he won't do that.
6256689	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't want him to do that.
6256690	eng	Tom has also said he can't do that.
6256691	eng	I've always been good at sports.
6256692	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary didn't come to school today.
6256693	eng	Tom has almost finished doing that.
6256694	eng	I've already forgotten his name.
6256695	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary wants to do that or not.
6256696	eng	Tom has a wonderful sense of humor.
6256697	eng	I've already decided to do that.
6256698	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary needs to do that or not.
6256699	eng	Tom has a wife and three daughters.
6256700	eng	I'm willing to do that for free.
6256701	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is good at chess or not.
6256702	eng	Tom has a very good sense of humor.
6256703	eng	I'm willing to buy that for you.
6256704	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary can speak French or not.
6256705	eng	Tom has a piano lesson once a week.
6256706	eng	I'm very sure I need to do that.
6256707	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary isn't the one who did that.
6256708	eng	Tom has a great deal of experience.
6256709	eng	I'm usually too busy to do that.
6256710	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary would really want to do that.
6256711	eng	Tom has a good knowledge of French.
6256712	eng	I'm too young to go there alone.
6256713	eng	Tom didn't think it would be safe for Mary to do that.
6256714	eng	Tom has a daughter who's a teacher.
6256715	eng	I'm too out of shape to do that.
6256716	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be awake when he got home.
6256717	eng	Tom had to have open-heart surgery.
6256718	eng	I'm really glad I could do that.
6256719	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was going to be able to do that.
6256720	eng	Tom had to have open heart surgery.
6256721	eng	I'm probably not as rich as you.
6256722	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was difficult to get along with.
6256723	eng	Tom had to do a lot of apologizing.
6256724	eng	I'm not sure that's what I need.
6256725	eng	Tom didn't think Mary could do that without some help.
6256726	eng	Tom had no intention of doing that.
6256727	eng	I'm not ready to do that either.
6256728	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary had to do that.
6256729	eng	Tom had no choice but to surrender.
6256730	eng	I'm not finished doing that yet.
6256731	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary didn't do that.
6256732	eng	Tom had never kissed a girl before.
6256733	eng	I'm looking for a temporary job.
6256734	eng	Tom didn't seem convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
6256735	eng	Tom had his reasons for doing that.
6256736	eng	I'm hoping we can do that today.
6256737	eng	Tom didn't seem convinced that Mary needed to do that.
6256738	eng	Tom had his eyes checked last week.
6256739	eng	I'm hoping I can graduate early.
6256740	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was good at chess or not.
6256741	eng	Tom had butterflies in his stomach.
6256742	eng	I'm glad I was asked to do that.
6256743	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary wanted to do that or not.
6256744	eng	Tom had a very tough time adapting.
6256745	eng	I'm driving to Boston on Monday.
6256746	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary used to live on Park Street.
6256747	eng	Tom had a stunned look on his face.
6256748	eng	I'm certain that that'll happen.
6256749	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wasn't supposed to do that today.
6256750	eng	Tom had a good reason to celebrate.
6256751	eng	I'll try to do that before 2:30.
6256752	eng	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that she couldn't do that.
6256753	eng	Tom greeted his guests at the door.
6256754	eng	I'll be glad to do that for you.
6256755	eng	Tom asked if Mary really needed to do that by herself.
6256756	eng	Tom got up much earlier than usual.
6256757	eng	I'd rather watch something else.
6256758	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to go to Boston with him.
6256759	eng	Tom got there thirty minutes early.
6256760	eng	I'd prefer not to do that today.
6256761	eng	Tom and Mary played tennis together all day yesterday.
6256762	eng	Tom got the punishment he deserved.
6256763	eng	I'd like you to help me do that.
6256764	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other since kindergarten.
6256765	eng	Tom got into the car and drove off.
6256766	eng	I'd do that again if I were you.
6256767	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't agree on what they needed to do.
6256768	eng	Tom got hurt in the game yesterday.
6256769	eng	I'd be grateful if you did that.
6256770	eng	Tom and John are Mary's brothers. Alice is her sister.
6256771	eng	Tom got exactly what he wished for.
6256772	eng	I'd be glad to teach you French.
6256773	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what Mary said he had to do.
6256774	eng	Tom goes to a school for the blind.
6256775	eng	I'd be glad to buy that for you.
6256776	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary knows how to do that.
6256777	eng	Tom gets up at 6:30 in the morning.
6256778	eng	I wouldn't want to do that here.
6256779	eng	I'm sure Tom won't be able to do that as fast as Mary.
6256780	eng	Tom generally does that on Mondays.
6256781	eng	I wouldn't like to do that here.
6256782	eng	I think that Tom visited Boston with Mary last spring.
6256783	eng	Tom gave us quite a lot of trouble.
6256784	eng	I wouldn't be afraid to do that.
6256785	eng	I doubt if Tom will be faster at doing that than Mary.
6256786	eng	Tom gave us food when we needed it.
6256787	eng	I worked there for three months.
6256788	eng	I didn't know that Tom's house was so close to Mary's.
6256789	eng	Tom gave us exactly what we needed.
6256790	eng	I work for an insurance company.
6256791	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were married to each other.
6256792	eng	Tom gave me some very sound advice.
6256793	eng	I wonder who'll help us do that.
6256794	eng	I bet Tom would be able to tell you why Mary did that.
6256795	eng	Tom fumbled around in the darkness.
6256796	eng	I wonder who could've done that.
6256797	eng	Does Tom have a good relationship with Mary's parents?
6256798	eng	Tom found out what the problem was.
6256799	eng	I wonder if it's fun to do that.
6256800	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's grandparents?
6256801	eng	Tom forgot his umbrella on the bus.
6256802	eng	I won't show you how to do that.
6256803	eng	Did you know that Tom and Mary often do that together?
6256804	eng	Tom fixed the flat tire by himself.
6256805	eng	I won't have to do that anymore.
6256806	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't in the kitchen, cooking.
6256807	eng	Tom first did that three years ago.
6256808	eng	I won't go eat out this evening.
6256809	eng	Tom wondered if Mary still remembered how to do that.
6256810	eng	Tom finished doing that last month.
6256811	eng	I won't ever go to Boston again.
6256812	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary why he enjoyed doing that.
6256813	eng	Tom finished doing that by himself.
6256814	eng	I won't do that tomorrow either.
6256815	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he wants her to help John.
6256816	eng	Tom filled up the hole in the wall.
6256817	eng	I won't be doing that by myself.
6256818	eng	Tom won't likely be as excited about that as Mary is.
6256819	eng	Tom faces three charges of assault.
6256820	eng	I wish you would come to Boston.
6256821	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6256822	eng	Tom faces a possible life sentence.
6256823	eng	I wish we'd gone to Boston, too.
6256824	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he wants to quit his job.
6256825	eng	Tom expressed his thanks to us all.
6256826	eng	I wish we hadn't gone to Boston.
6256827	eng	Tom will probably be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6256828	eng	Tom eventually went back to Boston.
6256829	eng	I wish we hadn't come to Boston.
6256830	eng	Tom will likely be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6256831	eng	Tom enjoyed himself at the concert.
6256832	eng	I wish I'd never visited Boston.
6256833	eng	Tom wasn't able to answer Mary's technical questions.
6256834	eng	Tom ended up doing that last night.
6256835	eng	I wish I hadn't done what I did.
6256836	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he said he didn't do that.
6256837	eng	Tom ended up doing that by himself.
6256838	eng	I wish I had someone to talk to.
6256839	eng	Tom was able to do that with a little help from Mary.
6256840	eng	Tom earned his living as a teacher.
6256841	eng	I wish I didn't need to do that.
6256842	eng	Tom told me that I'm quicker at doing that than Mary.
6256843	eng	Tom earned his doctorate in Boston.
6256844	eng	I wish I could do that with you.
6256845	eng	Tom told Mary why it would be a good idea to do that.
6256846	eng	Tom drank the whole bottle of wine.
6256847	eng	I wish I could buy that for you.
6256848	eng	Tom told Mary which dress he thought she should wear.
6256849	eng	Tom said doing that wouldn't be any fun.
6256850	eng	I wasn't sure where I should go.
6256851	eng	Tom told Mary to come back home as soon as she could.
6256853	eng	I wasn't rich enough to do that.
6256854	eng	Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be willing to do that.
6256855	eng	Tom doesn't want us to do that now.
6256856	eng	I wasn't in any rush to do that.
6256857	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't prejudiced.
6256858	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that either.
6256859	eng	I wasn't hungry when I got home.
6256860	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't aggressive.
6256861	eng	Tom doesn't think we could do that.
6256862	eng	I was told to do that by myself.
6256863	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was overconfident.
6256864	eng	Tom doesn't think I should do that.
6256865	eng	I was told not to do that again.
6256866	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was in his office.
6256867	eng	Tom doesn't study French every day.
6256868	eng	I was thinking about doing that.
6256869	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had been arrested.
6256870	eng	Tom doesn't still do that, does he?
6256871	eng	I was the only one who did that.
6256872	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was mistaken.
6256873	eng	Tom doesn't speak French every day.
6256874	eng	I was in Boston again last week.
6256875	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was impolite.
6256876	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be very sleepy.
6256877	eng	I was happy to buy that for you.
6256878	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was handsome.
6256879	eng	Tom doesn't really want to do that.
6256880	eng	I was going to help you do that.
6256881	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was creative.
6256882	eng	Tom doesn't really need to do that.
6256883	eng	I was annoyed by the loud noise.
6256884	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was annoying.
6256885	eng	Tom doesn't really have to do that.
6256886	eng	I wanted you to help me do that.
6256887	eng	Tom told Mary that he couldn't permit her to do that.
6256888	eng	Tom doesn't realize what he's lost.
6256889	eng	I wanted to stay in Boston, too.
6256890	eng	Tom told Mary John couldn't do that without his help.
6256891	eng	Tom doesn't realize what he's done.
6256892	eng	I wanted to go outside and play.
6256893	eng	Tom thought Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
6256894	eng	Tom doesn't need any of this stuff.
6256895	eng	I wanted to go home early today.
6256896	eng	Tom thought Mary would be present at today's meeting.
6256897	eng	Tom doesn't look too worried to me.
6256898	eng	I wanted to go camping with you.
6256899	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be finished doing that by 2:30.
6256900	eng	Tom doesn't look like he's unhappy.
6256901	eng	I want to visit Boston sometime.
6256902	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be difficult to get along with.
6256903	eng	Tom doesn't listen to his teachers.
6256904	eng	I want to start my own business.
6256905	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be here for three or four hours.
6256906	eng	Tom doesn't like the way you dance.
6256907	eng	I want to learn to speak French.
6256908	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be exhausted when she gets home.
6256909	eng	Tom doesn't like the way I do that.
6256910	eng	I want to go to graduate school.
6256911	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that with John and him.
6256912	eng	Tom doesn't like spinach very much.
6256913	eng	I want to go to Boston sometime.
6256914	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that without Mary's approval.
6256915	eng	Tom doesn't like it when I do that.
6256916	eng	I want to finish what I'm doing.
6256917	eng	Tom should tell Mary about the job he's been offered.
6256918	eng	Tom doesn't know why that happened.
6256919	eng	I want to drink a cup of coffee.
6256920	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary why she should do that.
6256921	eng	Tom doesn't know a lot about music.
6256922	eng	I want to be at today's meeting.
6256923	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what she wants to know.
6256924	eng	Tom doesn't know a lot about birds.
6256925	eng	I want to be a helicopter pilot.
6256926	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he needs her help.
6256927	eng	Tom doesn't have very many options.
6256928	eng	I usually don't carry much cash.
6256929	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he won't do that again.
6256930	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that either.
6256931	eng	I turned off the overhead light.
6256932	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary to do that for him.
6256933	eng	Tom doesn't have time to get bored.
6256934	eng	I thought you didn't have a dog.
6256935	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary wanted to be alone.
6256936	eng	Tom doesn't have that many options.
6256937	eng	I thought you didn't have a car.
6256938	eng	Tom says he wants to give Mary the chance to do that.
6256939	eng	Tom doesn't have many weekends off.
6256940	eng	I thought it was fun doing that.
6256941	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary would really want to do that.
6256942	eng	Tom doesn't have any strength left.
6256943	eng	I think it would be fun to do that.
6256944	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary will be able to do that tomorrow.
6256945	eng	Tom doesn't have a high-paying job.
6256946	eng	I think that we have to do that.
6256947	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows when she should do that.
6256948	eng	Tom doesn't gamble, drink or smoke.
6256949	eng	I think it'll be worth the wait.
6256950	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows when she has to do that.
6256951	eng	Tom doesn't feel he has to do that.
6256952	eng	I think it'll be fun to do that.
6256953	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary is willing to do that for him.
6256954	eng	Tom doesn't even know that I exist.
6256955	eng	I think doing that would be fun.
6256956	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let you do that.
6256957	eng	Tom doesn't do that at all anymore.
6256958	eng	I think I'd be quiet doing that.
6256959	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let him do that.
6256960	eng	Tom doesn't do anything on Mondays.
6256961	eng	I think I'd be happy doing that.
6256962	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary will enjoy doing that.
6256963	eng	Tom doesn't believe you'll do that.
6256964	eng	I think I need to do that today.
6256965	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really has to do that.
6256966	eng	Tom doesn't believe he can do that.
6256967	eng	I think I don't have to do that.
6256968	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary really had to do that.
6256969	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be too tired.
6256970	eng	I think I can do that by myself.
6256971	eng	Tom says he doesn't know where Mary wants to do that.
6256972	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be too happy.
6256973	eng	I swear I won't do that anymore.
6256974	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what Mary is supposed to do.
6256975	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be surprised.
6256976	eng	I suggest that you visit Boston.
6256977	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would be at the meeting.
6256978	eng	Tom does whatever we ask him to do.
6256979	eng	I still haven't cleaned my room.
6256980	eng	Tom says he and Mary hardly ever go cycling together.
6256981	eng	Tom does whatever he's asked to do.
6256982	eng	I still do that once in a while.
6256983	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John did that by himself.
6256984	eng	Tom does that every day but Monday.
6256985	eng	I speak both French and English.
6256986	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John did that to Alice.
6256987	eng	Tom does that every Monday morning.
6256988	eng	I sometimes do things like that.
6256989	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John actually did that.
6256990	eng	Tom does that every Monday evening.
6256991	eng	I shouldn't have had to do that.
6256992	eng	Tom said that Mary said John wanted to do that today.
6256993	eng	Tom does take a walk every morning.
6256994	eng	I shouldn't have gone to Boston.
6256995	eng	Tom said that Mary really wanted to do that with you.
6256996	eng	Tom does nothing but eat and sleep.
6256997	eng	I shouldn't have come to Boston.
6256998	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't really know how to do that.
6256999	eng	Tom discovered how to open the box.
6257000	eng	I should've worn a heavier coat.
6257001	eng	Tom said he's not sure whether Mary wants to do that.
6257002	eng	Tom discouraged me from doing that.
6257003	eng	I should've trusted my instinct.
6257004	eng	Tom said he's not sure whether Mary needs to do that.
6257005	eng	Tom dipped his spoon into the soup.
6257006	eng	I should've gotten here earlier.
6257007	eng	Tom said he wasn't sure if Mary could do that or not.
6257008	eng	Tom died suddenly at the age of 30.
6257009	eng	I should've done that last week.
6257010	eng	Tom said he was going to ask Mary to do that for him.
6257011	eng	Tom died sometime during the night.
6257012	eng	I should've been more organized.
6257013	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to help him do that tomorrow.
6257014	eng	Tom died of stomach cancer in 2013.
6257015	eng	I should've been here yesterday.
6257016	eng	Tom said he thought that Mary would do that tomorrow.
6257017	eng	Tom died of natural causes in 2013.
6257018	eng	I should've been at the meeting.
6257019	eng	Tom said he thought Mary's suggestion was a good one.
6257020	eng	Tom died of a heart attack in 2013.
6257021	eng	I should be in Boston this week.
6257022	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be able to do that.
6257023	eng	Tom died late last month at age 30.
6257024	eng	I should be helping you do that.
6257025	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was good at speaking French.
6257026	eng	Tom died in a shootout with the police.
6257027	eng	I scarcely ever do that anymore.
6257028	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might want to do that today.
6257029	eng	Tom died in 2013 of natural causes.
6257030	eng	I said that I wanted to do that.
6257031	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be allowed to do that.
6257032	eng	Tom died in 2013 of a heart attack.
6257033	eng	I remember doing that somewhere.
6257034	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't be afraid to do that.
6257035	eng	Tom died in 2013 in a car accident.
6257036	eng	I really want to come to Boston.
6257037	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary will agree to do that.
6257038	eng	Tom died in 2013 from tuberculosis.
6257039	eng	I really regret going to Boston.
6257040	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really has to do that.
6257041	eng	Tom didn't want to go to Australia.
6257042	eng	I really don't have much choice.
6257043	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really had to do that.
6257044	eng	Tom didn't want to go there by bus.
6257045	eng	I realized I was being followed.
6257046	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help Mary do that anymore.
6257047	eng	Tom didn't want to do that anymore.
6257048	eng	I often help out in the kitchen.
6257049	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would let John do that.
6257050	eng	Tom didn't want me to speak French.
6257051	eng	I need to go to the post office.
6257052	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would enjoy that movie.
6257053	eng	Tom didn't think you would do that.
6257054	eng	I need to finish what I'm doing.
6257055	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would enjoy doing that.
6257056	eng	Tom didn't think you could do that.
6257057	eng	I need to be in Boston all week.
6257058	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that anymore.
6257059	eng	Tom didn't think he should do that.
6257060	eng	I need to be at today's meeting.
6257061	eng	Tom said he didn't remember exactly where Mary lived.
6257062	eng	Tom didn't think he had to do that.
6257063	eng	I must be in Boston next Monday.
6257064	eng	Tom said he didn't know if Mary could do that or not.
6257065	eng	Tom didn't seem to want to do that.
6257066	eng	I might not go to work tomorrow.
6257067	eng	Tom said he and Mary played tennis yesterday morning.
6257068	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what to do.
6257069	eng	I made this same mistake before.
6257070	eng	Tom said Mary would probably not know how to do that.
6257071	eng	Tom didn't seem like himself today.
6257072	eng	I looked at my appointment book.
6257073	eng	Tom said Mary would probably be reluctant to do that.
6257074	eng	Tom didn't say what you say he did.
6257075	eng	I looked around, but saw no one.
6257076	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't in good enough shape to do that.
6257077	eng	Tom didn't really give me a chance.
6257078	eng	I looked around the locker room.
6257079	eng	Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
6257080	eng	Tom didn't practice much last week.
6257081	eng	I looked around at my coworkers.
6257082	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who wanted to do that.
6257083	eng	Tom didn't mean to do that, did he?
6257084	eng	I like to do that in the summer.
6257085	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who needed to do that.
6257086	eng	Tom didn't know who he could trust.
6257087	eng	I know you won't do that for me.
6257088	eng	Tom said Mary was the one responsible for doing that.
6257089	eng	Tom didn't know about the accident.
6257090	eng	I know you want to go to Boston.
6257091	eng	Tom said Mary was thankful for the chance to do that.
6257092	eng	Tom didn't get a chance to do that.
6257093	eng	I know you need to go to Boston.
6257094	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be in Boston next Monday.
6257095	eng	Tom didn't expect to do that again.
6257096	eng	I know why you're in a bad mood.
6257097	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be determined to do that.
6257098	eng	Tom didn't even apologize for that.
6257099	eng	I know what your car looks like.
6257100	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping she could help John do that.
6257101	eng	Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
6257102	eng	I know what you do for a living.
6257103	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping she could do that with John.
6257104	eng	Tom didn't deserve to lose his job.
6257105	eng	I know we'll be able to do that.
6257106	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might have to do that today.
6257107	eng	Tom did what we expected him to do.
6257108	eng	I know this is important to you.
6257109	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might be allowed to do that.
6257110	eng	Tom did what he was supposed to do.
6257111	eng	I know this is how it has to be.
6257112	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not want to do that.
6257113	eng	Tom did that very enthusiastically.
6257114	eng	I know there's still work to do.
6257115	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not need to do that.
6257116	eng	Tom did that until the day he died.
6257117	eng	I know that you're disappointed.
6257118	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might not have to do that.
6257119	eng	Tom did that the old fashioned way.
6257120	eng	I know that you're conservative.
6257121	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John about what she did.
6257122	eng	Tom did that in a very similar way.
6257123	eng	I know that you want to do that.
6257124	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John about the accident.
6257125	eng	Tom did that in Boston last summer.
6257126	eng	I know that you need to do that.
6257127	eng	Tom said Mary needs to do that before John gets here.
6257128	eng	Tom did that because I told him to.
6257129	eng	I know that you have to do that.
6257130	eng	Tom said Mary needed to do that before John got here.
6257131	eng	Tom did everything we asked of him.
6257132	eng	I know how to get to your place.
6257133	eng	Tom said Mary looked like she was enjoying the party.
6257134	eng	Tom devoted a lot of time to study.
6257135	eng	I know I'm going to be punished.
6257136	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be permitted to do that.
6257137	eng	Tom definitely won't do that again.
6257138	eng	I know I'm going to be arrested.
6257139	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be required to do that.
6257140	eng	Tom definitely deserves to be here.
6257141	eng	I know I shouldn't do that here.
6257142	eng	Tom said Mary isn't sure whether John has to do that.
6257143	eng	Tom dedicated his life to teaching.
6257144	eng	I know I don't have much choice.
6257145	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still waiting in the lobby.
6257146	eng	Tom dedicated his life to medicine.
6257147	eng	I knew I was being photographed.
6257148	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still reluctant to do that.
6257149	eng	Tom decided to continue doing that.
6257150	eng	I knew I didn't have to do that.
6257151	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still motivated to do that.
6257152	eng	Tom cut the cake into eight pieces.
6257153	eng	I just can't come to Boston now.
6257154	eng	Tom said Mary has never been to a Mexican restaurant.
6257155	eng	Tom cut some branches off the tree.
6257156	eng	I intend to do that from now on.
6257157	eng	Tom said Mary has been trying to do that all morning.
6257158	eng	Tom couldn't stop saying thank you.
6257159	eng	I hope we'll be able to do that.
6257160	eng	Tom said Mary has been in the hospital since October.
6257161	eng	Tom could've been more cooperative.
6257162	eng	I held the rope with both hands.
6257163	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will really do that.
6257164	eng	Tom could teach you how to do that.
6257165	eng	I haven't taken out the garbage.
6257166	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that to you.
6257167	eng	Tom could no longer stand the pain.
6257168	eng	I haven't read the instructions.
6257169	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John would do that to you.
6257170	eng	Tom could get fired if he did that.
6257171	eng	I haven't played chess recently.
6257172	eng	Tom refused to do what Mary told him he needed to do.
6257173	eng	Tom could face up to $300 in fines.
6257174	eng	I haven't done that much lately.
6257175	eng	Tom promised he'd go to Boston with Mary next Monday.
6257176	eng	Tom could be in Boston next Monday.
6257177	eng	I have no reason not to do that.
6257178	eng	Tom probably knows where Mary plans to go to college.
6257179	eng	Tom could be determined to do that.
6257180	eng	I have no plans to visit Boston.
6257181	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wanted to do that.
6257182	eng	Tom considered the offer carefully.
6257183	eng	I had no trouble falling asleep.
6257184	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary doesn't like dogs.
6257185	eng	Tom comes from a close-knit family.
6257186	eng	I get up at 6:30 on school days.
6257187	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary called the police.
6257188	eng	Tom closed the store and went home.
6257189	eng	I forbid you to leave the house.
6257190	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary and John broke up.
6257191	eng	Tom claims that doesn't bother him.
6257192	eng	I finished doing that last week.
6257193	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary went to college.
6257194	eng	Tom can't have been a good student.
6257195	eng	I filled both glasses with wine.
6257196	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary wants to do that.
6257197	eng	Tom can't go to Boston this summer.
6257198	eng	I felt a sharp pain in my chest.
6257199	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
6257200	eng	Tom can't come to Boston this year.
6257201	eng	I don't watch TV in the morning.
6257202	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary doesn't like him.
6257203	eng	Tom can't be accused of not trying.
6257204	eng	I don't want you to do that now.
6257205	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary isn't very happy here.
6257206	eng	Tom can probably understand French.
6257207	eng	I don't want to talk to anybody.
6257208	eng	Tom pretty much always does the same thing Mary does.
6257209	eng	Tom can play the bassoon very well.
6257210	eng	I don't want to talk about work.
6257211	eng	Tom must've thought Mary wouldn't be able to do that.
6257212	eng	Tom came to talk to me last Monday.
6257213	eng	I don't want to stay any longer.
6257214	eng	Tom knew it wasn't the first time Mary had done that.
6257215	eng	Tom came to see me in the hospital.
6257216	eng	I don't want to speak to anyone.
6257217	eng	Tom is the one standing next to Mary in this picture.
6257218	eng	Tom came to Boston a lot last year.
6257219	eng	I don't want to speak in French.
6257220	eng	Tom is the man standing next to Mary in this picture.
6257221	eng	Tom came to Australia as a refugee.
6257222	eng	I don't want to lose my license.
6257223	eng	Tom is sure Mary knew she wasn't supposed to do that.
6257224	eng	Tom brushed the dust off his pants.
6257225	eng	I don't want to go to Australia.
6257226	eng	Tom has told Mary that she isn't required to do that.
6257227	eng	Tom brushed the dirt off his pants.
6257228	eng	I don't want to go there by bus.
6257229	eng	Tom has already told Mary he doesn't want to do that.
6257230	eng	Tom blew on his hands to warm them.
6257231	eng	I don't want to go back to jail.
6257232	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6257233	eng	Tom blames his failure on bad luck.
6257234	eng	I don't want to do that tonight.
6257235	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be motivated to do that.
6257236	eng	Tom believed that he could do that.
6257237	eng	I don't want to buy a new piano.
6257238	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be miserable doing that.
6257239	eng	Tom begged me to do that carefully.
6257241	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be in Boston next winter.
6257242	eng	Tom backed the car into the garage.
6257243	eng	I don't usually walk to the gym.
6257244	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be here until after 2:30.
6257245	eng	Tom asked what he could do to help.
6257246	eng	I don't think we did that right.
6257247	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be doing that by herself.
6257248	eng	Tom asked me if I had a girlfriend.
6257249	eng	I don't think Mary is beautiful.
6257250	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary really could do that, does he?
6257251	eng	Tom apparently should've done that.
6257252	eng	I don't think I'll ever do that.
6257253	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can stop John from doing that.
6257254	eng	Tom apologized a few moments later.
6257255	eng	I don't think I'll do that here.
6257256	eng	Tom doesn't really think that Mary did that, does he?
6257257	eng	Tom answered some of the questions.
6257258	eng	I don't think I want to do that.
6257259	eng	Tom doesn't really think Mary could do that, does he?
6257260	eng	Tom and I'll get married next year.
6257261	eng	I don't think I need a new coat.
6257262	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that. Mary will do it for him.
6257263	eng	Tom and I work out at the same gym.
6257264	eng	I don't think I have to do that.
6257265	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't want me to do that.
6257266	eng	Tom and I work at the same factory.
6257267	eng	I don't think I can do that now.
6257268	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary didn't want him to do that.
6257269	eng	Tom and I won't be getting married.
6257270	eng	I don't see why I can't go, too.
6257271	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that. Mary will do it for him.
6257272	eng	Tom and I weren't completely alone.
6257273	eng	I don't regret doing what I did.
6257274	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be doing that by herself.
6257275	eng	Tom and I were the first ones here.
6257276	eng	I don't recommend that approach.
6257277	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be confused, but she was.
6257278	eng	Tom and I were sitting in the back.
6257279	eng	I don't really have much choice.
6257280	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary about the job he'd been offered.
6257281	eng	Tom and I were in Boston last week.
6257282	eng	I don't really enjoy doing that.
6257283	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary was doing that.
6257284	eng	Tom and I were angry at each other.
6257285	eng	I don't really care what you do.
6257286	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary should do that.
6257287	eng	Tom and I went to the zoo together.
6257288	eng	I don't often do that on Monday.
6257289	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary had to do that.
6257290	eng	Tom and I went to a movie together.
6257291	eng	I don't often do that by myself.
6257292	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary didn't want John to do that.
6257293	eng	Tom and I wear the same size shoes.
6257294	eng	I don't need to work on Mondays.
6257295	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was able to do that or not.
6257296	eng	Tom and I took a walk on the beach.
6257297	eng	I don't need to wait any longer.
6257298	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't supposed to do that.
6257299	eng	Tom and I teach at the same school.
6257300	eng	I don't need to decide that now.
6257301	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary used to be a ballet dancer.
6257302	eng	Tom and I talked about the weather.
6257303	eng	I don't like traveling by plane.
6257304	eng	Tom bought a house not too far from where Mary lives.
6257305	eng	Tom and I soon became best friends.
6257306	eng	I don't like to get my feet wet.
6257307	eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that Mary wouldn't do that.
6257308	eng	Tom and I often go hiking together.
6257309	eng	I don't like to be made to wait.
6257310	eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that Mary couldn't do that.
6257311	eng	Tom and I no longer see eye to eye.
6257312	eng	I don't like to be contradicted.
6257313	eng	Tom asked Mary why she thought she needed to do that.
6257314	eng	Tom and I live on different floors.
6257315	eng	I don't like this kind of movie.
6257316	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really wanted to do that again.
6257317	eng	Tom and I haven't been dating long.
6257318	eng	I don't like that kind of stuff.
6257319	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really needed to do that again.
6257320	eng	Tom and I have three grandchildren.
6257321	eng	I don't like speaking in public.
6257322	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew who John taught French to.
6257323	eng	Tom and I have the same hair color.
6257324	eng	I don't like sitting in traffic.
6257325	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew where John went to school.
6257326	eng	Tom and I have the same color eyes.
6257327	eng	I don't know who that person is.
6257328	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't agree on where they should eat.
6257329	eng	Tom and I have something in common.
6257330	eng	I don't know who broke the door.
6257331	eng	Tom almost forgot to tell Mary what she needed to do.
6257332	eng	Tom and I have both studied French.
6257333	eng	I don't know where I need to go.
6257334	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
6257335	eng	Tom and I have a good relationship.
6257336	eng	I don't know where I have to go.
6257337	eng	I'm sure Tom will never permit Mary to do that again.
6257338	eng	Tom and I hardly ever eat together.
6257339	eng	I don't know what I ought to do.
6257340	eng	I'm sure Tom will be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6257341	eng	Tom and I had to postpone our trip.
6257342	eng	I don't know what I need to buy.
6257343	eng	I wonder if Tom knew that Mary couldn't speak French.
6257344	eng	Tom and I had a nice time together.
6257345	eng	I don't know much about sailing.
6257346	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom to show Mary how to do that.
6257347	eng	Tom and I had a good time together.
6257348	eng	I don't know how to write songs.
6257349	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me where Mary had gone.
6257350	eng	Tom and I had a fight this morning.
6257351	eng	I don't know how to write poems.
6257352	eng	I think Tom would be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6257353	eng	Tom and I got everything we needed.
6257354	eng	I don't know how to milk a goat.
6257355	eng	I think Tom is the one who stole Mary's diamond ring.
6257356	eng	Tom and I drove to Boston together.
6257357	eng	I don't know how to do that yet.
6257358	eng	I think Tom could probably talk Mary into doing that.
6257359	eng	Tom and I don't talk to each other.
6257360	eng	I don't know a lot about Boston.
6257361	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary wanted to do that.
6257362	eng	Tom and I don't know what happened.
6257363	eng	I don't intend to pay that much.
6257364	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary needed to do that.
6257365	eng	Tom and I don't get along too well.
6257367	eng	I hope Tom knows he has to do what Mary tells him to do.
6257368	eng	Tom and I didn't agree on anything.
6257369	eng	I don't have to work on Mondays.
6257370	eng	I have no objection to Tom going to Boston with Mary.
6257371	eng	Tom and I bought matching T-shirts.
6257372	eng	I don't have to go there myself.
6257373	eng	I don't think Tom is sure that's what Mary has to do.
6257374	eng	Tom and I attended the same school.
6257375	eng	I don't have to decide that now.
6257376	eng	I didn't know that Tom was studying French with Mary.
6257377	eng	Tom and I arrived at the same time.
6257378	eng	I don't have much time to waste.
6257379	eng	I bet Tom would be able to tell you where Mary lives.
6257380	eng	Tom and I aren't going to help you.
6257381	eng	I don't have any of the details.
6257382	eng	Didn't you know Tom was going to the dance with Mary?
6257383	eng	Tom and I aren't going to be there.
6257384	eng	I don't have a whole lot to say.
6257385	eng	Did you know that Tom was going to do that with Mary?
6257386	eng	Tom and I are not on the same team.
6257387	eng	I don't have a driver's license.
6257388	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary were married to each other?
6257389	eng	Tom and I apologized to each other.
6257390	eng	I don't go to school by the bus.
6257391	eng	Could it have been Tom who stole Mary's diamond ring?
6257392	eng	Tom always seems to be sympathetic.
6257393	eng	I don't go to church very often.
6257394	eng	Tom, Mary and a few other people did that yesterday.
6257395	eng	Tom always had a smile on his face.
6257396	eng	I don't go to Boston very often.
6257397	eng	Tom would've been worried if Mary hadn't been there.
6257398	eng	Tom always does that in the summer.
6257399	eng	I don't feel the same way you do.
6257400	eng	Tom wondered who Mary expected to come to her party.
6257401	eng	Tom almost never does that anymore.
6257402	eng	I don't care if my car is dirty.
6257403	eng	Tom wondered what Mary could do that he couldn't do.
6257404	eng	Tom almost always wears suspenders.
6257405	eng	I don't care about that anymore.
6257406	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he wants to quit his job.
6257407	eng	Tom actually tried to do that once.
6257408	eng	I don't blame you for being mad.
6257409	eng	Tom won't likely be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6257410	eng	Tom's trial will begin in October.
6257411	eng	I don't always do what I'm told.
6257412	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6257413	eng	Tom's shop opened on October 20th.
6257414	eng	I don't actually live in Boston.
6257415	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he needs her to do.
6257416	eng	Tom's life will never be the same.
6257417	eng	I do that three hours every day.
6257418	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
6257419	eng	Tom's last day of work was Monday.
6257420	eng	I didn't want to seem desperate.
6257421	eng	Tom was the one who taught Mary how to ride a horse.
6257422	eng	Tom's killer has never been found.
6257423	eng	I didn't want to read that book.
6257424	eng	Tom was the one who advised Mary to stop doing that.
6257425	eng	Tom's injury seems to have healed.
6257426	eng	I didn't want to move to Boston.
6257427	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he said he would do that.
6257428	eng	Tom hopes to live there someday.
6257429	eng	I didn't want to go to the park.
6257430	eng	Tom told Mary why it would be a bad idea to do that.
6257431	eng	Tom's first reaction was to laugh.
6257432	eng	I didn't want to go to the lake.
6257433	eng	Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be likely to do that.
6257434	eng	Tom's explanation was interesting.
6257435	eng	I didn't want to go there alone.
6257436	eng	Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be afraid to do that.
6257437	eng	Tom's dog scared off the intruder.
6257438	eng	I didn't want to go any further.
6257439	eng	Tom told Mary that he was troubled by what happened.
6257440	eng	Tom's death couldn't be explained.
6257441	eng	I didn't want to do that myself.
6257442	eng	Tom told Mary that he was amused by what was going on.
6257443	eng	Tom's contract runs out this year.
6257444	eng	I didn't want to do it that way.
6257445	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't depressed.
6257446	eng	Tom's contract is for three years.
6257447	eng	I didn't want to be interrupted.
6257448	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't dangerous.
6257449	eng	Tom's best pitch is his curveball.
6257450	eng	I didn't want anything to drink.
6257451	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't conceited.
6257452	eng	Tom wouldn't permit us to do that.
6257453	eng	I didn't want anyone to hear me.
6257454	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was in the attic.
6257455	eng	Tom wouldn't permit me to do that.
6257456	eng	I didn't think you'd understand.
6257457	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was disorganized.
6257458	eng	Tom wouldn't care if you did that.
6257459	eng	I didn't think you'd be nervous.
6257460	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was disappointed.
6257461	eng	Tom would be reluctant to do that.
6257462	eng	I didn't think you'd be jealous.
6257463	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had lost his job.
6257464	eng	Tom would be miserable doing that.
6257465	eng	I didn't think you were jealous.
6257466	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had gotten fired.
6257467	eng	Tom would be fired if he did that.
6257468	eng	I didn't think I'd get punished.
6257469	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had been prudent.
6257470	eng	Tom would be fined if he did that.
6257471	eng	I didn't think I'd get arrested.
6257472	eng	Tom told Mary that he never wanted to do that again.
6257473	eng	Tom won't likely be in Boston now.
6257474	eng	I didn't think I should do that.
6257475	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was healthy.
6257476	eng	Tom won't likely be home tomorrow.
6257477	eng	I didn't think I had to do that.
6257478	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted to find a higher-paying job.
6257479	eng	Tom won't likely be here tomorrow.
6257480	eng	I didn't take a bath last night.
6257481	eng	Tom thought Mary would be unenthusiastic about that.
6257482	eng	Tom won't likely be desperate yet.
6257483	eng	I didn't really need to do that.
6257484	eng	Tom thought Mary would be in Boston for three weeks.
6257485	eng	Tom won't know the answer to that.
6257486	eng	I didn't really have to do that.
6257487	eng	Tom thinks Mary would've come if she'd been invited.
6257488	eng	Tom won't keep me from doing that.
6257489	eng	I didn't realize I had to leave.
6257490	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be through doing that by 2:30.
6257491	eng	Tom won't have to do that anymore.
6257492	eng	I didn't plan on going with you.
6257493	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be present at today's meeting.
6257494	eng	Tom won't do that if it's raining.
6257495	eng	I didn't pay my rent last month.
6257496	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be finished doing that by 2:30.
6257497	eng	Tom won't be reluctant to do that.
6257498	eng	I didn't need to wait very long.
6257499	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that tomorrow evening.
6257500	eng	Tom won't be permitted to do that.
6257501	eng	I didn't like that movie at all.
6257502	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be difficult to get along with.
6257503	eng	Tom won't be motivated to do that.
6257504	eng	I didn't know you were sleeping.
6257505	eng	Tom thinks Mary is glad that that's going to happen.
6257506	eng	Tom won't be able to do that here.
6257507	eng	I didn't know you enjoyed opera.
6257508	eng	Tom still doesn't know the reason why Mary did that.
6257509	eng	Tom will work in Boston next year.
6257510	eng	I didn't know who I could trust.
6257511	eng	Tom should've waited until Mary got here to do that.
6257512	eng	Tom will probably be undependable.
6257513	eng	I didn't know which way to turn.
6257514	eng	Tom should tell Mary he won't go to Boston with her.
6257515	eng	Tom will probably be back by 2:30.
6257516	eng	I didn't know which bus to take.
6257517	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary why he had to do that.
6257518	eng	Tom will never promise to do that.
6257519	eng	I didn't know where I should go.
6257520	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what needs to be done.
6257521	eng	Tom will likely be home on Monday.
6257522	eng	I didn't know what we should do.
6257523	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he can't do that.
6257524	eng	Tom will have to do that tomorrow.
6257525	eng	I didn't know quite what to say.
6257526	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to drive too fast.
6257527	eng	Tom will do that without any help.
6257528	eng	I didn't know anything about it.
6257529	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's going to do that.
6257530	eng	Tom will do that with us tomorrow.
6257531	eng	I didn't intend to stay so long.
6257532	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he intends to do that.
6257533	eng	Tom will do that for you, I think.
6257534	eng	I didn't have to wait very long.
6257535	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary what he has to do.
6257536	eng	Tom will do that even if it rains.
6257537	eng	I didn't have to do that either.
6257538	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary wanted to do that.
6257539	eng	Tom will be in Boston next Monday.
6257540	eng	I didn't have time to eat lunch.
6257541	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary shouldn't do that.
6257542	eng	Tom will be here to do that later.
6257543	eng	I didn't have dinner last night.
6257544	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary needed to do that.
6257545	eng	Tom will be determined to do that.
6257546	eng	I didn't get on the right train.
6257547	eng	Tom says that when he did that, Mary started crying.
6257548	eng	Tom will be able to come tomorrow.
6257549	eng	I didn't get home till midnight.
6257550	eng	Tom says he's heard that Mary wanted to change jobs.
6257551	eng	Tom wasn't the one who complained.
6257552	eng	I didn't fulfill my obligations.
6257553	eng	Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French very well.
6257554	eng	Tom wasn't sure he should do that.
6257555	eng	I didn't feel much like smiling.
6257556	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows why she has to do that.
6257557	eng	Tom wasn't sure he had to do that.
6257558	eng	I didn't feel like eating lunch.
6257559	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who's going to do that.
6257560	eng	Tom wasn't in any rush to do that.
6257561	eng	I didn't expect to win the race.
6257562	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't insist on doing that.
6257563	eng	Tom wasn't afraid to speak French.
6257564	eng	I didn't expect to fall in love.
6257565	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would really do that.
6257566	eng	Tom was very concerned about that.
6257567	eng	I didn't exactly tell the truth.
6257568	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary will want to do that.
6257569	eng	Tom was unenthusiastic about that.
6257570	eng	I didn't do what I wanted to do.
6257571	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary will need to do that.
6257572	eng	Tom was troubled by what happened.
6257573	eng	I didn't do what I needed to do.
6257574	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary will have to do that.
6257575	eng	Tom was too frightened to do that.
6257576	eng	I didn't do that quickly enough.
6257577	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary knows how to do that.
6257578	eng	Tom was told he shouldn't do that.
6257579	eng	I didn't ask any more questions.
6257580	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary does that very often.
6257581	eng	Tom was the only one who did that.
6257582	eng	I didn't answer either question.
6257583	eng	Tom says he doesn't remember asking Mary to do that.
6257584	eng	Tom was the one chosen to do that.
6257585	eng	I did that the same way you did.
6257586	eng	Tom says he doesn't know who Mary wants to help her.
6257587	eng	Tom was the first one to be fired.
6257588	eng	I did that once with my friends.
6257589	eng	Tom says he can't believe Mary would really do that.
6257590	eng	Tom was my best friend in college.
6257591	eng	I did that in spite of the rain.
6257592	eng	Tom says he and Mary played chess yesterday morning.
6257593	eng	Tom was just thirteen at the time.
6257594	eng	I couldn't do that anytime soon.
6257595	eng	Tom says he and Mary often play tennis after school.
6257596	eng	Tom was in Boston three weeks ago.
6257597	eng	I could get fired if I did that.
6257598	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John did that yesterday.
6257599	eng	Tom was doing that here yesterday.
6257600	eng	I could get fined if I did that.
6257601	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John did that for Alice.
6257602	eng	Tom was a bachelor his whole life.
6257603	eng	I changed the locks on my doors.
6257604	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't working in Boston anymore.
6257605	eng	Tom warned me not to speak French.
6257606	eng	I certainly won't do that again.
6257607	eng	Tom said that Mary said she wanted to do that today.
6257608	eng	Tom wants to work as a translator.
6257609	eng	I can't tell you why I did that.
6257610	eng	Tom said that Mary and John weren't married anymore.
6257611	eng	Tom very seldom does that anymore.
6257612	eng	I can't sing as well as you can.
6257613	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary not to do that.
6257614	eng	Tom usually takes a break at 2:30.
6257615	eng	I can't show you how to do that.
6257616	eng	Tom said it was Mary who told him he should do that.
6257617	eng	Tom usually gets what he asks for.
6257618	eng	I can't read without my glasses.
6257619	eng	Tom said it was Mary who told him he had to do that.
6257620	eng	Tom usually gets here around 2:30.
6257621	eng	I can't meet you at the airport.
6257622	eng	Tom said he's still getting text messages from Mary.
6257623	eng	Tom used to enjoy teaching French.
6257624	eng	I can't do everything by myself.
6257625	eng	Tom said he'll probably do that on Monday with Mary.
6257626	eng	Tom used to enjoy studying French.
6257627	eng	I can't come to school tomorrow.
6257628	eng	Tom said he'd be able to do that if Mary helped him.
6257629	eng	Tom told us not to make any noise.
6257630	eng	You can't be much older than I am.
6257631	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be willing to do that for Mary.
6257632	eng	Tom told us he would study French.
6257633	eng	I can't afford to go to college.
6257634	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
6257635	eng	Tom told us he could speak French.
6257636	eng	I can do that without your help.
6257637	eng	Tom said he wished he could do that as well as Mary.
6257638	eng	Tom told me you understood French.
6257639	eng	I can do that in thirty minutes.
6257640	eng	Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself.
6257641	eng	Tom told me why he needed my help.
6257642	eng	I came in through the back door.
6257643	eng	Tom said he wasn't the one who told Mary to do that.
6257644	eng	Tom told me why he didn't do that.
6257645	eng	I came here in order to do that.
6257646	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to show John how to do that.
6257647	eng	Tom told me that you hate dancing.
6257648	eng	I bought you something to drink.
6257649	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very good at French.
6257650	eng	Tom told me that he's unimpressed.
6257651	eng	I bought a house in the suburbs.
6257652	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be permitted to do that.
6257653	eng	Tom told me that he's unconvinced.
6257654	eng	I answered no to both questions.
6257655	eng	Tom said he goes out with Mary at least once a week.
6257656	eng	Tom told me that he's sympathetic.
6257657	eng	I always knew you could do that.
6257658	eng	Tom said he doesn't want Mary to ever do that again.
6257659	eng	Tom told me that he's pessimistic.
6257660	eng	I already know what I should do.
6257661	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary should do that again.
6257662	eng	Tom told me that he's intoxicated.
6257663	eng	How was the picnic last weekend?
6257664	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary knows how to do that.
6257665	eng	Tom told me that he's heartbroken.
6257666	eng	How often do you use a computer?
6257667	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today.
6257668	eng	Tom told me that he's discouraged.
6257669	eng	How often do you go to the pool?
6257670	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary does that very often.
6257671	eng	Tom told me that he was surprised.
6257672	eng	How often do you go to concerts?
6257673	eng	Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
6257674	eng	Tom told me that he was impressed.
6257675	eng	How often do you eat vegetables?
6257676	eng	Tom said he doesn't know if Mary can do that or not.
6257677	eng	Tom told me he's ready to do that.
6257678	eng	How often do you eat persimmons?
6257679	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would let you do that.
6257680	eng	Tom told me he'd do that tomorrow.
6257681	eng	How often do you come to Boston?
6257682	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would let him do that.
6257683	eng	Tom told me I should study French.
6257684	eng	How often are you late for work?
6257685	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really had to do that.
6257686	eng	Tom thought that we could do that.
6257687	eng	How much water is in the bucket?
6257688	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary refused to do that.
6257689	eng	Tom thought I'd already done that.
6257690	eng	How many trees are in your yard?
6257691	eng	Tom said Mary wouldn't likely be fascinated by that.
6257692	eng	Tom thinks he should study French.
6257693	eng	How many times will you do that?
6257694	eng	Tom said Mary would probably be hesitant to do that.
6257695	eng	Tom taught himself how to do that.
6257696	eng	How many sandwiches do you want?
6257697	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who got here on time.
6257698	eng	Tom taught French for a long time.
6257699	eng	How many sandwiches did you eat?
6257700	eng	Tom said Mary was still not very good at doing that.
6257701	eng	Tom taught French for a few years.
6257702	eng	How long will it take to repair?
6257703	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be waiting in the lobby.
6257704	eng	Tom taught French a long time ago.
6257705	eng	How do you plan to go to Boston?
6257706	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be reluctant to do that.
6257707	eng	Tom talked about his expectations.
6257708	eng	Haven't you ever visited Boston?
6257709	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be outside on the porch.
6257710	eng	Tom swore that he'd never do that.
6257711	eng	Get ready to do that right away.
6257712	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be motivated to do that.
6257713	eng	Tom swims every day in the summer.
6257714	eng	Everyone spoke at the same time.
6257715	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be desperate to do that.
6257716	eng	Tom swears he won't do that again.
6257717	eng	Don't forget to check the tires.
6257718	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping you could do that with her.
6257719	eng	Tom sure didn't do that very well.
6257720	eng	Don't do that until I get there.
6257721	eng	Tom said Mary was grateful for what you did for her.
6257722	eng	Tom suggested we do that tomorrow.
6257723	eng	Doing that wouldn't be much fun.
6257724	eng	Tom said Mary was going to go to Boston to see John.
6257725	eng	Tom suggested that we not do that.
6257726	eng	Doing that would probably be OK.
6257727	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not need to do that.
6257728	eng	Tom suggested that I study French.
6257729	eng	Doing that would be interesting.
6257730	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might not have to do that.
6257731	eng	Tom studied French for many years.
6257732	eng	Doing that won't take much time.
6257733	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might need to do that soon.
6257734	eng	Tom stuck his head out the window.
6257735	eng	Doing that likely won't be safe.
6257736	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might have to do that soon.
6257737	eng	Tom stood in the back of the room.
6257738	eng	Doing that didn't make me happy.
6257739	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John why she did that.
6257740	eng	Tom still thinks it's a good idea.
6257741	eng	Doing that did me a lot of good.
6257742	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't have bought what she bought.
6257743	eng	Tom still speaks French every day.
6257744	eng	Does anything seem wrong to you?
6257745	eng	Tom said Mary should've stayed in Boston all summer.
6257746	eng	Tom still sometimes speaks French.
6257747	eng	Do you want to do that tomorrow?
6257748	eng	Tom said Mary needed to do that as soon as possible.
6257749	eng	Tom still refuses to speak French.
6257750	eng	Do you understand sign language?
6257751	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be required to do that.
6257752	eng	Tom still hasn't planted the corn.
6257753	eng	Do you think you'd ever do that?
6257754	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might be permitted to do that.
6257755	eng	Tom still hasn't cleaned his room.
6257756	eng	Do you think doing that was fun?
6257757	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might need to do that today.
6257758	eng	Tom still has an office in Boston.
6257759	eng	Do you like to go to bookstores?
6257760	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that today.
6257761	eng	Tom still doesn't want to do that.
6257762	eng	Do you know what happened today?
6257763	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might be allowed to do that.
6257764	eng	Tom still doesn't need to do that.
6257765	eng	Do you intend to come to Boston?
6257766	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still hesitant to do that.
6257767	eng	Tom still doesn't know what to do.
6257768	eng	Do you have your camera with you?
6257769	eng	Tom said Mary has been robbed more than three times.
6257770	eng	Tom still doesn't have to do that.
6257771	eng	Do you have any help doing that?
6257772	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked not to do that anymore.
6257773	eng	Tom still can't understand French.
6257774	eng	Do you have a permit to do that?
6257775	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John did that with Alice.
6257776	eng	Tom still can't do that very well.
6257777	eng	Do you feel like doing that now?
6257778	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John did that by himself.
6257779	eng	Tom started laughing hysterically.
6257780	eng	Do you ever get sleepy in class?
6257781	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything she needed to do.
6257782	eng	Tom spent his summer on the beach.
6257783	eng	Do all teachers have to do that?
6257784	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have a car she could depend on.
6257785	eng	Tom spends a lot of money on wine.
6257786	eng	Did you know that's from Boston?
6257787	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know why Mary was arrested.
6257788	eng	Tom spends a lot of money on hats.
6257789	eng	Did you know that was happening?
6257790	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary was ignoring him.
6257791	eng	Tom sounds like a smart young man.
6257792	eng	Did you have an afternoon snack?
6257793	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary wants to do that.
6257794	eng	Tom sounds like a really nice guy.
6257795	eng	Could you please give me a hand?
6257796	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is scared of him.
6257797	eng	Tom sounds like a pretty nice guy.
6257798	eng	Could you help me do that today?
6257799	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is afraid of him.
6257800	eng	Tom sounds like a pretty cool kid.
6257801	eng	Can't someone else go to Boston?
6257802	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary went to school.
6257803	eng	Tom sounds a lot like his brother.
6257804	eng	Can you come to Boston tomorrow?
6257805	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary studies French.
6257806	eng	Tom sounded agitated on the phone.
6257807	eng	Can we visit Boston next winter?
6257808	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary parked the car.
6257809	eng	Tom sometimes goes to work by car.
6257810	eng	Both of us want to visit Boston.
6257811	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary goes to school.
6257812	eng	Tom sometimes goes to work by bus.
6257813	eng	Both of us want to go to Boston.
6257814	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what Mary was looking for.
6257815	eng	Tom sometimes cooks dinner for us.
6257816	eng	Both of us need to go to Boston.
6257817	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how Mary feels about that.
6257818	eng	Tom sold his business and retired.
6257819	eng	Both of us have to go to Boston.
6257820	eng	Tom plans to spend his thirtieth birthday with Mary.
6257821	eng	Tom slowly walked down the street.
6257822	eng	Both of my parents are teachers.
6257823	eng	Tom must've thought Mary didn't know how to do that.
6257824	eng	Tom shouldn't have had to do that.
6257825	eng	Be careful not to do that again.
6257826	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he told her he wasn't married.
6257827	eng	Tom shouldn't be too hard to find.
6257828	eng	Are you still unable to do that?
6257829	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he told her he didn't do that.
6257830	eng	Tom should've worn a heavier coat.
6257831	eng	Are you still likely to do that?
6257832	eng	Tom is likely to be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6257833	eng	Tom should've done that years ago.
6257834	eng	Are you still enjoying yourself?
6257835	eng	Tom has told Mary that he isn't required to do that.
6257836	eng	Tom should've done that last week.
6257837	eng	Are you still afraid to do that?
6257838	eng	Tom has finally managed to persuade Mary to do that.
6257839	eng	Tom should've come to the meeting.
6257840	eng	Are we still allowed to do that?
6257841	eng	Tom has asked Mary to do that, so you don't have to.
6257842	eng	Tom should've bought some pencils.
6257843	eng	Are there any fish in this pond?
6257844	eng	Tom has already told Mary that she needs to do that.
6257845	eng	Tom should've been sent to prison.
6257846	eng	All three of us want to do that.
6257847	eng	Tom has a T-shirt just like the one Mary is wearing.
6257848	eng	Tom should've been more organized.
6257849	eng	All three of us need to do that.
6257850	eng	Tom found a stack of lottery tickets in Mary's room.
6257851	eng	Tom should've been home on Monday.
6257852	eng	All three of us have to do that.
6257853	eng	Tom doesn't want to know why Mary wanted to do that.
6257854	eng	Tom should've been here yesterday.
6257855	eng	"May I do that?" "Yes, you may."
6257856	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is the one who did that.
6257857	eng	Tom should try not to be so noisy.
6257858	eng	Your suitcase looks very heavy.
6257859	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would permit John to do that.
6257860	eng	Tom should live in Boston with us.
6257861	eng	Your performance was very good.
6257862	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6257863	eng	Tom should be studying French now.
6257864	eng	Your help isn't needed anymore.
6257865	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will ever be able to do that.
6257866	eng	Tom should be out there right now.
6257867	eng	Your designs are very original.
6257868	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be permitted to do that.
6257869	eng	Tom should be finished doing that.
6257870	eng	Your arm needs to be amputated.
6257871	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be motivated to do that.
6257872	eng	Tom should be charged with murder.
6257873	eng	You're too young to drink beer.
6257874	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be doing that with John.
6257875	eng	Tom should be able to do that now.
6257876	eng	You're too young to buy liquor.
6257877	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is amused by what's going on.
6257878	eng	Tom shares an apartment with John.
6257879	eng	You're too drunk to drive home.
6257880	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can stop him from doing that.
6257881	eng	Tom set the box down on the table.
6257882	eng	You're the smartest man I know.
6257883	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can find the time to do that.
6257884	eng	Tom seldom forgets to do anything.
6257885	eng	You're the smartest guy I know.
6257886	eng	Tom doesn't seem convinced that Mary has to do that.
6257887	eng	Tom seldom drinks beer at parties.
6257888	eng	You're the only one with a key.
6257889	eng	Tom doesn't plan to do that until Mary tells him to.
6257890	eng	Tom seldom buys expensive clothes.
6257891	eng	You're the only drummer I know.
6257892	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary has to do that or not.
6257893	eng	Tom seems to want to study French.
6257894	eng	You're not expected to do that.
6257895	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
6257896	eng	Tom seems to like teaching French.
6257897	eng	You're a very good-looking guy.
6257898	eng	Tom does everything the way Mary tells him to do it.
6257899	eng	Tom seems to like studying French.
6257900	eng	You're a very good storyteller.

6257902	eng	Tom seems to like speaking French.
6257903	eng	You're a scientist, aren't you?
6257904	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6257905	eng	Tom seems to be feeling depressed.
6257907	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be motivated to do that.
6257908	eng	Tom seems to be afraid to do that.
6257909	eng	You're a lot younger than I am.
6257910	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary had done that.
6257911	eng	Tom seems like an intelligent man.
6257912	eng	You're a lot smarter than I am.
6257913	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary didn't want him to do that.
6257914	eng	Tom seemed unconcerned about that.
6257915	eng	You're a hard person to please.
6257916	eng	Tom didn't know how much more money Mary would need.
6257917	eng	Tom seemed to know how to do that.
6257918	eng	You're a gun owner, aren't you?
6257919	eng	Tom didn't know how much money Mary had in the bank.
6257920	eng	Tom seemed to have figured it out.
6257921	eng	You're a good basketball coach.
6257922	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wasn't good at speaking French.
6257923	eng	Tom seemed to be eager to do that.
6257924	eng	You're a cat lover, aren't you?
6257925	eng	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that John would do that.
6257926	eng	Tom seemed like a really good guy.
6257927	eng	You're a bit younger than I am.
6257928	eng	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that John would be late.
6257929	eng	Tom seemed like a nice enough guy.
6257930	eng	You're a bit shorter than I am.
6257931	eng	Tom asked Mary what time she needed him to be there.
6257932	eng	Tom searched his bag for a pencil.
6257933	eng	You're a bartender, aren't you?
6257934	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd be interested in doing that.
6257935	eng	Tom scored 13 points for our team.
6257936	eng	You'll have to do that as well.
6257937	eng	Tom asked Mary if she would mind doing that for him.
6257938	eng	Tom says things have gotten tough.
6257939	eng	You'll get a chance to do that.
6257940	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew why John didn't like him.
6257941	eng	Tom says that's his favorite book.
6257942	eng	You'll do that, too, won't you?
6257943	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John's birthday was.
6257944	eng	Tom says that isn't a big problem.
6257945	eng	You'll do that soon, won't you?
6257946	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew when John had to do that.
6257947	eng	Tom says that he's a good student.
6257948	eng	You'll do that again, I'm sure.
6257949	eng	Tom and Mary live across the street from each other.
6257950	eng	Tom says that he'll do that today.
6257951	eng	You'll cook tonight, won't you?
6257952	eng	Tom and Mary have decided to postpone their wedding.
6257953	eng	Tom says that he wants to do that.
6257954	eng	You'll be able to do that, too.
6257955	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't agree on where they should go.
6257956	eng	Tom says it's too late to do that.
6257957	eng	You'd fight back, wouldn't you?
6257958	eng	Tom and I were talking about Mary just this morning.
6257959	eng	Tom says it's time to take action.
6257960	eng	You'd better do that carefully.
6257961	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what Mary asked him to do.
6257962	eng	Tom says it's a risk worth taking.
6257963	eng	You'd be fired if you did that.
6257964	eng	The boy's name is Tom and his sister's name is Mary.
6257965	eng	Tom says his stomach doesn't hurt.
6257966	eng	You weren't hurt bad, were you?
6257967	eng	I'm sure that Tom wouldn't mind doing that for Mary.
6257968	eng	Tom says he's too busy to do that.
6257969	eng	You want to do that, don't you?
6257970	eng	I'm sure Tom will be faster at doing that than Mary.
6257971	eng	Tom says he's tired of doing that.
6257972	eng	You sure were noisy last night.
6257973	eng	I was surprised when Tom told me what Mary had done.
6257974	eng	Tom says he's prepared to do that.
6257975	eng	You shouldn't be in Boston now.
6257976	eng	I think Tom would be faster at doing that than Mary.
6257977	eng	Tom says he's never taught French.
6257978	eng	You should've done that sooner.
6257979	eng	I think Tom isn't sure that's what Mary wants to do.
6257980	eng	Tom says he'll study French today.
6257981	eng	You should start getting ready.
6257982	eng	I think Tom isn't sure that's what Mary needs to do.
6257983	eng	Tom says he'll do whatever he can.
6257984	eng	You should go outside and play.
6257985	eng	I suspect that Tom and Mary are planning to get married.
6257986	eng	Tom says he'll do that by himself.
6257987	eng	You should consider doing that.
6257988	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary don't like each other.
6257989	eng	Tom says he won't need to do that.
6257990	eng	You should admit your mistakes.
6257991	eng	I didn't think Tom really did what Mary said he did.
6257992	eng	Tom says he won't help us do that.
6257993	eng	You seemed to enjoy doing that.
6257994	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to be married to Mary?
6257995	eng	Tom says he won't have to do that.
6257996	eng	You saw us do that, didn't you?
6257997	eng	Did you know that Tom was going to Boston with Mary?
6257998	eng	Tom says he won't do that for you.
6257999	eng	You said you'd quit doing that.
6258000	eng	You knew that Tom told Mary to do that, didn't you?
6258001	eng	Tom says he won't do that anymore.
6258002	eng	You said you'd help us do that.
6258003	eng	Tom, Mary and I went to the same elementary school.
6258004	eng	Tom says he wants to speak French.
6258005	eng	You said you'd help me do that.
6258006	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't in her room, studying.
6258007	eng	Tom says he wants to do that, too.
6258008	eng	You really should visit Boston.
6258009	eng	Tom wondered who Mary wanted at her birthday party.
6258010	eng	Tom says he wants to be a teacher.
6258011	eng	You promised to do that for us.
6258012	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted him to park the car.
6258013	eng	Tom says he tried to do that once.
6258014	eng	You plan to do that, don't you?
6258015	eng	Tom wondered where Mary had learned French so well.
6258016	eng	Tom says he thinks he can do that.
6258017	eng	You offered to help us do that.
6258018	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6258019	eng	Tom says he still does that a lot.
6258020	eng	You need to think for yourself.
6258021	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
6258022	eng	Tom says he plans to study French.
6258023	eng	You need to do that more often.
6258024	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what she wants to know.
6258025	eng	Tom says he needs to study French.
6258026	eng	You must not come here anymore.
6258027	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary to look out the window.
6258028	eng	Tom says he likes teaching French.
6258029	eng	You must be tempted to do that.
6258030	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that he wants her help.
6258031	eng	Tom says he likes studying French.
6258032	eng	You may take any book you like.
6258033	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he won't do that again.
6258034	eng	Tom says he likes speaking French.
6258035	eng	You love doing that, don't you?
6258036	eng	Tom wasn't much better at doing that than Mary was.
6258037	eng	Tom says he just couldn't do that.
6258038	eng	You look like your grandfather.
6258039	eng	Tom was surprised that Mary wasn't able to do that.
6258040	eng	Tom says he feels like doing that.
6258041	eng	You look like you have an idea.
6258042	eng	Tom was surprised that Mary didn't know what to do.
6258043	eng	Tom says he doesn't have a lawyer.
6258044	eng	You look a little better today.
6258045	eng	Tom was kind of surprised that Mary wanted to that.
6258046	eng	Tom says he didn't have insurance.
6258047	eng	You like to do that, don't you?
6258048	eng	Tom was kind of surprised that Mary didn't do that.
6258049	eng	Tom says he can't remember things.
6258050	eng	You left your office door open.
6258051	eng	Tom wanted to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
6258052	eng	Tom says I shouldn't speak French.
6258054	eng	Tom told Mary the reason he didn't want to do that.
6258055	eng	Tom saw me while I was doing that.
6258056	eng	You have to do that right away.
6258057	eng	Tom told Mary that he was interested in doing that.
6258058	eng	Tom sat looking out of the window.
6258059	eng	You have to do that more often.
6258060	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't creative.
6258061	eng	Tom said, "I'll do that tomorrow."
6258062	eng	You had every right to do that.
6258063	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was unconvinced.
6258064	eng	Tom said the gunshots woke him up.
6258065	eng	You fired your gun, didn't you?
6258066	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was unconscious.
6258067	eng	Tom said the case has been closed.
6258068	eng	You don't look like you're mad.
6258069	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was intoxicated.
6258070	eng	Tom said the best was yet to come.
6258071	eng	You don't like carrots, do you?
6258072	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was intelligent.
6258073	eng	Tom said that's not what he wants.
6258074	eng	You don't know my name, do you?
6258075	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was incompetent.
6258076	eng	Tom said that he's been very busy.
6258077	eng	You don't do that well, do you?
6258078	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was heartbroken.
6258079	eng	Tom said that he wouldn't do that.
6258080	eng	You don't do that much, do you?
6258081	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was hardworking.
6258082	eng	Tom said that he wasn't impressed.
6258083	eng	You did that again, didn't you?
6258084	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was embarrassed.
6258085	eng	Tom said that he wants to do that.
6258086	eng	You definitely need to do that.
6258087	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was discouraged.
6258088	eng	Tom said that I shouldn't do that.
6258089	eng	You could do that if you tried.
6258090	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was attractive.
6258091	eng	Tom said some things won't change.
6258092	eng	You can swim, too, if you want.
6258093	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been miserable in Boston.
6258094	eng	Tom said it's been fun doing that.
6258095	eng	You can swim better than I can.
6258096	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think she'd been fair.
6258097	eng	Tom said it's been fun being here.
6258098	eng	You can do that if you want to.
6258099	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was stoned.
6258100	eng	Tom said it was raining in Boston.
6258101	eng	You apparently need to do that.
6258102	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was insane.
6258103	eng	Tom said it should've been simple.
6258104	eng	You apparently have to do that.
6258105	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was boring.
6258106	eng	Tom said his team will likely win.
6258107	eng	Would you please come tomorrow?
6258108	eng	Tom told Mary that John had decided not to do that.
6258109	eng	Tom said his schedule will change.
6258110	eng	Would you like to live forever?
6258111	eng	Tom told Mary he could probably do that by himself.
6258112	eng	Tom said his schedule has changed.
6258113	eng	Would mind if I did that today?
6258115	eng	Tom said his job was a lot of fun.
6258116	eng	Women and girls should do that.
6258117	eng	Tom thought Mary would be the first one to do that.
6258118	eng	Tom said his house wasn't damaged.
6258119	eng	Will you please do that for me?
6258120	eng	Tom thought Mary would be interested in doing that.
6258121	eng	Tom said his conscience was clear.
6258122	eng	Will you go shopping next week?
6258123	eng	Tom thought Mary would be confused, but she wasn't.
6258124	eng	Tom said he's very busy this week.
6258125	eng	Will you do that tomorrow, too?
6258126	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't present at today's meeting.
6258127	eng	Tom said he's very busy right now.
6258128	eng	Will I be permitted to do that?
6258129	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be unenthusiastic about that.
6258130	eng	Tom said he's studying French now.
6258131	eng	Why shouldn't I come to Boston?
6258132	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be surprised if you did that.
6258133	eng	Tom said he's seen people do that.
6258134	eng	Why do you want to do that now?
6258135	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be amused by what's going on.
6258136	eng	Tom said he's only done that once.
6258137	eng	Why do you have to do that now?
6258138	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be amused by what's going on.
6258139	eng	Tom said he's never taught French.
6258140	eng	Why do we need to go to Boston?
6258141	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be ready to do that on Monday.
6258142	eng	Tom said he's hesitant to do that.
6258143	eng	Why do we need to be in Boston?
6258144	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be present at today's meeting.
6258145	eng	Tom said he's finished doing that.
6258146	eng	Why do we have to go to Boston?
6258147	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that until lunchtime.
6258148	eng	Tom said he'll be doing that soon.
6258149	eng	Why do we have to be in Boston?
6258150	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that for a few hours.
6258151	eng	Tom said he'd like to do that now.
6258152	eng	Why didn't you want to do that?
6258153	eng	Tom suggested to Mary that she go there by bicycle.
6258154	eng	Tom said he'd consider doing that.
6258155	eng	Why didn't you need to do that?
6258156	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary is supposed to do.
6258157	eng	Tom said he'd be back next Monday.
6258158	eng	Why didn't you have to do that?
6258159	eng	Tom soon found out why Mary didn't want to do that.
6258160	eng	Tom said he wouldn't speak French.
6258161	eng	Why did that make a difference?
6258162	eng	Tom should've been quicker at doing that than Mary.
6258163	eng	Tom said he won't do that anymore.
6258164	eng	Why can't we go to Boston, too?
6258165	eng	Tom should tell Mary to take her umbrella with her.
6258166	eng	Tom said he wasn't good at French.
6258167	eng	Who does this jacket belong to?
6258168	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what she needs to do.
6258169	eng	Tom said he was unable to do that.
6258170	eng	Who does this camera belong to?
6258171	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what he needs to buy.
6258172	eng	Tom said he was too young to vote.
6258173	eng	Who do you think would be best?
6258174	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to be frightened.
6258175	eng	Tom said he was somewhat confused.
6258176	eng	Who do you always do that with?
6258177	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's going to Boston.
6258178	eng	Tom said he was happy he did that.
6258179	eng	Who came up with this schedule?
6258180	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he doesn't like John.
6258181	eng	Tom said he wants to write a book.
6258182	eng	Who buys these kinds of things?
6258183	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he won't do that.
6258184	eng	Tom said he wants to study French.
6258185	eng	Which bicycle do you like best?
6258186	eng	Tom says if he doesn't do that, Mary will be angry.
6258187	eng	Tom said he wants to be a teacher.
6258188	eng	Where should we stay in Boston?
6258189	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary wants to do that.
6258190	eng	Tom said he wanted to leave early.
6258191	eng	Where do you intend to do that?
6258192	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary needs to do that.
6258193	eng	Tom said he walked home yesterday.
6258194	eng	When will you return to Boston?
6258195	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary doesn't like him.
6258196	eng	Tom said he tried to do that once.
6258197	eng	When it rains, I don't do that.
6258198	eng	Tom says he doesn't care whether Mary stays or not.
6258199	eng	Tom said he thinks he can do that.
6258200	eng	When do you want me to do that?
6258201	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would have to do that.
6258202	eng	Tom said he sold his car for $300.
6258203	eng	What's your grandmother's name?
6258204	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John did that to Alice.
6258205	eng	Tom said he plans to study French.
6258206	eng	What you're doing is unethical.
6258207	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John actually did that.
6258208	eng	Tom said he needs to study French.
6258209	eng	What you're doing is dangerous.
6258210	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John really did that.
6258211	eng	Tom said he needs to get some air.
6258212	eng	What kind of girls do you like?
6258213	eng	Tom said that wasn't the real reason Mary did that.
6258214	eng	Tom said he likes teaching French.
6258215	eng	What kind of games do you like?
6258216	eng	Tom said that Mary's complaining didn't bother him.
6258217	eng	Tom said he likes studying French.
6258218	eng	What exactly do you need to do?
6258219	eng	Tom said that Mary will do that as soon as she can.
6258220	eng	Tom said he likes speaking French.
6258221	eng	What exactly do you have to do?
6258222	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't living in Boston anymore.
6258223	eng	Tom said he liked teaching French.
6258224	eng	What do you put into your stew?
6258225	eng	Tom said that Mary thought doing that would be fun.
6258226	eng	Tom said he liked studying French.
6258227	eng	What did that look like to you?
6258228	eng	Tom said that Mary shouldn't have been so careless.
6258229	eng	Tom said he liked speaking French.
6258230	eng	We'll never go to Boston again.
6258231	eng	Tom said that Mary said she didn't like to do that.
6258232	eng	Tom said he learned something new.
6258233	eng	We'll do that even if it rains.
6258234	eng	Tom said that Mary couldn't wait to see John again.
6258235	eng	Tom said he knew he could do that.
6258236	eng	We were busy all day yesterday.
6258237	eng	Tom said he's tired of waiting for Mary to do that.
6258238	eng	Tom said he kept asking questions.
6258239	eng	We seldom go to Boston anymore.
6258240	eng	Tom said he's not sure whether Mary has to do that.
6258241	eng	Tom said he jumped out of the way.
6258242	eng	We sat down and started eating.
6258243	eng	Tom said he'd probably do that on Monday with Mary.
6258244	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd win the race.
6258245	eng	We often see foxes around here.
6258246	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why Mary had to do that.
6258247	eng	Tom said he hasn't studied French.
6258248	eng	We live in different countries.
6258249	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't asked Mary to do that.
6258250	eng	Tom said he has to get more sleep.
6258251	eng	We didn't do that by ourselves.
6258252	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to show him how to do that.
6258253	eng	Tom said he feels like doing that.
6258254	eng	We did that a couple weeks ago.
6258255	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what Mary wanted to do.
6258256	eng	Tom said he feared for his safety.
6258257	eng	This isn't the time to do that.
6258258	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what Mary needed to do.
6258259	eng	Tom said he enjoyed the challenge.
6258260	eng	This is where I found your key.
6258261	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be happy to do that.
6258262	eng	Tom said he doesn't smoke anymore.
6258263	eng	This is a very comfortable bed.
6258264	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him.
6258265	eng	Tom said he didn't know the rules.
6258266	eng	These lenses are scratch-proof.
6258267	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not want to do that.
6258268	eng	Tom said he couldn't speak French.
6258269	eng	These jeans are too big for me.
6258270	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that.
6258271	eng	Tom said he could help us do that.
6258272	eng	There's still a lot more to do.
6258273	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that.
6258274	eng	Tom said he considered doing that.
6258275	eng	There's no time to do that now.
6258276	eng	Tom said he knew where Mary learned how to do that.
6258277	eng	Tom said he acted in self-defense.
6258278	eng	There's no easy way to do that.
6258279	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might be required to do that.
6258280	eng	Tom said goodnight to his parents.
6258281	eng	There are more of them than us.
6258282	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be willing to do that.
6258283	eng	Tom said doing that would be safe.
6258284	eng	The window in my room is dirty.
6258285	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be allowed to do that.
6258286	eng	Tom said doing that wasn't enough.
6258288	eng	Tom said he expected Mary do the same thing he did.
6258289	eng	Tom said I needed to study French.
6258290	eng	That would be impossible to do.
6258291	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary parked the car.
6258292	eng	Tom said I looked really confused.
6258293	eng	Tell me why you went to Boston.
6258294	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help Mary do that today.
6258295	eng	Tom said I looked like an old man.
6258296	eng	Someone's doing that right now.
6258297	eng	Tom said he didn't want to help Mary do that again.
6258298	eng	Tom said I looked like I was busy.
6258299	eng	Please let me buy that for you.
6258300	eng	Tom said he didn't want Mary to ever do that again.
6258301	eng	Tom said I don't get enough sleep.
6258302	eng	Please don't speak French here.
6258303	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
6258304	eng	Tom said I didn't sound surprised.
6258305	eng	Please don't forget to do that.
6258306	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary had to do that again.
6258307	eng	Tom said I didn't sound convinced.
6258308	eng	Please don't come here anymore.
6258309	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary wanted to do that.
6258310	eng	Tom said I didn't sound confident.
6258311	eng	Perhaps you'd enjoy doing that.
6258312	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary needed to do that.
6258313	eng	Tom said I didn't need to do that.
6258314	eng	Perhaps I need to do that, too.
6258315	eng	Tom said Mary would probably go to Boston with him.
6258316	eng	Tom returned to Australia in 2013.
6258317	eng	Our troubles are far from over.
6258318	eng	Tom said Mary would probably be willing to do that.
6258319	eng	Tom retired from the Navy in 2013.
6258320	eng	Our train was three hours late.
6258321	eng	Tom said Mary would likely not know how to do that.
6258322	eng	Tom retired from teaching in 2013.
6258323	eng	Our proposal wasn't acceptable.
6258324	eng	Tom said Mary would likely be motivated to do that.
6258325	eng	Tom retired from politics in 2013.
6258326	eng	Our problems are far from over.
6258327	eng	Tom said Mary was too short to reach the top shelf.
6258328	eng	Tom retired from coaching in 2013.
6258329	eng	Now's the time we should leave.
6258330	eng	Tom said Mary was sleeping by the time he got home.
6258331	eng	Tom repaired his watch by himself.
6258332	eng	My plan is to do that tomorrow.
6258333	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be hesitant to do that.
6258334	eng	Tom reluctantly agreed to do that.
6258335	eng	My mother told me to come home.
6258336	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping you could do that for her.
6258337	eng	Tom refused to sign the documents.
6258338	eng	My mother has gotten remarried.
6258339	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not want to do that.
6258340	eng	Tom recommended these books to me.
6258341	eng	My lawyer told me it was legal.
6258342	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not need to do that.
6258343	eng	Tom really wants to sing with you.
6258344	eng	My last day of work was Monday.
6258345	eng	Tom said Mary thought he might not have to do that.
6258346	eng	Tom really wants to do that today.
6258347	eng	My job description has changed.
6258349	eng	Tom really wants to do that again.
6258350	eng	My injuries weren't so serious.
6258351	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't tell John how she did that.
6258352	eng	Tom really wanted to study French.
6258353	eng	My house needs to be repainted.
6258354	eng	Tom said Mary probably couldn't do that by herself.
6258355	eng	Tom really should've tried harder.
6258356	eng	My house doesn't have a garage.
6258357	eng	Tom said Mary needs to do that as soon as possible.
6258358	eng	Tom really enjoys being a teacher.
6258359	eng	My friends did that without me.
6258360	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that.
6258361	eng	Tom really doesn't need the money.
6258362	eng	My father told me an old story.
6258363	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might be required to do that.
6258364	eng	Tom really does do that sometimes.
6258365	eng	My family seldom eats together.
6258366	eng	Tom said Mary is still not very good at doing that.
6258367	eng	Tom really didn't want to do that.
6258368	eng	My family owns this restaurant.
6258369	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
6258370	eng	Tom reached the finish line first.
6258371	eng	My dog was run over by a truck.
6258372	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still tempted to do that.
6258373	eng	Tom rarely ever does that anymore.
6258374	eng	My contract is for three years.
6258375	eng	Tom said Mary is looking forward to her retirement.
6258376	eng	Tom rarely does that before lunch.
6258377	eng	My children can't speak French.
6258378	eng	Tom said Mary is going to go to Boston to see John.
6258379	eng	Tom ran away as soon as he saw me.
6258380	eng	My children are already asleep.
6258381	eng	Tom said Mary has to do that before John gets here.
6258382	eng	Tom put the box down on the table.
6258383	eng	My car isn't where I parked it.
6258384	eng	Tom said Mary has only done that about three times.
6258385	eng	Tom put his cup down on the table.
6258386	eng	My business is doing very well.
6258387	eng	Tom said Mary has been to Australia more than once.
6258388	eng	Tom put his T-shirt on inside out.
6258389	eng	My bedroom only has one window.
6258390	eng	Tom said Mary gets home every Monday at about 2:30.
6258391	eng	Tom put a fence around his garden.
6258392	eng	My barn burned down last night.
6258393	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John did that yesterday.
6258394	eng	Tom promised not to do that again.
6258395	eng	Most people here don't do that.
6258396	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John did that for Alice.
6258397	eng	Tom promised not to be late again.
6258398	eng	Most people here can't do that.
6258399	eng	Tom said Mary didn't seem to be willing to do that.
6258400	eng	Tom promised me he'd study French.
6258401	eng	More research needs to be done.
6258402	eng	Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary about what happened.
6258403	eng	Tom probably hasn't gone home yet.
6258404	eng	Men and boys shouldn't do that.
6258405	eng	Tom said I should've asked Mary to help me do that.
6258406	eng	Tom probably doesn't speak French.
6258407	eng	Let's not do that by ourselves.
6258408	eng	Tom reminded Mary that she needed to do that today.
6258409	eng	Tom probably did that last Monday.
6258410	eng	Let's go to Boston next spring.
6258411	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary let you do that.
6258412	eng	Tom prefers to do that on his own.
6258413	eng	It's very important to do that.
6258414	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary kept doing that.
6258415	eng	Tom plans on studying French, too.
6258416	eng	It's useless to try doing that.
6258417	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is ignoring him.
6258418	eng	Tom passed his French examination.
6258419	eng	It's time to turn on the light.
6258420	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary hasn't left yet.
6258421	eng	Tom passed away in 2013 in Boston.
6258422	eng	It's hard doing that every day.
6258423	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary was yesterday.
6258424	eng	Tom owes his success to good luck.
6258425	eng	It's easy to do that, isn't it?
6258426	eng	Tom probably doesn't know what Mary is looking for.
6258427	eng	Tom only spent three days in jail.
6258428	eng	It's annoying when you do that.
6258429	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary should do that.
6258430	eng	Tom only does what he wants to do.
6258431	eng	It's a good day for doing that.
6258432	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary isn't Canadian.
6258433	eng	Tom only does what he needs to do.
6258434	eng	It'll be depressing to do that.
6258435	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary has to do that.
6258436	eng	Tom often laughs at his own jokes.
6258437	eng	It wouldn't be easy to do that.
6258438	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary didn't do that.
6258439	eng	Tom often goes abroad on business.
6258440	eng	It would be logical to do that.
6258442	eng	Tom often forgets to pay his rent.
6258443	eng	It would be fun to do that now.
6258444	eng	Tom isn't likely to permit Mary to do that for him.
6258445	eng	Tom often complains about his job.
6258446	eng	It would be foolish to do that.
6258447	eng	Tom isn't going to be very happy if Mary does that.
6258448	eng	Tom no longer works at the clinic.
6258449	eng	It was very hot inside the bus.
6258450	eng	Tom is the only one who ever really talked to Mary.
6258451	eng	Tom never takes me out for dinner.
6258452	eng	It was very foolish to do that.
6258453	eng	Tom is positive that Mary was the one who did that.
6258454	eng	Tom never stays out late at night.
6258455	eng	It was a lot of fun doing that.
6258456	eng	Tom is lucky that Mary is still willing to do that.
6258457	eng	Tom never lost his sense of humor.
6258458	eng	It should be OK to do that now.
6258459	eng	Tom is likely to be faster at doing that than Mary.
6258460	eng	Tom never had hip problems before.
6258461	eng	It makes good sense to do that.
6258462	eng	Tom has told Mary that she doesn't need to do that.
6258463	eng	Tom never forgets to pay his rent.
6258464	eng	Is your new coat black or gray?
6258465	eng	Tom has told Mary that she doesn't have to do that.
6258466	eng	Tom never expected this to happen.
6258467	eng	Is it all right to do that now?
6258468	eng	Tom has decided Mary is the one who should do that.
6258469	eng	Tom never did what you say he did.
6258470	eng	In case of emergency, call 911.
6258471	eng	Tom has advised Mary not to start doing that again.
6258472	eng	Tom never did finish his homework.
6258473	eng	If I had the time, I'd do that.
6258474	eng	Tom had no idea what Mary was thinking about doing.
6258475	eng	Tom never complains about his job.
6258476	eng	I've never seen you cry before.
6258477	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she told him she needed.
6258478	eng	Tom never comes to Boston anymore.
6258479	eng	I've never done that, you know.
6258480	eng	Tom doesn't want to know why Mary wants to do that.
6258481	eng	Tom needs to learn how to do that.
6258482	eng	I've grown tired of doing that.
6258483	eng	Tom doesn't think he can stop Mary from doing that.
6258484	eng	Tom needs to know the reasons why.
6258485	eng	I've filled the jug with water.
6258486	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would permit him to do that.
6258487	eng	Tom must've wanted to leave early.
6258488	eng	I've done that countless times.
6258489	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be tempted to do that.
6258490	eng	Tom must be in really great shape.
6258491	eng	I've been asked not to do that.
6258492	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be nervous doing that.
6258493	eng	Tom must be doing something wrong.
6258494	eng	I'm very sorry that I did that.
6258495	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be frightened by that.
6258496	eng	Tom must be doing something right.
6258497	eng	I'm very determined to do that.
6258498	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would allow John to do that.
6258499	eng	Tom must be determined to do that.
6258500	eng	I'm thinking of doing that now.
6258501	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will permit John to do that.
6258502	eng	Tom might be charged with perjury.
6258503	eng	I'm thinking about the problem.
6258504	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be doing that with him.
6258505	eng	Tom may do that wherever he wants.
6258506	eng	I'm the only guy in this class.
6258507	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is interested in doing that.
6258508	eng	Tom may do that anywhere he wants.
6258509	eng	I'm still reluctant to do that.
6258510	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is going to want to do that.
6258511	eng	Tom managed to escape from prison.
6258512	eng	I'm still not fluent in French.
6258513	eng	Tom doesn't really think Mary can do that, does he?
6258514	eng	Tom managed to do that on his own.
6258515	eng	I'm still doing the same thing.
6258516	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't like his friends.
6258517	eng	Tom managed to do that by himself.
6258518	eng	I'm prohibited from doing that.
6258519	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary and John hate each other.
6258520	eng	Tom makes things very easy for me.
6258521	eng	I'm not too old to do that yet.
6258522	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is a Canadian or not.
6258523	eng	Tom made up his mind to try again.
6258524	eng	I'm not sure what I need to do.
6258525	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary can sing well or not.
6258526	eng	Tom made several serious mistakes.
6258527	eng	I'm not sure what I have to do.
6258528	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary can cook well or not.
6258529	eng	Tom lost the job he had in Boston.
6258530	eng	I'm not sure I need to do that.
6258531	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is the one who did that.
6258532	eng	Tom looks very happy this morning.
6258533	eng	I'm not any good at doing that.
6258534	eng	Tom didn't want to know why Mary wanted to do that.
6258535	eng	Tom looked very comfortable to me.
6258536	eng	I'm nervous whenever I do that.
6258537	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be in Boston this week.
6258538	eng	Tom looked like he was in a hurry.
6258539	eng	My daughter drew me a picture.
6258540	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6258541	eng	Tom looked like he was having fun.
6258543	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be at school on Monday.
6258544	eng	Tom looked back over his shoulder.
6258545	eng	I'll try my hardest to do that.
6258546	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was the first one to do that.
6258547	eng	Tom looked back at me and grinned.
6258548	eng	I'll study French this evening.
6258549	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was interested in doing that.
6258550	eng	Tom looked at me again and smiled.
6258551	eng	I'll see what I can do to help.
6258552	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was in her office on Mondays.
6258553	eng	Tom looked around the locker room.
6258554	eng	I'll only do that if I have to.
6258555	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary to take her umbrella with her.
6258556	eng	Tom lives with his wife in Boston.
6258557	eng	I'll have to do that by myself.
6258558	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he wanted to find another job.
6258559	eng	Tom lives over there on that hill.
6258560	eng	I'll do that only if I have to.
6258561	eng	Tom didn't seem to be aware of what Mary was doing.
6258562	eng	Tom lived there about three years.
6258563	eng	I'll do that as long as I live.
6258564	eng	Tom didn't seem convinced that Mary had to do that.
6258565	eng	Tom lived in Australia until 2013.
6258566	eng	I'd visit Boston if I were you.
6258567	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was having fun or not.
6258568	eng	Tom let his dog loose in the yard.
6258569	eng	I'd prefer not to go to Boston.
6258570	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was a Canadian or not.
6258571	eng	Tom left the police force in 2013.
6258572	eng	I'd prefer not to do that here.
6258573	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was thinking about doing.
6258574	eng	Tom left his son alone in the car.
6258575	eng	I'd never try to do that alone.
6258576	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wouldn't be at the party.
6258577	eng	Tom left high school at seventeen.
6258578	eng	I'd love to visit Boston again.
6258579	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was the one who did that.
6258580	eng	Tom leaves for Australia tomorrow.
6258581	eng	I'd like you to do that for me.
6258582	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's ex-girlfriend.
6258583	eng	Tom knows what you're looking for.
6258584	eng	I'd like a hamburger and fries.
6258585	eng	Tom didn't know how much money he should give Mary.
6258586	eng	Tom knows very little about music.
6258587	eng	I'd go to Boston if I were you.
6258588	eng	Tom didn't know how long Mary expected him to wait.
6258589	eng	Tom knows tonight will be special.
6258590	eng	I'd be glad to do that for you.
6258591	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to do that today.
6258592	eng	Tom knows that won't happen today.
6258593	eng	I would've bought that for you.
6258594	eng	Tom could tell that Mary wasn't having a good time.
6258595	eng	Tom knows how to get a hold of me.
6258596	eng	I worked on a farm last summer.
6258597	eng	Tom could easily have stopped Mary from doing that.
6258598	eng	Tom knows every trick in the book.
6258599	eng	I wonder why I need to do that.
6258600	eng	Tom assured Mary that he would never do that again.
6258601	eng	Tom knows every inch of this area.
6258602	eng	I won't likely need to do that.
6258603	eng	Tom asked me to try to talk Mary out of doing that.
6258604	eng	Tom knows all about what happened.
6258605	eng	I won't likely have to do that.
6258606	eng	Tom asked if Mary really had to do that by herself.
6258607	eng	Tom knows I'm supposed to do that.
6258608	eng	I won't have to do that myself.
6258609	eng	Tom asked Mary where she was planning to meet John.
6258610	eng	Tom knew what he was getting into.
6258611	eng	I won't be in Boston next week.
6258612	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that by herself.
6258613	eng	Tom knew tonight would be special.
6258614	eng	I won't be doing that tomorrow.
6258615	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that by herself.
6258616	eng	Tom knew the job wouldn't be easy.
6258617	eng	I won't attend today's meeting.
6258618	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew who John was married to.
6258619	eng	Tom just wants love and attention.
6258620	eng	I wish you knew how to do that.
6258621	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other for a long time.
6258622	eng	Tom just does what he wants to do.
6258623	eng	I wish to speak to the manager.
6258624	eng	Tom and Mary don't do that as much as they used to.
6258625	eng	Tom just does what he needs to do.
6258626	eng	I wish people wouldn't do that.
6258627	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't agree on what should be done.
6258628	eng	Tom isn't young enough to do that.
6258629	eng	I wish I hadn't gone to Boston.
6258630	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do what Mary told him to do.
6258631	eng	Tom isn't the only one who's busy.
6258632	eng	I wish I had been more careful.
6258633	eng	Tom admitted he did what Mary said he shouldn't do.
6258634	eng	Tom isn't teaching French anymore.
6258635	eng	I went for a walk on the beach.
6258636	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is very likely to wait for us.
6258637	eng	Tom isn't supposed to eat peanuts.
6258638	eng	I wasn't sure I should do that.
6258639	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary shouldn't do that.
6258640	eng	Tom isn't supposed to be sleeping.
6258641	eng	I wasn't sure I had to do that.
6258642	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be nervous if Mary were here.
6258643	eng	Tom isn't someone you can replace.
6258644	eng	I wasn't old enough to do that.
6258645	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary can't speak French.
6258646	eng	Tom isn't ready to do that either.
6258647	eng	I wasn't in Boston last winter.
6258648	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that for Mary.
6258649	eng	Tom isn't old enough to drive yet.
6258650	eng	I wasn't able to do that today.
6258651	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that.
6258652	eng	Tom isn't old enough to drink yet.
6258653	eng	I was too tired to do anything.
6258654	eng	I think Tom could do that for Mary if he wanted to.
6258655	eng	Tom isn't likely to be upset.
6258656	eng	I was the first one to do that.
6258657	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary had gotten married.
6258658	eng	Tom isn't likely to be tired.
6258659	eng	I was living in Boston in 2013.
6258660	eng	You knew Tom told Mary not to do that, didn't you?
6258661	eng	Tom isn't likely to be ready.
6258662	eng	I was just in Boston last week.
6258663	eng	You knew Tom had to help Mary do that, didn't you?
6258664	eng	Tom isn't likely to be first.
6258665	eng	I was hoping you could do that.
6258666	eng	Tom would've done that if Mary hadn't stopped him.
6258667	eng	Tom isn't likely to be early.
6258668	eng	I was asked to speak in French.
6258669	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't studying in her room.
6258670	eng	Tom isn't likely to be drunk.
6258671	eng	I wanted both of them to leave.
6258672	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't tell John to do that.
6258673	eng	Tom isn't likely to be bored.
6258674	eng	I want you to do that tomorrow.
6258675	eng	Tom wondered who Mary had gotten the flowers from.
6258676	eng	Tom isn't likely to be awake.
6258677	eng	I want to try to do that again.
6258678	eng	Tom wondered who Mary expected to clean the house.
6258679	eng	Tom isn't likely to be alone.
6258680	eng	I want to speak to you at 2:30.
6258681	eng	Tom wondered where Mary spent her summer vacation.
6258682	eng	Tom isn't good at speaking French.
6258683	eng	I want to speak to the manager.
6258684	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what she wants to know.
6258685	eng	Tom isn't being forced to do that.
6258686	eng	I want to learn how to do that.
6258687	eng	Tom won't be able to convince Mary not to do that.
6258688	eng	Tom isn't as old as he says he is.
6258689	eng	I want to go swimming with you.
6258690	eng	Tom will take care of Mary's dog while she's away.
6258691	eng	Tom isn't afraid to do that again.
6258692	eng	I want to go home, but I can't.
6258693	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary why he had to do that.
6258694	eng	Tom isn't able to do that tonight.
6258695	eng	I want to get home before dark.
6258696	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what she needs to buy.
6258697	eng	Tom is younger than he says he is.
6258698	eng	I want to get better at French.
6258699	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what needs to be done.
6258700	eng	Tom is working on his third album.
6258701	eng	I want to eat some pumpkin pie.
6258702	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary that he can't do that.
6258703	eng	Tom is waiting for that to happen.
6258704	eng	I want to do that, but I can't.
6258705	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to drive too fast.
6258706	eng	Tom is very stingy with his money.
6258707	eng	I want to do everything myself.
6258708	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he'll never leave her.
6258709	eng	Tom is very proud of his students.
6258710	eng	I want to buy a new smartphone.
6258711	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he intends to do that.
6258712	eng	Tom is very proud of his daughter.
6258713	eng	I want to become a voice actor.
6258714	eng	Tom wasn't the one who taught Mary how to do that.
6258715	eng	Tom is very determined to do that.
6258716	eng	I walked three miles yesterday.
6258717	eng	Tom wasn't the one who showed Mary how to do that.
6258718	eng	Tom is usually the first one here.
6258719	eng	I used to work in a restaurant.
6258720	eng	Tom was sure Mary knew she didn't need to do that.
6258721	eng	Tom is usually at home on Mondays.
6258722	eng	I used to come to Boston a lot.
6258723	eng	Tom was sure Mary knew she didn't have to do that.
6258724	eng	Tom is trying to make that happen.
6258725	eng	I try not to eat between meals.
6258726	eng	Tom was able to answer Mary's technical questions.
6258727	eng	Tom is too weak to get out of bed.
6258728	eng	I try not to complain too much.
6258729	eng	Tom warned Mary what would happen if she did that.
6258730	eng	Tom is too sick to get out of bed.
6258731	eng	I tried to make both ends meet.
6258732	eng	Tom told Mary that he was happy that she did that.
6258733	eng	Tom is too old to do that anymore.
6258734	eng	I thought you wouldn't do that.
6258735	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was unemployed.
6258736	eng	Tom is too nervous to do that now.
6258737	eng	I think you'll pass this class.
6258738	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was suspicious.
6258739	eng	Tom is too generous with his time.
6258740	eng	I think you should do that now.
6258741	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was prejudiced.
6258742	eng	Tom is the youngest of three boys.
6258743	eng	I think we should visit Boston.
6258744	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was optimistic.
6258745	eng	Tom is the youngest in his family.
6258746	eng	I think we should go to Boston.
6258747	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was interested.
6258748	eng	Tom is the third name on the list.
6258749	eng	I think that I want to do that.
6258750	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was frustrated.
6258751	eng	Tom is the shortest person I know.
6258752	eng	I think doing that would be OK.
6258753	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was frightened.
6258754	eng	Tom is the person we want to hire.
6258755	eng	I think I'd be able to do that.
6258756	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was downstairs.
6258757	eng	Tom is the only vegetarian I know.
6258758	eng	I think I should buy a new car.
6258759	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was dependable.
6258760	eng	Tom is the one who should do that.
6258761	eng	I think I can probably do that.
6258762	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was courageous.
6258763	eng	Tom is the one who has to do that.
6258764	eng	I think I can do that if I try.
6258765	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was aggressive.
6258766	eng	Tom is the one who had to do that.
6258767	eng	I taught French many years ago.
6258768	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was beautiful.
6258769	eng	Tom is the most likely to do that.
6258770	eng	I still haven't washed the car.
6258771	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was upset.
6258772	eng	Tom is the head of our department.
6258773	eng	I still haven't mowed the lawn.
6258774	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was funny.
6258775	eng	Tom is swimming with some friends.
6258776	eng	I still have a house in Boston.
6258777	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was crazy.
6258778	eng	Tom is supposed to be in his room.
6258779	eng	I signed a three-year contract.
6258780	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was brave.
6258781	eng	Tom is such an interesting person.
6258782	eng	I shouldn't need any more help.
6258783	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was bossy.
6258784	eng	Tom is still too young to do that.
6258785	eng	I shouldn't have left so early.
6258786	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was alive.
6258787	eng	Tom is still sitting on the bench.
6258788	eng	I should've refused to do that.
6258789	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't have time to do that.
6258790	eng	Tom is still reluctant to do that.
6258791	eng	I should've done that with you.
6258792	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't feel like doing that.
6258793	eng	Tom is reluctant to talk about it.
6258794	eng	I should've asked you for help.
6258795	eng	Tom told Mary it would be safe for her to do that.
6258796	eng	Tom is really good with his hands.
6258797	eng	I should try to do that, right?
6258798	eng	Tom told Mary it was dangerous for her to do that.
6258799	eng	Tom is probably alone in his room.
6258800	eng	I should never have to do that.
6258801	eng	Tom told Mary I couldn't do that without his help.
6258802	eng	Tom is probably a really nice guy.
6258803	eng	I should leave before it rains.
6258804	eng	Tom thought Mary would be the next one to do that.
6258805	eng	Tom is planning a trip in October.
6258806	eng	I should know better at my age.
6258807	eng	Tom thought Mary would be the last one to do that.
6258808	eng	Tom is old enough to travel alone.
6258809	eng	I should be allowed to do that.
6258810	eng	Tom thought Mary would be bored, but he was wrong.
6258811	eng	Tom is now taller than his mother.
6258812	eng	I really don't want to be here.
6258813	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be interested in doing that.

6259291	eng	I didn't want to be left alone.
6259292	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't going to do that.
6259293	eng	Tom had his chance and he blew it.
6259294	eng	I didn't want to be here today.
6259295	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was supposed to do that.
6259296	eng	Tom had an opportunity to do that.
6259297	eng	I didn't want my picture taken.
6259298	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary expected him to do that.
6259299	eng	Tom had a right to defend himself.
6259300	eng	I didn't want any more trouble.
6259301	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wanted to do that by herself.
6259302	eng	Tom graduated second in his class.
6259303	eng	I didn't try to hide the truth.
6259304	eng	Tom didn't know Mary needed to do that by herself.
6259305	eng	Tom got to ride a horse yesterday.
6259306	eng	I didn't think you'd be scared.
6259307	eng	Tom did everything the way Mary told him to do it.
6259308	eng	Tom got on his bike and rode away.
6259309	eng	I didn't think you'd be lonely.
6259310	eng	Tom could've done that for Mary if he'd wanted to.
6259311	eng	Tom got in his car and started it.
6259312	eng	I didn't think you were scared.
6259313	eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that Mary would do that.
6259314	eng	Tom got here thirty minutes early.
6259315	eng	I didn't think you were lonely.
6259316	eng	Tom bet me thirty dollars that Mary could do that.
6259317	eng	Tom got exactly what he asked for.
6259318	eng	I didn't think I'd get injured.
6259319	eng	Tom bet Mary thirty dollars that he could do that.
6259320	eng	Tom got behind the car and pushed.
6259321	eng	I didn't think I would be here.
6259322	eng	Tom assured Mary that they could do that together.
6259323	eng	Tom got away disguised as a woman.
6259324	eng	I didn't tell anyone who I was.
6259325	eng	Tom assured Mary that he wouldn't do that anymore.
6259326	eng	Tom got another chance to do that.
6259327	eng	I didn't read the instructions.
6259328	eng	Tom asked me if I knew how to get to Mary's house.
6259329	eng	Tom got a job as a security guard.
6259330	eng	I didn't need to do that today.
6259331	eng	Tom asked if Mary really had to do that this week.
6259332	eng	Tom goes to a school for the deaf.
6259333	eng	I didn't mind living by myself.
6259334	eng	Tom asked Mary why she thought she had to do that.
6259335	eng	Tom glanced at the weather report.
6259336	eng	I didn't mind doing the dishes.
6259337	eng	Tom asked Mary whether she liked Thai food or not.
6259338	eng	Tom gives us exactly what we need.
6259339	eng	I didn't like the way you did that.
6259340	eng	Tom asked Mary if she would mind doing that later.
6259341	eng	Tom gets up at 6:30 every morning.
6259342	eng	I didn't like living in Boston.
6259343	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really had to do that today.
6259344	eng	Tom gave me some practical advice.
6259345	eng	I didn't like Boston very much.
6259346	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really had to do that again.
6259347	eng	Tom gave me exactly what I wanted.
6259348	eng	I didn't know you were so lazy.
6259349	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that right now.
6259350	eng	Tom gave me exactly what I needed.
6259351	eng	I didn't know which one to buy.
6259352	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to walk on the beach together.
6259353	eng	Tom gave me all the help I needed.
6259354	eng	I didn't know what to say next.
6259355	eng	Tom and Mary think I don't know their parents are.
6259356	eng	Tom frequently forgets to do that.
6259357	eng	I didn't know what I should do.
6259358	eng	Tom almost forgot to tell Mary what she had to do.
6259359	eng	Tom forgot to turn off the lights.
6259360	eng	I didn't know what I had to do.
6259361	eng	Tom admitted he did what Mary asked him not to do.
6259362	eng	Tom forged his father's signature.
6259363	eng	I didn't know it was a mistake.
6259364	eng	There's no reason Tom needs to know what Mary did.
6259365	eng	Tom felt he had to say something.
6259366	eng	I didn't know how I could help.
6259367	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is supposed to be doing that.
6259368	eng	Tom feels that he's ready to play.
6259369	eng	I didn't know I should do that.
6259370	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary wants to do that.
6259371	eng	Tom expressed his dissatisfaction.
6259372	eng	I didn't know I had to do that.
6259373	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
6259374	eng	Tom explained what had to be done.
6259375	eng	I didn't intend to hurt anyone.
6259376	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary isn't very happy here.
6259377	eng	Tom explained the situation to us.
6259378	eng	I didn't hear the rooster crow.
6259379	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that with Mary.
6259380	eng	Tom eventually wound up in Boston.
6259381	eng	I didn't have to do that alone.
6259382	eng	I think Tom isn't sure that's what Mary has to do.
6259383	eng	Tom eventually decided to do that.
6259384	eng	I didn't have to come so early.
6259385	eng	I think Tom could've stopped Mary from doing that.
6259386	eng	Tom encouraged me to study French.
6259387	eng	I didn't have my phone with me.
6259388	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary had to do that.
6259389	eng	Tom earns his living as a teacher.
6259390	eng	I didn't have much of a choice.
6259391	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary didn't do that.
6259392	eng	Tom earns about $300,000 annually.
6259393	eng	I didn't have much money on me.
6259394	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't want Mary to do that.
6259395	eng	Tom drowned in his pool last week.
6259396	eng	I didn't have anything to read.
6259397	eng	I don't know what Tom and Mary were arguing about.
6259398	eng	Tom drove himself to the hospital.
6259399	eng	I didn't go shopping yesterday.
6259400	eng	I didn't think Tom needed to tell Mary what to do.
6259401	eng	Tom dried his clothes by the fire.
6259402	eng	I didn't get to school in time.
6259403	eng	I didn't know Tom until Mary introduced him to me.
6259405	eng	I didn't feel up to doing that.
6259406	eng	Fortunately, Tom didn't see Mary and John kissing.
6259407	eng	Tom doesn't want to go to college.
6259408	eng	I didn't feel that I was ready.
6259409	eng	Didn't you know that Tom and I are Mary's parents?
6259410	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that today.
6259411	eng	I didn't expect to get a raise.
6259412	eng	Didn't you know Tom was living with Mary's family?
6259413	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that again.
6259414	eng	I didn't expect this to happen.
6259415	eng	Didn't you know Tom and John were Mary's brothers?
6259416	eng	Tom doesn't trust doctors anymore.
6259417	eng	I didn't do what you say I did.
6259418	eng	Didn't you know Mary and Alice were Tom's sisters?
6259419	eng	Tom doesn't think you can do that.
6259420	eng	I didn't do that for very long.
6259421	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary are John's grandparents?
6259422	eng	Tom doesn't think I would do that.
6259423	eng	I didn't do so well on my test.
6259424	eng	You should tell Tom Mary doesn't want to do that.
6259425	eng	Tom doesn't think I could do that.
6259426	eng	I didn't ask for your opinions.
6259427	eng	You should tell Tom Mary doesn't need to do that.
6259428	eng	Tom doesn't still want to do that.
6259429	eng	I didn't ask even one question.
6259430	eng	You should tell Tom Mary doesn't have to do that.
6259431	eng	Tom doesn't still need to do that.
6259432	eng	I didn't actually see anything.
6259433	eng	Tom would've been better at doing that than Mary.
6259434	eng	Tom doesn't still have to do that.
6259435	eng	I didn't actually do that much.
6259436	eng	Tom would be disappointed if Mary didn't do that.
6259437	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be very upset.
6259438	eng	I didn't actually believe that.
6259439	vie	Không một sinh viên nào tới đúng giờ.
6259440	vie	Hôm nay là một ngày trọng đại
6259441	vie	Mình nghĩ cậu thích cô ấy.
6259442	vie	Tớ vẫn chưa gọi lại cho họ.
6259443	eng	Tom wondered who Mary had bought the necktie for.
6259444	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be very angry.
6259445	eng	I didn't accept the invitation.
6259446	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary why he had to do that.
6259447	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be busy today.
6259448	eng	I did that because I wanted to.
6259449	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what she needs to buy.
6259450	eng	Tom doesn't really need the money.
6259451	eng	I did that as often as I could.
6259452	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what needs to be done.
6259453	eng	Tom doesn't quite see it that way.
6259454	eng	I could've bought that for you.
6259455	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he intends to do that.
6259456	eng	Tom doesn't plan to go to college.
6259457	eng	I could go home if I wanted to.
6259458	eng	Tom won't be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6259459	eng	Tom doesn't need to prove himself.
6259460	eng	I could get hurt if I did that.
6259461	eng	Tom won't be able to do that without Mary's help.
6259462	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that again.
6259463	eng	I can't very well do that here.
6259464	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what she needs to do.
6259465	eng	Tom doesn't make me laugh anymore.
6259466	eng	I can't speak very much French.
6259467	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he wants to eat.
6259468	eng	Tom doesn't look worried about it.
6259469	eng	I can't go to Boston next week.
6259470	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he wants to buy.
6259471	eng	Tom doesn't look very happy to me.
6259472	eng	I can't find anyone to help me.
6259473	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he needs to buy.
6259474	eng	Tom doesn't look like he's lonely.
6259475	eng	I can't find Boston on the map.
6259476	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to be frightened.
6259477	eng	Tom doesn't look happy to see you.
6259478	eng	I can do that without any help.
6259479	eng	Tom wasn't convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
6259480	eng	Tom doesn't like the way you sing.
6259481	eng	I can come to Boston next week.
6259482	eng	Tom wasn't convinced that Mary needed to do that.
6259483	eng	Tom doesn't like the way you cook.
6259484	eng	I can be in Boston next Monday.
6259485	eng	Tom was hoping he could persuade Mary to do that.
6259486	eng	Tom doesn't like that idea at all.
6259487	eng	I brought you a glass of water.
6259488	eng	Tom wanted to be gone by the time Mary got there.
6259489	eng	Tom doesn't like being unemployed.
6259490	eng	I assumed you wouldn't do that.
6259491	eng	Tom tried to apologize, but Mary wouldn't listen.
6259492	eng	Tom doesn't know why you did that.
6259493	eng	How was your dinner last night?
6259494	eng	Tom told me you're a better drummer than Mary is.
6259495	eng	Tom doesn't know where he belongs.
6259496	eng	How often do you go to the zoo?
6259497	eng	Tom told me that Mary has decided not to do that.
6259498	eng	Tom doesn't know much about birds.
6259499	eng	How often do you go to parties?
6259500	eng	Tom told Mary that she's forgiven for doing that.
6259501	eng	Tom doesn't know how to play jazz.
6259502	eng	How often do you go to museums?
6259503	eng	Tom told Mary that she needed to be more careful.
6259504	eng	Tom doesn't have to live this way.
6259505	eng	How often do you get headaches?
6259506	eng	Tom told Mary that he was in Boston last weekend.
6259507	eng	Tom doesn't have his phone on him.
6259508	eng	How much longer should we wait?
6259509	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was terrified.
6259510	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends here.
6259511	eng	How are we supposed to do that?
6259512	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was surprised.
6259513	eng	Tom doesn't have a home right now.
6259514	eng	Have you already paid the bill?
6259515	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was skeptical.
6259516	eng	Tom doesn't ever get here on time.
6259517	eng	Have any of you ever done that?
6259518	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was in Boston.
6259519	eng	Tom doesn't even know how to swim.
6259520	eng	Hang your jacket in the closet.
6259521	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was impressed.
6259522	eng	Tom doesn't enjoy teaching French.
6259523	eng	Even if it rains, I'll do that.
6259524	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was impatient.
6259525	eng	Tom doesn't enjoy giving speeches.
6259526	eng	Don't you still work in Boston?
6259527	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was dishonest.
6259528	eng	Tom doesn't do that kind of thing.
6259529	eng	Don't you feel like doing that?
6259530	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was disgusted.
6259531	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be too busy.
6259532	eng	Don't we have to do that today?
6259533	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was desperate.
6259534	eng	Tom does want to go on to college.
6259535	eng	Don't do that until after 2:30.
6259536	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was depressed.
6259537	eng	Tom does that even when he's sick.
6259538	eng	Doing that would make me happy.
6259539	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was dangerous.
6259540	eng	Tom does that because he wants to.
6259541	eng	Doing that would be very scary.
6259542	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was courteous.
6259543	eng	Tom does that because he likes to.
6259544	eng	Doing that would be ridiculous.
6259545	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was confident.
6259546	eng	Tom does nothing all day but read.
6259547	eng	Doing that will be very tiring.
6259548	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was conceited.
6259549	eng	Tom does everything the right way.
6259550	eng	Doing that was very innovative.
6259551	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had gone home.
6259552	eng	Tom does almost everything for me.
6259553	eng	Doing that likely won't be fun.
6259554	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had done that.
6259555	eng	Tom does a good job with the team.
6259556	eng	Doing that is healthy exercise.
6259557	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John had been late.
6259558	eng	Tom died with a smile on his face.
6259559	eng	Do you regret having done that?
6259560	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John could do that.
6259561	eng	Tom died of a heart attack Monday.
6259562	eng	Do you really enjoy doing that?
6259563	eng	Tom told Mary that he had decided not to do that.
6259564	eng	Tom died in Boston of lung cancer.
6259565	eng	Do you mind if I use your bike?
6259566	eng	Tom told Mary that he had a lot of fun in Boston.
6259567	eng	Tom died in 2013 of liver failure.
6259568	eng	Do you mind if I don't do that?
6259569	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was slow.
6259570	eng	Tom died in 2013 at the age of 30.
6259571	eng	Do you mean you didn't do that?
6259572	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was dead.
6259573	eng	Tom died an extremely wealthy man.
6259574	eng	Do you live with your daughter?
6259575	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't know how to do that.
6259576	eng	Tom didn't want to wait that long.
6259577	eng	Do you intend to do that today?
6259578	eng	Tom told Mary that John was a good friend of his.
6259579	eng	Tom didn't want to do it that way.
6259580	eng	Do you intend to do that again?
6259581	eng	Tom told Mary she should do that, but she didn't.
6259582	eng	Tom didn't think we could do that.
6259583	eng	Do you feel safe in your house?
6259584	eng	Tom told Mary she could do that if she wanted to.
6259585	eng	Tom didn't think it was a problem.
6259586	eng	Do you ever take vitamin pills?
6259587	eng	Tom told Mary not to forget to water the flowers.
6259588	eng	Tom didn't study French yesterday.
6259589	eng	Do you always do your homework?
6259591	eng	Tom didn't study French last year.
6259592	eng	Do we all need to study French?
6259593	eng	Tom told Mary it would be fun for her to do that.
6259594	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who I was.
6259595	eng	Do we all have to study French?
6259596	eng	Tom told Mary he'd never do anything to hurt her.
6259597	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very sleepy.
6259598	eng	Didn't you know that was there?
6259599	eng	Tom thought he wouldn't be able to cheer Mary up.
6259600	eng	Tom didn't seem to be discouraged.
6259601	eng	Didn't you know it was snowing?
6259602	eng	Tom thought Mary would be awake when he got home.
6259603	eng	Tom didn't say who should do that.
6259604	eng	Didn't you know it was raining?
6259605	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't interested in doing that.
6259606	eng	Tom didn't really want to do that.
6259607	eng	Didn't I tell you not to worry?
6259608	eng	Tom thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
6259609	eng	Tom didn't really need to do that.
6259610	eng	Did you speak French yesterday?
6259611	eng	Tom thought Mary was difficult to get along with.
6259612	eng	Tom didn't really have to do that.
6259613	eng	Did you put sugar in my coffee?
6259614	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be the next one to do that.
6259615	eng	Tom didn't need to wait very long.
6259616	eng	Did you know you could do that?
6259617	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be the last one to do that.
6259618	eng	Tom didn't need to wait that long.
6259619	eng	Did you know that would happen?
6259620	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be awake when he gets home.
6259621	eng	Tom didn't look like he was tired.
6259622	eng	Did you go somewhere yesterday?
6259623	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be the first one to do that.
6259624	eng	Tom didn't look like he was happy.
6259625	eng	Did you buy yourself a new car?
6259626	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be interested in doing that.
6259627	eng	Tom didn't know anything about it.
6259628	eng	Could you open the gate for me?
6259629	eng	Tom stood up and went to the door to let Mary in.
6259630	eng	Tom didn't know about the meeting.
6259631	eng	Could you help me tie my shoes?
6259632	eng	Tom still doesn't know why Mary wants to do that.
6259633	eng	Tom didn't have to wait that long.
6259634	eng	Can you be in Boston on Monday?
6259635	eng	Tom still doesn't know why Mary needs to do that.
6259636	eng	Tom didn't have a good day either.
6259637	eng	Boston is a nice place to live.
6259638	eng	Tom spends a lot of money buying things for Mary.
6259639	eng	Tom didn't give any other details.
6259640	eng	Boston is a good place to live.
6259641	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary he wants to quit his job.
6259642	eng	Tom didn't give a specific reason.
6259643	eng	Are your parents still married?
6259644	eng	Tom should've married Mary instead of her sister.
6259645	eng	Tom didn't feel sorry for himself.
6259646	eng	Are you sure I need to do that?
6259647	eng	Tom should've done that the way Mary told him to.
6259648	eng	Tom didn't expect to fall in love.
6259649	eng	Are you sure I have to do that?
6259650	eng	Tom should tell Mary only what she needs to know.
6259651	eng	Tom didn't do what you say he did.
6259652	eng	Are you still a violin teacher?
6259653	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what she has to do.
6259655	eng	Are you going to work tomorrow?
6259656	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what he has to buy.
6259657	eng	Tom didn't appear to be too tired.
6259658	eng	Are you going to do that alone?
6259659	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary to stop doing that.
6259660	eng	Tom didn't appear to be too happy.
6259661	eng	Are you determined to go there?
6259662	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary to quit doing that.
6259663	eng	Tom did what he had planned to do.
6259664	eng	All of us want to visit Boston.
6259665	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary to do that for him.
6259666	eng	Tom did what he felt he had to do.
6259667	eng	All of us want to study French.
6259668	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to be so noisy.
6259669	eng	Tom did that without any problems.
6259670	eng	All of us want to go to Boston.
6259671	eng	Tom should let Mary study French if she wants to.
6259672	eng	Tom did that very fast, didn't he?
6259673	eng	A wise person wouldn't do that.
6259674	eng	Tom seemed to want to do that more than Mary did.
6259675	eng	Tom did that pretty well, I think.
6259676	eng	Yours is a blue bag, isn't it?
6259677	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary had to do that.
6259678	eng	Tom did that by himself yesterday.
6259679	eng	Your technique is interesting.
6259680	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary didn't do that.
6259681	eng	Tom did that as often as he could.
6259682	eng	Your room needs to be cleaned.
6259683	eng	Tom seemed convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
6259684	eng	Tom devoted his life to education.
6259685	eng	Your predictions were correct.
6259686	eng	Tom seemed convinced that Mary needed to do that.
6259687	eng	Tom definitely deserves the award.
6259688	eng	Your name was never mentioned.
6259689	eng	Tom says that Mary isn't very good at doing that.
6259690	eng	Tom decided to go a different way.
6259691	eng	Your handshake is very strong.
6259692	eng	Tom says if Mary doesn't do that, he'll be angry.
6259693	eng	Tom decided that I should do that.
6259694	eng	Your guitar playing isn't bad.
6259695	eng	Tom says he knows Mary will eventually leave him.
6259696	eng	Tom cut three meters off the rope.
6259697	eng	Your fingers are really short.
6259698	eng	Tom says he just couldn't permit Mary to do that.
6259699	eng	Tom currently resides near Boston.
6259700	eng	Your French is almost perfect.
6259701	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't want him to do that.
6259702	eng	Tom currently owns three vehicles.
6259703	eng	Your French has gotten better.
6259704	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't tell him to do that.
6259705	eng	Tom cried when he heard the story.
6259706	eng	You've got a really big mouth.
6259707	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary will be able to do that, too.
6259708	eng	Tom couldn't force you to do that.
6259709	eng	You've already drunk too much.
6259710	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who to give that to.
6259711	eng	Tom could've done that on his own.
6259712	eng	You're the richest man I know.
6259713	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who to ask for help.
6259714	eng	Tom could've done that by himself.
6259715	eng	You're the richest guy I know.
6259716	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't refuse to do that.
6259717	eng	Tom could've been more supportive.
6259718	eng	You're the only one I've told.
6259719	eng	Tom says he heard Mary was pretty good at French.
6259720	eng	Tom could stop us from doing that.
6259721	eng	You're the one I want to meet.
6259722	eng	Tom says he hasn't seen Mary since they broke up.
6259723	eng	Tom could stop me from doing that.
6259724	eng	You're suspicious, aren't you?
6259725	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to ask Mary to help him.
6259726	eng	Tom could get hurt if he did that.
6259727	eng	You're not too old to do that.
6259728	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary wanted to do that.
6259729	eng	Tom could do that if he wanted to.
6259730	eng	You're colorblind, aren't you?
6259731	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary needed to do that.
6259732	eng	Tom could be skeptical about that.
6259733	eng	You're acting like a big baby.
6259734	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary went to Boston.
6259735	eng	Tom could be reluctant to do that.
6259736	eng	You're a very talented person.
6259737	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary has to do that.
6259738	eng	Tom could be motivated to do that.
6259739	eng	You're a very generous person.
6259740	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really did that.
6259741	eng	Tom could be doing that right now.
6259742	eng	You're a very creative person.
6259743	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wanted to eat pizza.
6259744	eng	Tom could be desperate to do that.
6259745	eng	You're a really good listener.
6259746	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary helped John do that.
6259747	eng	Tom could be charged with perjury.
6259748	eng	You're a lot taller than I am.
6259749	eng	Tom says he and Mary are planning to get married.
6259750	eng	Tom could be a very rich man soon.
6259751	eng	You're a lot like your father.
6259752	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John really did that.
6259753	eng	Tom continued talking for a while.
6259754	eng	You're a good football player.
6259755	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John would do that.
6259756	eng	Tom certainly won't do that again.
6259757	eng	You're a busy man, aren't you?
6259758	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't believe John could do that.
6259759	eng	Tom certainly wasn't ready for it.
6259760	eng	You're a bit taller than I am.
6259761	eng	Tom said that he couldn't wait to see Mary again.
6259762	eng	Tom can't solve the problem alone.
6259763	eng	You're a bit like your father.
6259764	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't going to do that today.
6259765	eng	Tom can't know the answer to that.
6259766	eng	You'll be too busy to do that.
6259767	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to talk to the manager.
6259768	eng	Tom can still do that pretty well.
6259769	eng	You'd better not do that here.
6259770	eng	Tom said that Mary thought John was good-looking.
6259771	eng	Tom can do that without your help.
6259772	eng	You'd better do that tomorrow.
6259773	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be enjoying herself.
6259774	eng	Tom can do that wherever he wants.
6259775	eng	You suggested that we do that.
6259776	eng	Tom said that Mary really did do that by herself.
6259777	eng	Tom can do that anywhere he wants.
6259778	eng	You shouldn't do that so much.
6259779	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to talk to the manager.
6259780	eng	Tom came in just as I was leaving.
6259781	eng	You should've been doing that.
6259782	eng	Tom said that Mary has been sick in bed all week.
6259783	eng	Tom built a trap to catch rabbits.
6259784	eng	You should do that more often.
6259785	eng	Tom said that Mary and John are also his friends.
6259786	eng	Tom begged me to help him do that.
6259787	eng	You should definitely do that.
6259788	eng	Tom said it was him who should help Mary do that.
6259789	eng	Tom baked some brownies yesterday.
6259790	eng	You should be able to do that.
6259791	eng	Tom said it was Mary who borrowed his sunglasses.
6259792	eng	Tom asked us why we had done that.
6259793	eng	You seemed to want to do that.
6259794	eng	Tom said he'd expected Mary to do that yesterday.
6259795	eng	Tom asked me why I studied French.
6259796	eng	You seemed a little surprised.
6259797	eng	Tom said he'd expected Mary to do that on Monday.
6259798	eng	Tom asked me to pass him the salt.
6259799	eng	You seem unwilling to do that.
6259800	eng	Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that anymore.
6259801	eng	Tom asked me to come to his house.
6259802	eng	You seem to know who did that.
6259803	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to John and Mary's wedding.
6259804	eng	Tom asked me not to do that again.
6259805	eng	You seem full of energy today.
6259806	eng	Tom said he wasn't expecting Mary to help him.
6259807	eng	Tom asked me if I knew how to sew.
6259808	eng	You seem a little embarrassed.
6259809	eng	Tom said he wasn't expecting Mary to be there.
6259810	eng	Tom asked if he needed to do that.
6259811	eng	You said you'd do that for us.
6259812	eng	Tom said he wasn't aware that Mary had done that.
6259813	eng	Tom answered no to both questions.
6259814	eng	You said you'd do that for me.
6259815	eng	Tom said he wanted to visit Mary in the hospital.
6259816	eng	Tom answered all of our questions.
6259817	eng	You really do need to do that.
6259818	eng	Tom said he wanted to go to Boston to visit Mary.
6259819	eng	Tom and his staff can manage that.
6259820	eng	You really do have to do that.
6259821	eng	Tom said he tried to help Mary with her homework.
6259822	eng	Tom and I've gotten back together.
6259823	eng	You offered to do that for us.
6259824	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to do that.
6259825	eng	Tom and I'll leave this afternoon.
6259826	eng	You need to wait a bit longer.
6259827	eng	Tom said he thinks Mary won't be able to do that.
6259828	eng	Tom and I'd like to be left alone.
6259829	eng	You need to do that right now.
6259830	eng	Tom said he saw Mary playing badminton with John.
6259831	eng	Tom and I worked out our problems.
6259832	eng	You need to do that carefully.
6259833	eng	Tom said he saw Mary and John kissing each other.
6259834	eng	Tom and I work very well together.
6259835	eng	You might die if you eat that.
6259836	eng	Tom said he knew why Mary wasn't able to do that.
6259837	eng	Tom and I weren't sure what to do.
6259838	eng	You may as well do that today.
6259839	eng	Tom said he knew what Mary thought she should do.
6259840	eng	Tom and I weren't happy in Boston.
6259841	eng	You lost your key, didn't you?
6259842	eng	Tom said he hopes Mary won't be late again today.
6259843	eng	Tom and I weren't able to do that.
6259844	eng	You look like you're thinking.
6259845	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would come to his concert.
6259846	eng	Tom and I were too tired to fight.
6259847	eng	You look like you just got up.
6259848	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wanted to do that.
6259849	eng	Tom and I were the only survivors.
6259850	eng	You look like you belong here.
6259851	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary needed to do that.
6259852	eng	Tom and I were married in October.
6259853	eng	You look like a weight lifter.
6259854	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary enjoys doing that.
6259855	eng	Tom and I were downtown yesterday.
6259856	eng	You look like a tired old man.
6259857	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary does that anymore.
6259858	eng	Tom and I went to church together.
6259859	eng	You look as if you're in pain.
6259860	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would've done that.
6259861	eng	Tom and I went to Boston together.
6259862	eng	You live in Boston, don't you?
6259863	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever done that.
6259864	eng	Tom and I wanted to be left alone.
6259865	eng	You know I can't speak French.
6259866	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
6259867	eng	Tom and I used to go out together.
6259868	eng	You have to do that right now.
6259869	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary could've done that.
6259870	eng	Tom and I used to be good friends.
6259871	eng	You felt repulsed, didn't you?
6259872	eng	Tom said Mary would probably know how to do that.
6259873	eng	Tom and I sat together on the bus.
6259874	eng	You fed the sheep, didn't you?
6259875	eng	Tom said Mary would likely go to Boston with him.
6259876	eng	Tom and I sat opposite each other.
6259877	eng	You don't like school, do you?
6259878	eng	Tom said Mary will probably still be cooperative.
6259879	eng	Tom and I relax in different ways.
6259880	eng	You don't have a cold, do you?
6259881	eng	Tom said Mary went to a movie with him last week.
6259882	eng	Tom and I often hang out together.
6259883	vie	Tom hiếm khi phàn nàn về bất cứ thứ gì.
6259884	eng	You didn't tell me to do that.
6259885	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't amused by what was going on.
6259886	eng	Tom and I often do the same thing.
6259887	eng	You did that better this time.
6259888	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help John do that.
6259889	eng	Tom and I often did that together.
6259890	eng	You designed this, didn't you?
6259891	eng	Tom said Mary was too drunk to help John do that.
6259892	eng	Tom and I often argue about money.
6259893	eng	You could've done that better.
6259894	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be unconvinced.
6259895	eng	Tom and I live on the same street.
6259896	eng	You ate something, didn't you?
6259897	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be pessimistic.
6259898	eng	Tom and I left the party together.
6259899	eng	You ate breakfast, didn't you?
6259900	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be intoxicated.
6259901	eng	Tom and I have everything we want.
6259902	eng	You agreed to help us do that.
6259903	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping she could cheer John up.
6259904	eng	Tom and I have everything we need.
6259905	eng	Would you please wait a while?
6259906	eng	Tom said Mary was glad that you did that for him.
6259907	eng	Tom and I have both taught French.
6259908	eng	Would you like to be a lawyer?
6259909	eng	Tom said Mary was asleep by the time he got home.
6259910	eng	Tom and I had to change our plans.
6259911	eng	Would you like some beer, too?
6259912	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might want to do that.
6259913	eng	Tom and I got married this winter.
6259914	eng	Would you be happy to do that?
6259915	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might need to do that.
6259916	eng	Tom and I got married last winter.
6259917	eng	Would you allow me to do that?
6259918	eng	Tom said Mary thought John might have to do that.
6259919	eng	Tom and I go to the same hospital.
6259920	eng	Would you all please be quiet?
6259921	eng	Tom said Mary should've gone to Boston with John.
6259922	eng	Tom and I flew to Boston together.
6259923	eng	Would it be OK not to do that?
6259924	eng	Tom said Mary ought to do that in the other room.
6259925	eng	Tom and I exchanged phone numbers.
6259926	eng	Will you please shut the gate?
6259927	eng	Tom said Mary only does that if John is watching.
6259928	eng	Tom and I enjoy swimming together.
6259929	eng	Will you please do that again?
6259930	eng	Tom said Mary needs to do that before she leaves.
6259931	eng	Tom and I each took a sip of wine.
6259932	eng	Will you or won't you do that?
6259933	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not need to do that.
6259934	eng	Tom and I do many things together.
6259935	eng	Will you have time to do that?
6259936	eng	Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that.
6259937	eng	Tom and I did everything we could.
6259938	eng	Will you go to the bank today?
6259939	eng	Tom said Mary has done that several times before.
6259940	eng	Tom and I did everything together.
6259941	eng	Will you do that or won't you?
6259942	eng	Tom said Mary has been trying to do that all day.
6259943	eng	Tom and I come from the same town.
6259944	eng	Will you do that now or later?
6259945	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that as soon as possible.
6259946	eng	Tom and I ate meatloaf for dinner.
6259947	eng	Will you be free this evening?
6259948	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will like Alice.
6259949	eng	Tom and I aren't together anymore.
6259950	eng	Why would you have to do that?
6259951	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to write with.
6259952	eng	Tom and I aren't going to do that.
6259953	eng	Why shouldn't we speak French?
6259954	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything she had to do.
6259955	eng	Tom and I are waiting for the bus.
6259956	eng	Why shouldn't we go to Boston?
6259957	eng	Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary about what we did.
6259958	eng	Tom and I are very happy together.
6259959	eng	Why shouldn't we be in Boston?
6259960	eng	Tom reminded Mary that she had a meeting at 2:30.
6259961	eng	Tom and I are unlikely to do that.
6259962	eng	Why don't you shut the window?
6259963	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is still here.
6259964	eng	Tom and I are really good friends.
6259965	eng	Why don't you have to do that?
6259966	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is doing that.
6259967	eng	Tom and I are good for each other.
6259968	eng	Why don't we do that together?
6259969	eng	Tom never forgets to tell Mary that he loves her.
6259970	eng	Tom and I agreed to keep in touch.
6259971	eng	Why do I need to study French?
6259972	eng	Tom needs to make sure that Mary doesn't do that.
6259973	eng	Tom always seems to be reasonable.
6259974	eng	Why do I need to speak French?
6259975	eng	Tom needs to be gone by the time Mary gets there.
6259976	eng	Tom always seems to be interested.
6259977	eng	Why do I need to go to Boston?
6259978	eng	Tom must've thought Mary wasn't going to do that.
6259979	eng	Tom always seems to be doing that.
6259980	eng	Why do I need to be in Boston?
6259982	eng	Tom always eats fruit for dessert.
6259983	eng	Why do I have to speak French?
6259984	eng	Tom made a bet with Mary that John would do that.
6259985	eng	Tom always asks the same question.
6259986	eng	Why do I have to go to Boston?
6259987	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said he didn't love her.
6259988	eng	Tom already plans to study French.
6259989	eng	Why do I have to be in Boston?
6259990	eng	Tom laughed when Mary sat down to play the piano.
6259991	eng	Tom almost always drives too fast.
6259992	eng	Why did you do that yesterday?
6259993	eng	Tom knows it wasn't the first time Mary did that.
6259994	eng	Tom agreed that we should do that.
6259995	eng	Why aren't you doing that yet?
6259996	eng	Tom knows he's not supposed to help Mary do that.
6259997	eng	Tom admitted he wanted to do that.
6259998	eng	Why aren't you doing that now?
6259999	eng	Tom isn't going to be very happy if Mary is late.
6260000	eng	Tom's truck got stuck in the mud.
6260001	eng	Why are you digging this hole?
6260002	eng	Tom is sure Mary knows she's supposed to do that.
6260003	eng	Tom's troubles are far from over.
6260004	eng	Who's the person who did that?
6260005	eng	Tom is sure Mary knew she didn't need to do that.
6260006	eng	Tom's problems are far from over.
6260007	eng	Who told you I had to do that?
6260008	eng	Tom is sure Mary knew she didn't have to do that.
6260009	eng	Tom's license has been suspended.
6260010	eng	Who did you receive that from?
6260011	eng	Tom is still waiting for Mary to do that for him.
6260012	eng	Tom's legal troubles aren't over.
6260013	eng	Which wine do you like better?
6260014	eng	Tom has told Mary that she's required to do that.
6260015	eng	Tom's friends wanted to help him.
6260016	eng	When should we come to Boston?
6260017	eng	Tom has told Mary she should wear safety glasses.
6260018	eng	Tom's first wife was from Boston.
6260019	eng	When do you intend to do that?
6260020	eng	Tom has been waiting for Mary to do that for him.
6260021	eng	Tom's brothers are still in jail.
6260022	eng	When do you expect to do that?
6260023	eng	Tom has been teaching Mary how to play the piano.
6260024	eng	Tom's brothers are still at home.
6260025	eng	When did you start doing that?
6260026	eng	Tom freaked out when he heard what Mary had done.
6260027	eng	Tom wouldn't let me speak French.
6260028	eng	When did you begin doing that?
6260029	eng	Tom finally managed to persuade Mary to help him.
6260030	eng	Tom would never make you do that.
6260031	eng	What's the name of this movie?
6260032	eng	Tom doesn't want to know why Mary didn't do that.
6260033	eng	Tom would never do that that way.
6260034	eng	What's the last thing you ate?
6260035	eng	Tom doesn't think you should ask Mary to do that.
6260036	eng	Tom would do that if he knew how.
6260037	eng	What's the harm in doing that?
6260038	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be quiet doing that.
6260039	eng	Tom would be cute if he did that.
6260040	eng	What's Boston most famous for?
6260041	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be happy doing that.
6260042	eng	Tom would be awful at doing that.
6260043	eng	What's Australia's population?
6260044	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would allow me to do that.
6260045	eng	Tom works as a used car salesman.
6260046	eng	What'll we do if it's raining?
6260047	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will permit me to do that.
6260048	eng	Tom won't need to wait very long.
6260049	eng	What kind of cake do you like?
6260050	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will allow him to do that.
6260051	eng	Tom won't likely be here on time.
6260052	eng	Were you the one who did that?
6260053	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6260054	eng	Tom won't likely be here by 2:30.
6260055	eng	Were you in Boston in October?
6260056	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary can do that or not.
6260057	eng	Tom won't likely be found guilty.
6260058	eng	Were you doing that yesterday?
6260059	eng	Tom doesn't know if Mary wants to do that or not.
6260060	eng	Tom won't let me speak French.
6260061	eng	We've done that several times.
6260062	eng	Tom doesn't have as much experience as Mary does.
6260063	eng	Tom won't have to wait very long.
6260064	eng	We've decided to visit Boston.
6260065	eng	Tom does that the way Mary taught him to do that.
6260066	eng	Tom won't go to camp this summer.
6260067	eng	We've decided to study French.
6260068	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he wouldn't be at her party.
6260069	eng	Tom won't do that for me anymore.
6260070	eng	We've decided to leave Boston.
6260071	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he didn't intend to do that.
6260072	eng	Tom won't do anything by himself.
6260073	eng	We've been ordered to do that.
6260074	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was swimming or not.
6260075	eng	Tom won't be too busy to do that.
6260076	eng	We've been asked not to leave.
6260077	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was thinking of going.
6260078	eng	Tom won't be hesitant to do that.
6260079	eng	We're coming up to a tollgate.
6260080	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't able to do that.
6260081	eng	Tom won't be done doing that yet.
6260082	eng	We'd better not do that today.
6260083	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's grandmother.
6260084	eng	Tom won't actually be doing that.
6260085	eng	We were just about to do that.
6260086	eng	Tom didn't know how long he should wait for Mary.
6260087	eng	Tom won three successive matches.
6260088	eng	We shouldn't be in Boston now.
6260089	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was good at speaking French.
6260090	eng	Tom will probably become violent.
6260091	eng	We should all be at the beach.
6260092	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
6260093	eng	Tom will probably be unimpressed.
6260094	eng	We really should visit Boston.
6260095	eng	Tom didn't know Mary needed to do that yesterday.
6260096	eng	Tom will probably be sympathetic.
6260097	eng	We never speak French anymore.
6260098	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't have time to do that.
6260099	eng	Tom will probably be pessimistic.
6260100	eng	We never go to Boston anymore.
6260101	eng	Tom couldn't talk Mary out of going to the party.
6260102	eng	Tom will probably be discouraged.
6260103	eng	We need to hire three welders.
6260104	eng	Tom committed suicide three days after Mary died.
6260105	eng	Tom will probably be cooperative.
6260106	eng	We just did that this morning.
6260107	eng	Tom asked if Mary was really required to do that.
6260108	eng	Tom will likely be in Boston now.
6260109	eng	We hope you visit Boston soon.
6260110	eng	Tom asked Mary what time she usually went to bed.
6260111	eng	Tom will likely be grouchy today.
6260112	eng	We hope that you visit Boston.
6260113	eng	Tom and Mary have decided never to do that again.
6260114	eng	Tom will likely be busy tomorrow.
6260115	eng	We haven't visited Boston yet.
6260116	eng	Tom and Mary don't fight as much as they used to.
6260117	eng	Tom will likely agree to do that.
6260118	eng	We haven't been to Boston yet.
6260119	eng	Tom and Mary are still not talking to each other.
6260120	eng	Tom will do that without my help.
6260121	eng	We have you to do that for us.
6260122	eng	Tom and Mary are still going out with each other.
6260123	eng	Tom will do that in a day or two.
6260124	eng	We have plans to visit Boston.
6260125	eng	Tom admitted he did what Mary told him not to do.
6260126	eng	Tom will be reluctant to do that.
6260127	eng	We have plans to go to Boston.
6260128	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know how to get a hold of Mary.
6260129	eng	Tom will be motivated to do that.
6260130	eng	We had enough time to do that.
6260131	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know how Mary feels about that.
6260132	eng	Tom will be fined for doing that.
6260133	eng	We don't want to study French.
6260134	eng	Mary and Alice both used to be Tom's girlfriends.
6260135	eng	Tom will be desperate to do that.
6260136	eng	We don't want to go to Boston.
6260137	eng	I'm sure Tom would be surprised if Mary did that.
6260138	eng	Tom will be back in a day or two.
6260139	eng	We don't need to go to Boston.
6260140	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
6260141	eng	Tom will be able to do that, too.
6260142	eng	We don't have to study French.
6260143	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary needs to do that.
6260144	eng	Tom wasn't sure he could do that.
6260145	eng	We don't have to speak French.
6260146	eng	I wonder if Tom knew that Mary wanted to do that.
6260147	eng	Tom wasn't scared to do anything.
6260148	eng	We don't have to go to Boston.
6260149	eng	I wonder if Tom knew that Mary needed to do that.
6260150	eng	Tom wasn't able to do that today.
6260151	eng	We don't have to decide today.
6260152	eng	I wish I hadn't told Tom to tell Mary to do that.
6260153	eng	Tom was very hesitant to do that.
6260154	eng	We don't go to Boston anymore.
6260155	eng	I want to marry Tom and Mary's youngest daughter.
6260156	eng	Tom was too terrified to do that.
6260157	eng	We divided the profit equally.
6260158	eng	I told Tom I wanted Mary to learn how to do that.
6260159	eng	Tom was told he couldn't do that.
6260160	eng	We didn't need to be so early.
6260161	eng	I thought Tom wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
6260162	eng	Tom was the only person punished.
6260163	eng	We come to Boston once a week.
6260164	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be lonely if Mary were here.
6260165	eng	Tom was the only person arrested.
6260166	eng	We caught a lot of fish today.
6260167	eng	I think Tom is sure that's what Mary wants to do.
6260168	eng	Tom was the first one to go home.
6260169	eng	We can't ignore these reports.
6260170	eng	I think Tom is sure that's what Mary needs to do.
6260171	eng	Tom was on television last night.
6260172	eng	We can never be friends again.
6260173	eng	I think Tom couldn't have done that without Mary.
6260174	eng	Tom was my coach for three years.
6260175	eng	This won't affect my decision.
6260176	eng	I think Tom and Mary are in love with each other.
6260177	eng	Tom was is in the passenger seat.
6260178	eng	This umbrella looks like mine.
6260179	eng	I don't know why Tom didn't want Mary to do that.
6260180	eng	Tom was interested in doing that.
6260181	eng	This poem is easy to memorize.
6260182	eng	I didn't want Tom to tell Mary about what we did.
6260183	eng	Tom was in jail for three nights.
6260184	eng	This bridge was built in 2013.
6260185	eng	I didn't tell anyone that I saw Tom kissing Mary.
6260186	eng	Tom was impressed by what he saw.
6260187	eng	They're testing new equipment.
6260188	eng	I didn't tell Tom that I'd seen Mary in the park.
6260189	eng	Tom was hoping to make a fortune.
6260190	eng	They say that they're worried.
6260191	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going out with Mary?
6260192	eng	Tom was going to do that himself.
6260193	eng	They live in different cities.
6260194	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to have a crush on Mary?
6260195	eng	Tom wants to be a French teacher.
6260196	eng	They fought for their country.
6260197	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
6260198	eng	Tom wanted to get back to school.
6260199	eng	They don't eat sausage or ham.
6260200	eng	Did you know that Tom used to be married to Mary?
6260201	eng	Tom wanted to do the right thing.
6260202	eng	These lenses are scratchproof.
6260203	eng	Tom, Mary, John and I are all in the same class.
6260204	eng	Tom wanted to do that very badly.
6260205	eng	There's a calendar over there.
6260206	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he wanted to do that.
6260207	eng	Tom walked through the dense fog.
6260208	eng	The police said I was violent.
6260209	eng	Tom would do that for Mary if she wanted him to.
6260210	eng	Tom used to teach at this school.
6260211	eng	The only organist here is you.
6260212	eng	Tom would be very disappointed if Mary did that.
6260213	eng	Tom used to do that every Monday.
6260214	eng	The only Canadian here is you.
6260215	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to go to college.
6260216	eng	Tom used to do that all the time.
6260217	eng	The meeting is about to begin.
6260218	eng	Tom wondered if Mary really intended to do that.
6260219	eng	Tom used to be my French teacher.
6260220	eng	That's what people usually do.
6260221	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what she needs to do.
6260222	eng	Tom used a towel to dry his hair.
6260223	eng	That's not where I want to go.
6260224	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what he wants to eat.
6260225	eng	Tom tried to jump out of the way.
6260226	eng	That's not where I need to go.
6260227	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what he needs to buy.
6260228	eng	Tom tried really hard to do that.
6260229	eng	That's not where I have to go.
6260230	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what she should buy.
6260231	eng	Tom told us not to do that again.
6260232	eng	That's not what I want to buy.
6260233	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he wants to do.
6260234	eng	Tom told us not to be frightened.
6260235	eng	That's not what I need to buy.
6260236	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he needs to do.
6260237	eng	Tom told me you couldn't do that.
6260238	eng	That's not what I have to buy.
6260239	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what has to be done.
6260240	eng	Tom told me that you'd done that.
6260241	eng	That's a very sensitive issue.
6260242	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he'll never do that.
6260243	eng	Tom told me that he's unemployed.
6260244	eng	That's a movie worth watching.
6260245	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he wants to do that.
6260246	eng	Tom told me that he's suspicious.
6260247	eng	Thanks for helping me do that.
6260248	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he doesn't like her.
6260249	eng	Tom told me that he's interested.
6260250	eng	Shouldn't I be doing that now?
6260251	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told Mary how to do that.
6260252	eng	Tom told me that he's frightened.
6260253	eng	Should I do that now or later?
6260254	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he said he loved her.
6260255	eng	Tom told me that he'd be careful.
6260256	eng	Please tell me who'll do that.
6260257	eng	Tom wants to be gone by the time Mary gets here.
6260258	eng	Tom told me that he was offended.
6260259	eng	Please let me do that for you.
6260260	eng	Tom wanted to tell Mary that she should do that.
6260261	eng	Tom told me that he was confused.
6260262	eng	Please don't do that too much.
6260263	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't think Mary did that.
6260264	eng	Tom told me that I'm incompetent.
6260265	eng	Please don't do that tomorrow.
6260266	eng	Tom told Mary why it was a good idea to do that.
6260267	eng	Tom told me not to do that again.
6260268	eng	Please do that very carefully.
6260269	eng	Tom told Mary why he didn't want her to do that.
6260270	eng	Tom told me he's never done that.
6260271	eng	Please do that somewhere else.
6260272	eng	Tom told Mary that she shouldn't have done that.
6260273	eng	Tom thought his parents had died.
6260274	eng	Perhaps you'd like to do that.
6260275	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be reluctant to do that.
6260276	eng	Tom thought he shouldn't do that.
6260277	eng	Our school has 3,000 students.
6260278	eng	Tom told Mary that he was in Boston last Monday.
6260279	eng	Tom thought he needed to do that.
6260280	eng	No one here tells me anything.
6260281	eng	Tom told Mary that he was going to kill himself.
6260282	eng	Tom thinks you shouldn't do that.
6260283	eng	No decision has been made yet.
6260284	eng	Tom told Mary that he was determined to do that.
6260285	eng	Tom thinks that we can't do that.
6260286	eng	My truck is parked over there.
6260287	eng	Tom told Mary that he was be obliged to do that.
6260288	eng	Tom thinks he's being reasonable.
6260289	eng	My truck got stuck in the mud.
6260290	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought you could do that.
6260291	eng	Tom taught French for many years.
6260292	eng	My room is cleaner than yours.
6260293	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she'd been unfair.
6260294	eng	Tom successfully passed the exam.
6260295	eng	My parents fight all the time.
6260296	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was beautiful.
6260297	eng	Tom studied economics in college.
6260298	eng	My parents argue all the time.
6260299	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't upset.
6260300	eng	Tom still isn't fluent in French.
6260301	eng	My parents are both Canadians.
6260302	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't crazy.
6260303	eng	Tom still hasn't said he's sorry.
6260304	eng	My name was third on the list.
6260305	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't brave.
6260306	eng	Tom still hasn't moved to Boston.
6260307	eng	My name was first on the list.
6260308	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't bossy.
6260309	eng	Tom still goes to work every day.
6260310	eng	My mother is older than yours.
6260311	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was upstairs.
6260312	eng	Tom still does that every summer.
6260313	eng	My house is near where I work.
6260314	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was unbiased.
6260315	eng	Tom still does that every Monday.
6260316	eng	My family is living in Boston.
6260317	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was ticklish.
6260318	eng	Tom still can't use his left arm.
6260319	eng	My expectations were too high.
6260320	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was thrilled.
6260321	eng	Tom stayed longer than he had to.
6260322	eng	My cat doesn't sleep at night.
6260323	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was stubborn.
6260324	vie	Ở Đức mưa có nhiều không?
6260325	eng	Tom stayed here for a short time.
6260326	eng	My approach will be different.
6260327	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was sensible.
6260328	eng	Tom sprained his wrist on Monday.
6260329	eng	My ancestors came from Europe.
6260330	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was prepared.
6260331	eng	Tom sprained his ankle on Monday.
6260332	eng	Maybe we won't finish on time.
6260333	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was outraged.
6260334	eng	Tom spent the whole day swimming.
6260335	eng	Maybe I'll study French today.
6260336	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was mistaken.
6260337	eng	Tom spent a lot of time studying.
6260338	eng	Let's try to do that tomorrow.
6260339	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was innocent.
6260340	eng	Tom spends too much time working.
6260341	eng	Let's play cards after dinner.
6260342	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was impolite.
6260343	eng	Tom speaks French extremely well.
6260344	eng	Let's order a pizza for lunch.
6260345	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was handsome.
6260346	eng	Tom sounds like he's a great guy.
6260347	eng	Let's go to Boston next month.
6260348	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was friendly.
6260349	eng	Tom sounds a lot like his father.
6260350	eng	Let's do that some other time.
6260351	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was creative.
6260352	eng	Tom sold his car three weeks ago.
6260353	eng	Let me tie your shoes for you.
6260354	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was confused.
6260355	eng	Tom snored loudly while he slept.
6260356	eng	It's way too early to do that.
6260357	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was barefoot.
6260358	eng	Tom skimmed through the magazine.
6260359	eng	It's too early to do that now.
6260360	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was annoying.
6260361	eng	Tom sipped the hot coffee slowly.
6260362	eng	It's no use trying to do that.
6260363	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been lonely in Boston.
6260364	eng	Tom shouldn't do that by himself.
6260365	eng	It's getting warmer every day.
6260366	eng	Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was sad.
6260367	eng	Tom shouldn't be allowed in here.
6260368	eng	It's getting colder every day.
6260369	eng	Tom told Mary that John used to be his roommate.
6260370	eng	Tom shouldn't be able to do this.
6260371	eng	It's fun to do that, isn't it?
6260372	eng	Tom told Mary not to leave, but she left anyway.
6260373	eng	Tom should've won, in my opinion.
6260374	eng	It's Monday that I'll do that.
6260375	eng	Tom told Mary it would be OK for her to do that.
6260376	eng	Tom should've refused to do that.
6260377	eng	It'll take forever to do that.
6260378	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't go to Boston with her.
6260379	eng	Tom should've gotten home by now.
6260380	eng	It'll soon be time to do that.
6260381	eng	Tom thought Mary was present at today's meeting.
6260382	eng	Tom should've filled up his tank.
6260383	eng	It'll be expensive to do that.
6260384	eng	Tom thinks that Mary isn't the one who did that.
6260385	eng	Tom should've been on that train.
6260386	eng	It'll be dangerous to do that.
6260387	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be here until after lunch.
6260388	eng	Tom should've been on that plane.
6260389	eng	It would be unsafe to do that.
6260390	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be the next one to do that.
6260391	eng	Tom should really think about it.
6260392	eng	It would be tiring to do that.
6260393	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be the last one to do that.
6260394	eng	Tom should probably do that soon.
6260395	eng	It would be simple to do that.
6260396	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be in her office on Monday.
6260397	eng	Tom should never have to do that.
6260398	eng	It would be better to do that.
6260399	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be here in Boston all week.
6260400	eng	Tom should go to Boston with you.
6260401	eng	It wasn't much fun doing that.
6260402	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be forgiven for doing that.
6260403	eng	Tom should get the death penalty.
6260404	eng	It was really muggy yesterday.
6260405	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't have a driver's license.
6260406	eng	Tom should be willing to do that.
6260407	eng	It snows a lot where I'm from.
6260408	eng	Tom suspected that it was too late to help Mary.
6260409	eng	Tom should be through doing that.
6260410	eng	It snowed every day last week.
6260411	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
6260412	eng	Tom should be the one doing that.
6260413	eng	It should be cheap to do that.
6260414	eng	Tom should've told Mary that she had to do that.
6260415	eng	Tom should be helping us do this.
6260416	eng	It rained every day last week.
6260417	eng	Tom should wait until Mary gets here to do that.
6260418	eng	Tom should be ashamed of himself.
6260419	eng	Isn't it dangerous to do that?
6260420	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary what he has to do.
6260421	eng	Tom should be allowed to do that.
6260422	eng	Is there a zoo near your home?
6260423	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary not to be so nosy.
6260424	eng	Tom shot and killed three tigers.
6260425	eng	Is it OK to speak French here?
6260426	vie	Để tớ nói cho cậu biết nó như thế nào.
6260427	eng	Tom says there's nothing Mary can do about that.
6260428	eng	Tom seldom speaks French anymore.
6260429	eng	Is gold cheaper than platinum?
6260430	eng	Tom says he's already talked to Mary about that.
6260431	eng	Tom seems to know how to do that.
6260432	eng	If you're tired, take a break.
6260433	eng	Tom says he won't do that unless Mary helps him.
6260434	eng	Tom seems to have figured it out.
6260435	eng	I've recently moved to Boston.
6260436	eng	Tom says he thought Mary would enjoy doing that.
6260437	eng	Tom seems to be eager to do that.
6260438	eng	I've just finished doing that.
6260439	eng	Tom says he knows Mary wanted to move to Boston.
6260440	eng	Tom seemed to do a very nice job.
6260441	eng	I've had a lot of girlfriends.
6260442	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't ask him to do that.
6260443	eng	Tom seemed to be very happy here.
6260444	eng	I've enjoyed doing that a lot.
6260445	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who has to do that.
6260446	eng	Tom says they're doing just that.
6260447	eng	I've done that numerous times.
6260448	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows she has to do that.
6260449	eng	Tom says that he does that a lot.
6260450	eng	I've done that enough already.
6260451	eng	Tom says he expects Mary to do that later today.
6260452	eng	Tom says that doesn't bother him.
6260453	eng	I've been told not to do that.
6260454	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to ask Mary to do that.
6260455	eng	Tom says it'll be worth the wait.
6260456	eng	I've been studying since 2:30.
6260457	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
6260458	eng	Tom says his stomach still hurts.
6260459	eng	I've been doing that all week.
6260460	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary ought to do that.
6260461	eng	Tom says his conscience is clear.
6260462	eng	I'm very reluctant to do that.
6260463	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary needs to do that.
6260464	eng	Tom says he's too old to do that.
6260465	eng	I'm troubled by what happened.
6260467	eng	Tom says he's never seen a panda.
6260468	eng	I'm too poor to hire a lawyer.
6260469	eng	Tom says he doesn't really know how old Mary is.
6260470	eng	Tom says he's even eaten insects.
6260471	eng	I'm tired, so I won't do that.
6260472	eng	Tom says he and Mary went to Boston last winter.
6260473	eng	Tom says he's been asked to stay.
6260474	eng	I'm thinking about doing that.
6260475	eng	Tom says he and Mary usually eat lunch together.
6260476	eng	Tom says he'll keep working hard.
6260477	eng	I'm the owner of this company.
6260478	eng	Tom said there's nothing he can do to help Mary.
6260479	eng	Tom says he'll do what he has to.
6260480	eng	I'm the only one who's scared.
6260481	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't playing chess anymore.
6260482	eng	Tom says he'd rather not do that.
6260483	eng	I'm sure that's what happened.
6260484	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be having fun.
6260485	eng	Tom says he wants more than that.
6260486	eng	My savings will soon run out.
6260487	eng	Tom said it wasn't him who told Mary to do that.
6260488	eng	Tom says he used to teach French.
6260490	eng	Tom said he's not sure whether Mary can do that.
6260491	eng	Tom says he used to study French.
6260492	eng	I'm really glad that happened.
6260493	eng	Tom said he'll ask Mary if she wants to do that.
6260494	eng	Tom says he thinks it's possible.
6260495	eng	I'm really enjoying this book.
6260496	eng	Tom said he wasn't expecting Mary to do that.
6260497	eng	Tom says he remembers doing that.
6260498	eng	I'm not sure I should do that.
6260499	eng	Tom said he was going to permit Mary to do that.
6260500	eng	Tom says he often forgets things.
6260501	eng	I'm not capable of doing that.
6260502	eng	Tom said he wanted to see if Mary could do that.
6260503	eng	Tom says he needs more than that.
6260504	eng	I'm not as young as you think.
6260505	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what Mary had to do.
6260506	eng	Tom says he isn't having any fun.
6260507	eng	I'm not able to do that today.
6260508	eng	Tom said he thought Mary could probably do that.
6260509	eng	Tom says he has plans to do that.
6260510	eng	I'm just about to do that now.
6260511	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not want to do that.
6260512	eng	Tom says he has other priorities.
6260513	eng	I'm going to do that tomorrow.
6260514	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not need to do that.
6260515	eng	Tom says he doesn't study French.
6260516	eng	I'm busy doing that right now.
6260517	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that.
6260518	eng	Tom says he doesn't speak French.
6260519	eng	I'm aware of what's happening.
6260520	eng	Tom said he isn't going to John and Mary's wedding.
6260521	eng	Tom says he didn't know about it.
6260522	eng	I'm able to understand French.
6260523	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't do that anymore.
6260524	eng	Tom says he didn't have a lawyer.
6260525	eng	I'll work in Boston next year.
6260526	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would do that right away.
6260527	eng	Tom says he did it for the money.
6260528	eng	I'll do that while it's quiet.
6260529	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to help us.
6260530	eng	Tom said aliens had abducted him.
6260531	eng	I'll do that when I have time.
6260532	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to do that.
6260533	eng	Tom says I ought to study French.
6260534	eng	I'll do that if you pay me to.
6260535	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
6260536	eng	Tom says I don't need to do that.
6260537	eng	I'll do that even if it rains.
6260538	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary ought to do that.
6260539	eng	Tom says I don't have to do that.
6260540	eng	I'll be here for three months.
6260541	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary needs to do that.
6260542	eng	Tom saw me when I was doing that.
6260543	eng	I'll arrange to get that done.
6260544	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary wants to go.
6260545	eng	Tom sat down and lit a cigarette.
6260546	eng	I'd stay in Boston if I could.
6260547	eng	Tom said he doesn't know any of Mary's children.
6260548	eng	Tom sat at the head of the table.
6260549	eng	I'd recommend studying French.
6260550	eng	Tom said he didn't want to do that without Mary.
6260551	eng	Tom said what he intended to say.
6260552	eng	I'd rather you didn't do that.
6260553	eng	Tom said he didn't understand why Mary did that.
6260554	eng	Tom said whales are worth saving.
6260555	eng	I'd never consider doing that.
6260556	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary wanted to do that.
6260557	eng	Tom said the truck wasn't locked.
6260558	eng	I'd like to go there with you.
6260559	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to do that.
6260560	eng	Tom said the event was a success.
6260561	eng	I'd like one of those scarves.
6260562	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary knew how to drive.
6260563	eng	Tom said that would never happen.
6260564	eng	I'd come to Boston if I could.
6260565	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary had to do that.
6260566	eng	Tom said that would happen soon.
6260567	eng	I'd be tempted to do that now.
6260568	eng	Tom said Mary's parents seemed like nice people.
6260569	eng	Tom said that wasn't a good idea.
6260570	eng	I work as an ambulance driver.
6260571	eng	Tom said Mary would likely be afraid to do that.
6260572	eng	Tom said that he was ready to go.
6260573	eng	I wonder if I need to do that.
6260574	eng	Tom said Mary would be going to Boston with him.
6260575	eng	Tom said that he really liked me.
6260576	eng	I won't study French tomorrow.
6260577	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't willing to do that anymore.
6260578	eng	Tom said that he likes good wine.
6260579	eng	I won't permit you to do that.
6260580	eng	Tom said Mary was troubled by what had happened.
6260581	eng	Tom said that he doesn't do that.
6260582	eng	I won't have to do that alone.
6260583	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help you do that.
6260584	eng	Tom said that he broke the glass.
6260585	eng	I won't have to do that again.
6260586	eng	Tom said Mary was too drunk to help you do that.
6260587	eng	Tom said that could never happen.
6260588	eng	I won't go to Boston with you.
6260589	eng	Tom said Mary was too busy to help John do that.
6260590	eng	Tom said that I had to study French.
6260591	eng	I won't be doing that anymore.
6260592	eng	Tom said Mary was the one who wanted to do that.
6260593	eng	Tom said it was him who did that.
6260594	eng	I won't be allowed to do that.
6260595	eng	Tom said Mary was the one who needed to do that.
6260596	eng	Tom said it could cause problems.
6260597	eng	I wish you would speak French.
6260598	eng	Tom said Mary was reluctant to do that for John.
6260599	eng	Tom said his stomach still hurts.
6260600	eng	I wish I hadn't spoken French.
6260601	eng	Tom said Mary was living in Boston at that time.
6260602	eng	Tom said his house wasn't locked.
6260603	eng	I wish I hadn't eaten so much.
6260604	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be unemployed.
6260605	eng	Tom said his conscience is clear.
6260606	eng	I wish I hadn't drunk so much.
6260607	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be suspicious.
6260608	eng	Tom said he's willing to do that.
6260609	eng	I wish I could do this better.
6260610	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be interested.
6260611	eng	Tom said he's through doing that.
6260612	eng	I wish I could do that better.
6260613	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be handcuffed.
6260614	eng	Tom said he's tempted to do that.
6260615	eng	I wasn't sure I could do that.
6260616	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be frightened.
6260617	eng	Tom said he's ready for the test.
6260618	eng	I wasn't permitted to do that.
6260619	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be downstairs.
6260620	eng	Tom said he's only tried it once.
6260621	eng	I wasn't in Boston last month.
6260622	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be doing that.
6260623	eng	Tom said he's fascinated by that.
6260624	eng	I wasn't able to study French.
6260625	eng	Tom said Mary wanted John to do that by himself.
6260626	eng	Tom said he's been robbed before.
6260627	eng	I was told to stay in my room.
6260628	eng	Tom said Mary told him she was ready to do that.
6260629	eng	Tom said he's been feeling tired.
6260630	eng	I was the last one to do that.
6260631	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might need to do that.
6260632	eng	Tom said he'd rather not go home.
6260633	eng	I was in Boston two weeks ago.
6260634	eng	Tom said Mary thought she might have to do that.
6260635	eng	Tom said he'd pay for the dinner.
6260636	eng	I was impressed by what I saw.
6260637	eng	Tom said Mary should've stayed in Boston longer.
6260638	eng	Tom said he'd never teach French.
6260639	eng	I was going to do that myself.
6260640	eng	Tom said Mary probably wouldn't want to do that.
6260641	eng	Tom said he'd never study French.
6260642	eng	I was being forced to do that.
6260643	eng	Tom said Mary needed to do that before she left.
6260644	eng	Tom said he'd likely not do that.
6260645	eng	I was allowed to speak French.
6260646	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that.
6260647	eng	Tom said he'd do that and he did.
6260648	eng	I was advised to study French.
6260649	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not need to do that.
6260650	eng	Tom said he'd definitely do that.
6260651	eng	I wanted to study French, too.
6260652	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might not have to do that.
6260653	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to help us.
6260654	eng	I wanted to go to the library.
6260655	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still studying French.
6260657	eng	I wanted to go back to school.
6260658	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at speaking French.
6260659	eng	Tom said he'd be doing that soon.
6260660	eng	I wanted to go back to Boston.
6260661	eng	Tom said Mary is going to go see John in Boston.
6260662	eng	Tom said he'd be back in October.
6260663	eng	I wanted to do that yesterday.
6260664	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen him wearing a suit.
6260665	eng	Tom said he'd be able to do that.
6260666	eng	I wanted to do that by myself.
6260667	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John wearing a hat.
6260668	eng	Tom said he would do that for me.
6260669	eng	I want you to teach me French.
6260670	eng	Tom said Mary has been trying to be cooperative.
6260671	eng	Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
6260672	eng	I want to see you immediately.
6260673	eng	Tom said Mary has been told not do that anymore.
6260674	eng	Tom said he was worried about me.
6260675	eng	I want to play chess with you.
6260676	eng	Tom said Mary has always been interested in art.
6260677	eng	Tom said he was unlikely do that.
6260678	eng	I want to move back to Boston.
6260679	eng	Tom said Mary had a really hard time doing that.
6260680	eng	Tom said he was told not do that.
6260681	eng	I want to go hunting with you.
6260682	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to do that by herself.
6260683	eng	Tom said he was ready to do that.
6260684	eng	I want to get a part-time job.
6260685	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John really did that.
6260686	eng	Tom said he was happy to do that.
6260687	eng	I want to do that immediately.
6260688	eng	Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary what we did that.
6260689	eng	Tom said he was enjoying himself.
6260690	eng	I want to do better next time.
6260691	eng	Tom reminded Mary that she had to do that today.
6260692	eng	Tom said he was asked to do that.
6260693	eng	I want to continue doing that.
6260694	eng	Tom promised Mary that he'd never do that again.
6260695	eng	Tom said he wants to change that.
6260696	eng	I told you to quit doing that.
6260697	eng	Tom probably doesn't yet know why Mary did that.
6260698	eng	Tom said he wants to buy a yacht.
6260699	eng	I thought you weren't married.
6260700	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary was arrested.
6260701	eng	Tom said he wants to be a lawyer.
6260702	eng	I thought you used to do that.
6260703	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is Canadian.
6260704	eng	Tom said he thought I looked sad.
6260705	eng	I thought I'd like to do that.
6260706	eng	Tom probably couldn't talk Mary into doing that.
6260707	eng	Tom said he thought I looked fit.
6260708	eng	I thought I needed to do that.
6260709	eng	Tom pretended not to notice what Mary was doing.
6260710	eng	Tom said he saw a UFO last night.
6260711	eng	I think it might rain tonight.
6260712	eng	Tom must've thought Mary had a driver's license.
6260713	eng	Tom said he plans to be a doctor.
6260714	eng	I think I've done that before.
6260715	eng	Tom must've thought Mary didn't want to do that.
6260716	eng	Tom said he paid $300 in advance.
6260717	eng	I think I'll do that tomorrow.
6260718	eng	Tom must've thought Mary didn't need to do that.
6260719	eng	Tom said he likes to help others.
6260720	eng	I think I should visit Boston.
6260721	eng	Tom must've thought Mary didn't have to do that.
6260722	eng	Tom said he isn't having any fun.
6260723	eng	I think I should study French.
6260724	eng	Tom must've been faster at doing that than Mary.
6260725	eng	Tom said he hopes to change that.
6260726	eng	I think I should go to Boston.
6260727	eng	Tom looked around the room, but didn't see Mary.
6260728	eng	Tom said he heard a lot of shots.
6260729	eng	I think I may want to do that.
6260730	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said he didn't do that.
6260731	eng	Tom said he felt like doing that.
6260732	eng	I think Boston is a safe city.
6260733	eng	Tom let Mary know he didn't know how to do that.
6260734	eng	Tom said he felt good about that.
6260735	eng	I swear I won't do that again.
6260736	eng	Tom knows that Mary wasn't the one who did that.
6260737	eng	Tom said he doesn't hunt anymore.
6260738	eng	I suspected this would happen.
6260739	eng	Tom knows that Mary doesn't know how to do that.
6260740	eng	Tom said he didn't want to dance.
6260741	eng	I study French whenever I can.
6260742	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary in front of the station.
6260743	eng	Tom said he didn't smoke anymore.
6260744	eng	I still haven't done that yet.
6260745	eng	Tom is trying to convince Mary to do that today.
6260746	eng	Tom said he didn't have a lawyer.
6260747	eng	I still have a lot of bananas.
6260748	eng	Tom is the only one who ever really helped Mary.
6260749	eng	Tom said he did that three times.
6260750	eng	I sometimes do that by myself.
6260751	eng	Tom is good at singing, but not as good as Mary.
6260752	eng	Tom said he appreciated the help.
6260753	eng	I shouldn't do that by myself.
6260754	eng	Tom informed Mary that she had to do that today.
6260755	eng	Tom said doing that would be fun.
6260756	eng	I shouldn't be doing this now.
6260757	eng	Tom has told Mary that he's required to do that.
6260758	eng	Tom said I should've walked away.
6260759	eng	I should've done that earlier.
6260760	eng	Tom has told Mary she looks a little overweight.
6260761	eng	Tom said I ought to study French.
6260762	eng	I should've called the police.
6260763	eng	Tom has to be glad that Mary is coming to visit.
6260764	eng	Tom said I made the wrong choice.
6260765	eng	I should've brought more food.
6260766	eng	Tom has enough money to buy whatever Mary wants.
6260767	eng	Tom said I don't need to do that.
6260768	eng	I should've been more patient.
6260769	eng	Tom has been trying to convince Mary to do that.
6260770	eng	Tom said I don't have to do that.
6260771	eng	I should probably not do that.
6260772	eng	Tom has apologized to Mary for having done that.
6260773	eng	Tom returned to Boston on Monday.
6260774	eng	I should probably go home now.
6260775	eng	Tom has already told Mary what she needs to buy.
6260776	eng	Tom refused to sign the petition.
6260777	eng	I should go ahead and do that.
6260778	eng	Tom has already told Mary what needs to be done.
6260779	eng	Tom really wants to study French.
6260780	eng	I should be there pretty soon.
6260781	eng	Tom had no idea that Mary was going to kiss him.
6260782	eng	Tom really wants to keep his job.
6260783	eng	I should be in Boston by 2:30.
6260784	eng	Tom finally managed to persuade Mary to do that.
6260785	eng	Tom really should've done better.
6260786	eng	I should be getting paid more.
6260787	eng	Tom figured if Mary could do that, he could too.
6260788	eng	Tom really should think about it.
6260789	eng	I should be back here by 2:30.
6260790	eng	Tom explained to Mary why she shouldn't do that.
6260791	eng	Tom really looks a lot like John.
6260792	eng	I shot and killed both wolves.
6260793	eng	Tom doesn't think it's safe for Mary to do that.
6260794	eng	Tom really likes traveling a lot.
6260795	eng	I seldom speak French anymore.
6260796	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would do that on purpose.
6260797	eng	Tom really likes science fiction.
6260798	eng	I seldom go to Boston anymore.
6260799	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be able to do that.
6260800	eng	Tom really likes chocolate a lot.
6260801	eng	I see no need to study French.
6260802	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be doing that today.
6260803	eng	Tom really doesn't have a choice.
6260804	eng	I see no need to go to Boston.
6260805	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be doing that again.
6260807	eng	We sat together at the counter.
6260808	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will allow me to do that.
6260809	eng	Tom reads at a third grade level.
6260810	eng	I said I was going to do that.
6260811	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is capable of doing that.
6260812	eng	Tom read a story to his children.
6260813	eng	I remember giving you the key.
6260814	eng	Tom doesn't remember Mary asking him to do that.
6260815	eng	Tom rarely speaks French anymore.
6260816	eng	I really want to study French.
6260817	eng	Tom doesn't really think Mary did that, does he?
6260818	eng	Tom rarely does things like that.
6260819	eng	I really want to go to Boston.
6260820	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary would want to do that.
6260821	eng	Tom quit smoking three years ago.
6260822	eng	I probably won't study French.
6260823	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary dropped out of school.
6260824	eng	Tom put some butter on his toast.
6260825	eng	I plan to swim while I'm here.
6260826	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary likes dogs or not.
6260827	eng	Tom promised to do that tomorrow.
6260828	eng	I plan to come to Boston soon.
6260829	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is thirsty or not.
6260830	eng	Tom promised not to go out alone.
6260831	eng	I never wanted to get married.
6260832	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary bought her computer.
6260833	eng	Tom probably won't pass the test.
6260834	eng	I never wanted this to happen.
6260835	eng	Tom doesn't know what Mary would like him to do.
6260836	eng	Tom probably won't pass the exam.
6260837	eng	I never wanted that to happen.
6260838	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary knows how to do that.
6260839	eng	Tom probably won't get the prize.
6260840	eng	I needed to do that yesterday.
6260841	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary can do that by herself.
6260842	eng	Tom probably won't do that today.
6260843	eng	I needed to do that by myself.
6260844	eng	Tom didn't want to know why Mary didn't do that.
6260845	eng	Tom probably won't do that again.
6260846	eng	I need to remember to do that.
6260847	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be ready to do that.
6260848	eng	Tom probably isn't in his office.
6260849	eng	I need to make some decisions.
6260850	eng	Tom didn't think Mary looked nervous doing that.
6260851	eng	Tom probably isn't in Boston now.
6260852	eng	I need to buy some blue paint.
6260853	eng	Tom didn't seem to understand why Mary did that.
6260854	eng	Tom played soccer and basketball.
6260855	eng	I need to buy another bicycle.
6260856	eng	Tom didn't notice that Mary had a new hairstyle.
6260857	eng	Tom plans to retire when he's 65.
6260858	eng	I might not go shopping today.
6260859	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary didn't want to do that.
6260860	eng	Tom plans to do better next time.
6260861	eng	I may go to Boston next month.
6260862	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary didn't need to do that.
6260863	eng	Tom plans to continue doing that.
6260864	eng	I made the same mistake again.
6260865	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary didn't have to do that.
6260866	eng	Tom plans to come back to Boston.
6260867	eng	I looked in my bag for my pen.
6260868	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was thirsty or not.
6260869	eng	Tom picked me up on his way home.
6260870	eng	I left my umbrella in the hall.
6260871	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary could drive or not.
6260872	eng	Tom owns many valuable paintings.
6260874	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary had bought her watch.
6260875	eng	Tom overslept and missed his bus.
6260876	eng	I know you aren't really busy.
6260877	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was thinking of doing.
6260878	eng	Tom outlived many of his friends.
6260879	eng	I know why you went to Boston.
6260880	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was making for dinner.
6260881	eng	Tom often eats fruit for dessert.
6260882	eng	I know why you had to do that.
6260883	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary would be at the party.
6260884	eng	Tom often doesn't come to school.
6260885	eng	I know why you didn't do that.
6260886	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was going to kiss him.

6260888	eng	I know why I ought to do that.
6260889	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's girlfriend.
6260890	eng	Tom never wants to do that again.
6260891	eng	I know where you hide your key.
6260892	eng	Tom didn't know how much more money Mary wanted.
6260893	eng	Tom never wanted to teach French.
6260894	eng	I know what's really going on.
6260895	eng	Tom didn't know how much Mary wanted to do that.
6260896	eng	Tom never studies French anymore.
6260897	eng	I know what time you got home.
6260898	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wasn't supposed to do that.
6260899	eng	Tom never seems to feel the heat.
6260900	eng	I know three girls named Mary.
6260901	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was going to do that today.
6260902	eng	Tom never seems to feel the cold.
6260903	eng	I know that's not worth doing.
6260904	eng	Tom decided not to speak French to Mary anymore.
6260905	eng	Tom never made it onto the plane.
6260906	eng	I know that I want to do that.
6260907	eng	Tom decided Mary was the one who should do that.
6260908	eng	Tom never forgot to pay his rent.
6260909	eng	I know that I need to do that.
6260910	eng	Tom could do that for Mary if she wanted him to.
6260911	eng	Tom never forgets to do anything.
6260912	eng	I know that I have to do that.
6260913	eng	Tom assured Mary that he wouldn't do that again.
6260914	eng	Tom never felt sorry for himself.
6260915	eng	I know not to do that anymore.
6260916	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had never studied French.
6260917	eng	Tom never expected to walk again.
6260918	eng	I know how to play the violin.
6260919	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had left the party early.
6260920	eng	Tom needs to lower his standards.
6260921	eng	I know how to play the guitar.
6260922	eng	Tom asked Mary to stop complaining all the time.
6260923	eng	Tom needs to consider doing that.
6260924	eng	I know I'm in big trouble now.
6260925	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really enjoyed doing that.
6260926	eng	Tom needs crutches to get around.
6260927	eng	I know I have to keep working.
6260928	eng	Tom asked Mary if she had to do that by herself.
6260929	eng	Tom must've thought nobody cared.
6260930	eng	I knew I'd be able to do that.
6260931	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to go to the dance together.
6260932	eng	Tom must've done that by himself.
6260933	eng	I just do what I'm told to do.
6260934	eng	Tom and Mary talked to each other all afternoon.
6260935	eng	Tom must've been scared to death.
6260936	eng	I hope you can do that for us.
6260937	eng	Tom and Mary still talk to each other every day.
6260938	eng	Tom must be desperate to do that.
6260939	eng	I hope you can do that for me.
6260940	eng	Tom and Mary have never been on a date together.
6260941	eng	Tom mostly talked about his trip.
6260942	eng	I hope tomorrow isn't too hot.
6260943	eng	Tom and Mary almost never argue with each other.
6260944	eng	Tom moonlighted as a taxi driver.
6260945	eng	I hope to become an architect.
6260946	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know what Mary is looking for.
6260947	eng	Tom misses his mother and father.
6260948	eng	I hope to be a barber someday.
6260949	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
6260950	eng	Tom might be studying French now.
6260951	eng	I hope that you don't do that.
6260952	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that.
6260953	eng	Tom may want to do that with you.
6260954	eng	I hope it won't snow tomorrow.
6260955	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary didn't do that.
6260956	eng	Tom may speak French if he wants.
6260957	eng	I hope it won't rain tomorrow.
6260958	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't be happy if Mary did that.
6260959	eng	Tom may speak French if he likes.
6260960	eng	I helped the kids get dressed.
6260961	eng	I wonder if Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that.
6260962	eng	Tom may not go to Boston with us.
6260963	eng	I haven't watered the flowers.
6260964	eng	I know Tom and Mary are in love with each other.
6260965	eng	Tom may have everything he wants.
6260966	eng	I haven't finished the report.
6260967	eng	I don't want Tom to tell Mary about what we did.
6260968	eng	Tom may go to Boston next summer.
6260969	eng	I haven't ever studied French.
6260970	eng	I don't think Tom can stop Mary from doing that.
6260971	eng	Tom may do that however he likes.

6261416	eng	I did that from 12:00 to 2:30.
6261417	eng	Tom said Mary was asked not to do that anymore.
6261418	eng	Tom is already halfway to Boston.

6261467	eng	I actually did that yesterday.
6261468	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John did that alone.
6261469	eng	Tom is a good guy to have around.
6261470	eng	I actually did that by myself.
6261471	eng	Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary why we did that.

6261488	eng	How long do I have to do that?
6261489	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is unhappy.

6261491	eng	How about doing that tomorrow?
6261492	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how Mary got injured.
6261493	eng	Tom hung the lamp on a tree limb.

6261496	eng	Tom hopes to return to Australia.
6261497	eng	How I can lose weight quickly?
6261498	eng	Tom probably can't do that as well as Mary can.
6261499	eng	Tom hired a private investigator.
6261500	eng	Have you taught French before?
6261501	eng	Tom must've thought Mary couldn't speak French.
6261502	eng	Tom hid in an abandoned building.
6261503	eng	Have you found a solution yet?
6261504	eng	Tom may be able to talk Mary out of doing that.

6261515	eng	Giving up is always an option.
6261516	eng	Tom isn't very likely to know where Mary lives.
6261517	eng	Tom hasn't even tried to do that.

6261533	eng	Don't ask me stupid questions.
6261534	eng	Tom has asked Mary to drive him to the airport.
6261536	eng	Doing that's really very easy.

6261543	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he needs to buy.
6261544	eng	Tom has told me I should do that.
6261545	eng	Doing that would be too risky.
6261546	eng	Tom had no idea when Mary was going to do that.
6261547	eng	Tom has to do that every morning.

6261555	eng	Tom had a crush on Mary when he was a teenager.
6261556	eng	Tom has the evidence to prove it.
6261557	eng	Doing that should be possible.
6261558	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she said she wanted.
6261559	eng	Tom has strong religious beliefs.
6261560	eng	Doing that seems stupid to me.
6261561	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she said she needed.
6261562	eng	Tom has started doing that again.
6261563	eng	Doing that isn't allowed here.

6261565	eng	Tom has since returned to school.

6261567	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would forget to do that.
6261568	eng	Tom has said he wants to do that.
6261569	eng	Do you think we could do that?

6261583	eng	Tom has no choice but to do that.
6261584	eng	Do you intend to do that here?
6261585	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is reluctant to do that.

6261588	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is permitted to do that.
6261589	eng	Tom has never lived in Australia.

6261605	eng	Did you receive an invitation?

6261608	eng	Did you come to Boston by bus?

6261698	eng	You're mad at us, aren't you?
6261699	eng	Tom asked Mary why she needed to do that again.
6261700	eng	Tom has always been a hockey fan.
6261701	eng	You're a very strange person.
6261702	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really wanted to do that.
6261703	eng	Tom has all day to get that done.
6261704	eng	You're a very selfish person.
6261705	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really needed to do that.
6261706	eng	Tom has agreed to be interviewed.
6261707	eng	You're a very patient person.
6261708	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew what John was going.
6261709	eng	Tom has a scar on his left cheek.
6261710	eng	You're a very beautiful girl.
6261711	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to go on a picnic together.
6261712	eng	Tom has a lot to be grateful for.
6261713	eng	You're a runaway, aren't you?
6261714	eng	Tom and Mary aren't very likely to wait for us.
6261715	eng	Tom has a hat just like that one.
6261716	eng	You're a really good manager.
6261717	eng	Tom and I are waiting for Mary, John and Alice.
6261718	eng	Tom has a great deal of property.
6261719	eng	You're a pretty good swimmer.
6261720	eng	The last time Tom saw Mary was three years ago.
6261721	eng	Tom has a cabin in the mountains.
6261722	eng	You're a pitcher, aren't you?
6261723	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is very likely to do that.
6261724	eng	Tom has a background in business.
6261725	eng	You're a pianist, aren't you?
6261726	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why Mary has to do that.
6261727	eng	Tom had to leave his dog at home.
6261728	eng	You're a lot older than I am.
6261729	eng	It's necessary for Tom to talk to Mary himself.
6261730	eng	Tom had the decency to apologize.
6261731	eng	You're a good French speaker.
6261732	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
6261733	eng	Tom had surgery on his right leg.
6261734	eng	You're a gambler, aren't you?
6261735	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary has to do that.
6261736	eng	Tom had no complaints about that.
6261737	eng	You're a fairly good drummer.
6261738	eng	I thought Tom was going to ask Mary to do that.
6261739	eng	Tom had no choice but to do that.
6261740	eng	You're a charmer, aren't you?
6261741	eng	I think Tom will be able to help Mary tomorrow.
6261742	eng	Tom had never been kissed before.
6261743	eng	You're a butcher, aren't you?
6261744	eng	I think Tom is sure that's what Mary has to do.
6261745	eng	Tom had his car stolen last week.
6261746	eng	You'll never have to do that.
6261747	eng	I think Tom could convince Mary not to do that.
6261748	eng	Tom had all day to get that done.
6261749	eng	You'll need to do that again.
6261750	eng	I pretty much told Tom the same thing Mary did.
6261751	eng	Tom had a very successful career.
6261752	eng	You'd better not do that now.
6261753	eng	I don't think Tom would permit Mary to do that.
6261755	eng	You'd better do that at once.
6261756	eng	I don't think Tom will be doing that with Mary.
6261757	eng	Tom graduated first in his class.
6261758	eng	You won't be able to do that.
6261759	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's ex-boyfriend.
6261760	eng	Tom got to the hotel around 2:30.
6261761	eng	You still owe me some change.
6261762	eng	I asked Tom the same question I'd asked Mary.
6261763	eng	Tom got suspended for doing that.
6261764	eng	You still do that, don't you?
6261765	eng	How often does Tom help Mary with her homework?
6261766	eng	Tom got some water from the well.
6261767	eng	You shouldn't think about it.
6261768	eng	Even if Tom doesn't do that, I think Mary will.
6261769	eng	Tom got out of his truck and ran.
6261770	eng	You should stay here with us.
6261771	eng	Didn't you know Tom used to be married to Mary?
6261772	eng	Tom got dressed and went outside.
6261773	eng	You should do that elsewhere.
6261774	eng	Did you know Tom was living with Mary's family?
6261775	eng	Tom glanced through the magazine.
6261776	eng	You seem to enjoy doing that.
6261777	eng	Did you know Tom and John were Mary's brothers?
6261778	eng	Tom gets paid to play basketball.
6261779	eng	You seem hesitant to do that.
6261780	eng	Did you know Mary and Alice were Tom's sisters?
6261781	eng	Tom gave me a painting as a gift.
6261782	eng	You said I shouldn't do that.
6261783	eng	You'll ask Tom to do that for Mary, won't you?
6261784	eng	Tom gave me a nice pair of boots.
6261785	eng	You said I ought not do that.
6261786	eng	You knew Tom told Mary to do that, didn't you?
6261787	eng	Tom found it hard to be unbiased.
6261788	eng	You said I needed to do that.
6261789	eng	You asked Tom to do that for Mary, didn't you?
6261790	eng	Tom forced his way into the room.
6261792	eng	Why don't you get Tom to tell Mary to do that?
6261793	eng	Tom fixed the car all by himself.
6261794	eng	You ought to stop doing that.
6261795	eng	When was it that Tom went to Boston with Mary?
6261796	eng	Tom finds doing that interesting.
6261797	eng	You need to start doing that.
6261798	eng	Tom would make Mary very happy if he did that.
6261799	eng	Tom filed for divorce in October.
6261800	eng	You need to listen carefully.
6261801	eng	Tom wondered who Mary had gone to Boston with.
6261802	eng	Tom filed for bankruptcy in 2013.
6261803	eng	You need to do that tomorrow.
6261804	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary which dress to buy.
6261805	eng	Tom felt he didn't have a choice.
6261806	eng	You need to be more tolerant.
6261807	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what she has to do.
6261808	eng	Tom fell asleep during the movie.
6261809	eng	You need a permit to do that.
6261810	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what he has to buy.
6261811	eng	Tom failed to get the nomination.
6261812	eng	You must not do that anymore.
6261813	eng	Tom won't be able to convince Mary to do that.
6261814	eng	Tom failed the breathalyzer test.
6261815	eng	You may need to study French.
6261816	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary which book to buy.
6261817	eng	Tom explained the situation well.
6261818	eng	You look quite uncomfortable.
6261819	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary what he has to do.
6261820	eng	Tom explained his position to me.
6261821	eng	You look quite sophisticated.
6261822	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to be so nosy.
6261823	eng	Tom enlisted in the Army in 2013.
6261824	eng	You look like a friendly guy.
6261825	eng	Tom went on a picnic with Mary and her family.
6261826	eng	Tom earned his doctorate in 2013.
6261827	eng	You look kind of embarrassed.
6261828	eng	Tom wasn't the one who wanted Mary to do that.
6261829	eng	Tom dropped the cup and it broke.
6261830	eng	You like red wine, don't you?
6261831	eng	Tom wasn't convinced that Mary had to do that.
6261832	eng	Tom drank about as much as I did.
6261833	eng	You just drank from my glass.
6261834	eng	Tom was the one who showed Mary around Boston.
6261835	eng	Tom drank a whole bottle of wine.
6261836	eng	You have to start doing that.
6261837	eng	Tom was convinced that Mary wanted to do that.
6261838	eng	Tom doesn't want to teach French.
6261839	eng	You have to do that tomorrow.
6261840	eng	Tom was convinced that Mary needed to do that.
6261841	eng	Tom doesn't want to stay at home.
6261842	eng	You felt nervous, didn't you?
6261843	eng	Tom told Mary why he enjoyed dancing with her.
6261844	eng	Tom doesn't want to speak French.
6261845	eng	You encouraged us to do that.
6261846	eng	Tom told Mary to do that as soon as she could.
6261847	eng	Tom doesn't want to lose his job.
6261848	eng	You drive to work, don't you?
6261849	eng	Tom told Mary that she should try to be early.
6261850	eng	Tom doesn't want to go to church.
6261851	eng	You do that faster than I do.
6261852	eng	Tom told Mary that she should stop doing that.
6261853	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that here.
6261854	eng	You do that better than I do.
6261855	eng	Tom told Mary that she should quit doing that.
6261856	eng	Tom doesn't want to be suspended.
6261857	eng	You do that a lot, don't you?
6261858	eng	Tom told Mary that she didn't have to do that.
6261859	eng	Tom doesn't think you'll do that.
6261860	eng	You did that wrong last time.
6261861	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be willing to do that.
6261862	eng	Tom doesn't think we can do that.
6261863	eng	You did that right this time.
6261864	eng	Tom told Mary that he was prepared to do that.
6261865	eng	Tom doesn't think he can do that.
6261866	eng	You can't take pictures here.
6261867	eng	Tom told Mary that he was hesitant to do that.
6261868	eng	Tom doesn't teach French anymore.
6261869	eng	You can leave if you want to.
6261870	eng	Tom told Mary that he was finished doing that.
6261871	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be concerned.
6261872	eng	Would you mind if I did that?
6261873	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she'd been fair.
6261874	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be breathing.
6261875	eng	Would you all please go home?
6261876	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was stoned.
6261877	eng	Tom doesn't recommend doing that.
6261878	eng	Would it be OK if I did that?
6261879	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was sleepy.
6261880	eng	Tom doesn't really have a choice.
6261881	eng	Will you be doing that again?
6261882	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was scared.
6261883	eng	Tom doesn't plan to study French.
6261884	eng	Will it be ready on the 20th?
6261885	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was lonely.
6261886	eng	Tom doesn't often come to school.
6261887	eng	Why would we have to do that?
6261888	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was insane.
6261889	eng	Tom doesn't need to study French.
6261890	eng	Why would I buy that for you?
6261891	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was hungry.
6261892	eng	Tom doesn't look very busy to me.
6261893	eng	Why don't you to relax a bit?
6261894	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was honest.
6261895	eng	Tom doesn't look too upset to me.
6261896	eng	Why do you need two bicycles?
6261897	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was boring.
6261898	eng	Tom doesn't look too happy to me.
6261899	eng	Why aren't you in Boston now?
6261900	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was biased.
6261901	eng	Tom doesn't look too angry to me.
6261902	eng	Why are you coming to Boston?
6261903	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was asleep.
6261904	eng	Tom doesn't look like he's tired.
6261905	eng	Whose car is that over there?
6261906	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was afraid.
6261907	eng	Tom doesn't look like a beginner.
6261908	eng	Who'll go to Boston with you?
6261909	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was absent.
6261910	eng	Tom doesn't like to study French.
6261911	eng	Who'll be in Boston with you?
6261912	eng	Tom told Mary that he had tried to be careful.
6261913	eng	Tom doesn't like teaching French.
6261914	eng	Who told you I could do that?
6261915	eng	Tom told Mary and John that they should leave.
6261916	eng	Tom doesn't like studying French.
6261917	eng	Who brought the marshmallows?
6261918	eng	Tom told Mary about the job he'd been offered.
6261919	eng	Tom doesn't like being surprised.
6261920	eng	Who braids your hair for you?
6261921	eng	Tom thought that it was too late to help Mary.
6261922	eng	Tom doesn't know that I'm hungry.
6261923	eng	Which way is the post office?
6261924	eng	Tom thought he would be able to cheer Mary up.
6261925	eng	Tom doesn't know that I hate him.
6261926	eng	Which parking space is yours?
6261927	eng	Tom thought Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6261928	eng	Tom doesn't have to go to school.
6261929	eng	Which pair of shoes is yours?
6261930	eng	Tom thought Mary was the first one to do that.
6261931	eng	Tom doesn't have time to do that.
6261932	eng	Where's the manager's office?
6261933	eng	Tom thought Mary was interested in doing that.
6261934	eng	Tom doesn't have much experience.
6261935	eng	Where will you be in October?
6261936	eng	Tom thought Mary was in her office on Mondays.
6261937	eng	Tom doesn't feel like doing that.
6261938	eng	Where in Boston did you live?
6261939	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be upset if he did that.
6261940	eng	Tom doesn't ever do that anymore.
6261941	eng	Where do you usually do that?
6261942	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6261943	eng	Tom doesn't even want it anymore.
6261944	eng	Where did you stay in Boston?
6261945	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be motivated to do that.
6261946	eng	Tom doesn't care how you do that.
6261947	eng	Where did you go last summer?
6261948	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be reluctant to do that.
6261949	eng	Tom doesn't believe you did that.
6261950	eng	When will you come to Boston?
6261951	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be motivated to do that.
6261952	eng	Tom doesn't believe I'll do that.
6261953	eng	When are you going to finish?
6261954	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be here until lunchtime.
6261955	eng	Tom doesn't beat around the bush.
6261956	eng	What you're doing isn't safe.
6261957	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that by herself.
6261958	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be unhappy.
6261959	eng	What prompted you to do that?
6261960	eng	Tom still hasn't forgiven Mary for doing that.
6261961	eng	Tom does that three times a week.
6261963	eng	Tom should've told Mary not to stay in Boston.
6261964	eng	Tom does that as often as he can.
6261965	eng	What did you say to the boss?
6261966	eng	Tom should've told Mary not to come to Boston.
6261967	eng	Tom does nothing but read comics.
6261968	eng	What did that suggest to you?
6261969	eng	Tom should've asked Mary if she could do that.
6261970	eng	Tom does everything very quickly.
6261971	eng	Were you wearing a seat belt?
6261972	eng	Tom should tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6261973	eng	Tom does as well as you'd expect.
6261974	eng	Were you in Boston yesterday?
6261975	eng	Tom should tell Mary he won't be at her party.
6261976	eng	Tom died while on a hunting trip.
6261977	eng	Were you in Boston on Monday?

6261979	eng	Tom died soon after the accident.
6261980	eng	Were you in Boston last year?
6261981	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he's sleepy.
6261982	eng	Tom died peacefully in his sleep.
6261983	eng	Were you in Boston last week?
6261984	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he's hungry.
6261985	eng	Tom died of tuberculosis in 2013.
6261986	eng	We've decided not to do that.
6261987	eng	Tom should be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6261988	eng	Tom died from a brain hemorrhage.
6261989	eng	We've already discussed this.
6261990	eng	Tom seems to be reluctant to do that for Mary.
6261991	eng	Tom died because of his injuries.
6261992	eng	We'll eat dinner early today.
6261993	eng	Tom seemed to be surprised when Mary did that.
6261994	eng	Tom died Monday at the age of 30.
6261995	eng	We'll do that again sometime.
6261996	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what Mary was doing.
6261997	eng	Tom didn't want to make a speech.
6261998	eng	We were asked not to do that.
6261999	eng	Tom seemed convinced that Mary had to do that.
6262000	eng	Tom didn't want to give a speech.
6262001	eng	We should visit Boston again.
6262002	eng	Tom says that Mary isn't very good at cooking.
6262003	eng	Tom didn't want to do that again.
6262004	eng	We should get out of the way.
6262005	eng	Tom says he won't ask Mary to do that anymore.
6262006	eng	Tom didn't want to dance anymore.
6262007	eng	We should cancel the meeting.
6262008	eng	Tom says he still can't believe Mary did that.
6262009	eng	Tom didn't want any more trouble.
6262010	eng	We often go there on Mondays.
6262011	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary will help him tomorrow.
6262012	eng	Tom didn't think he had a choice.
6262013	eng	We need to know your opinion.
6262014	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary doesn't try to do that.
6262015	eng	Tom didn't show up for breakfast.
6262016	eng	We need to clean the kitchen.
6262017	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary can do that by herself.
6262018	eng	Tom didn't seem to want anything.
6262019	eng	We need more time to do that.
6262020	eng	Tom says he expects Mary to do that on Monday.
6262021	eng	Tom didn't seem to want any help.
6262022	eng	We must've missed each other.
6262023	eng	Tom says he expects Mary to be back on Monday.
6262024	eng	Tom didn't seem to like the food.
6262025	eng	We have to do that right now.
6262026	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to do that with Mary.
6262027	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very upset.
6262028	eng	We had dinner on the veranda.
6262029	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to ask Mary for help.
6262030	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very tired.
6262031	eng	We don't need to go anywhere.
6262032	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary should do that.
6262033	eng	Tom didn't seem to be very angry.
6262034	eng	We don't have to do that now.
6262035	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary has to do that.
6262036	eng	Tom didn't seem to be interested.
6262037	eng	We could do that if we tried.
6262038	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary had to do that.
6262039	eng	Tom didn't seem to be having fun.
6262040	eng	We can be in Boston all week.
6262041	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary wouldn't do that.
6262042	eng	Tom didn't seem to be busy today.
6262043	eng	We both want to study French.
6262044	eng	Tom says Mary is planning to do that tomorrow.
6262045	eng	Tom didn't return my phone calls.
6262046	eng	We both have to study French.
6262047	eng	Tom said the Mary's accident wasn't his fault.
6262048	eng	Tom didn't really seem surprised.
6262049	eng	Wait until Monday to do that.
6262050	eng	Tom said that wasn't what Mary should've done.
6262051	eng	Tom didn't read the instructions.
6262052	eng	This hole needs to be deeper.
6262053	eng	Tom said that Mary would be back home by 2:30.
6262054	eng	Tom didn't look very comfortable.
6262055	eng	This doesn't taste very good.
6262056	eng	Tom said that Mary will go to Boston tomorrow.
6262057	eng	Tom didn't look like he was busy.
6262058	eng	This book is too hard for me.
6262059	eng	Tom said that Mary was still living in Boston.
6262060	eng	Tom didn't listen to his parents.
6262061	eng	They've just made me manager.
6262062	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't know how to do that.
6262063	eng	Tom didn't know a thing about it.
6262064	eng	They pay me a lot to do that.
6262065	eng	Tom said he's very sure Mary needs to do that.
6262066	eng	Tom didn't graduate from Harvard.
6262067	eng	There's only one thing to do.
6262068	eng	Tom said he's glad Mary has finally graduated.
6262069	eng	Tom didn't give a precise answer.
6262070	eng	There's nothing for me to do.
6262071	eng	Tom said he wouldn't mind doing that for Mary.
6262072	eng	Tom didn't expect this to happen.
6262073	eng	There's a tollbooth up ahead.
6262074	eng	Tom said he wished he'd kissed Mary goodnight.
6262075	eng	Tom didn't expect that to happen.
6262076	eng	There's a roadblock up ahead.
6262077	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't argued with Mary.
6262078	eng	Tom didn't even want to go there.
6262079	eng	The team needs a new captain.
6262080	eng	Tom said he was hoping he could cheer Mary up.
6262081	eng	Tom didn't enjoy studying French.
6262082	eng	The situation here is unique.
6262083	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to do that by herself.
6262084	eng	Tom didn't do what he says he did.
6262085	eng	The hall light is burned out.
6262086	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to help Mary.
6262087	eng	Tom didn't do that again, did he?
6262088	eng	The economy is in good shape.
6262090	eng	Tom didn't ask for my permission.
6262091	eng	The captain wants to see you.
6262092	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was going to do that.
6262093	eng	Tom didn't ask even one question.
6262094	eng	The airline lost my suitcase.
6262095	eng	Tom said he left a few minutes after Mary did.
6262096	eng	Tom didn't ask a single question.
6262097	eng	That's the woman I talked to.
6262098	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't do that again.
6262099	eng	Tom didn't appear to be too busy.
6262100	eng	That's the reason I did that.
6262101	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary didn't need to do that.
6262102	eng	Tom didn't acknowledge me at all.
6262103	eng	That's the hat I want to buy.
6262104	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary didn't have to do that.
6262105	eng	Tom did what you asked him to do.
6262106	eng	That's the car I want to buy.
6262107	eng	Tom said he hasn't met any of Mary's brothers.
6262108	eng	Tom did what we wanted him to do.
6262109	eng	That's not what I want to do.
6262110	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary should do that.
6262111	eng	Tom did that pretty much all day.
6262112	eng	That's not what I need to do.
6262113	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that.
6262114	eng	Tom did that not once, but twice.
6262115	eng	That's not what I have to do.
6262116	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary had to do that.
6262117	eng	Tom did that in a couple of days.
6262118	eng	That would change everything.
6262119	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really did that.
6262120	eng	Tom did that as soon as he could.
6262121	eng	Quit asking stupid questions.
6262122	eng	Tom said he didn't like the way Mary did that.
6262123	eng	Tom did his duty, and I did mine.
6262124	eng	Please hand in your homework.
6262125	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary could do that.
6262126	eng	Tom did a good job of leading us.
6262127	eng	Please give me this and this.
6262128	eng	Tom said he couldn't keep Mary for doing that.
6262129	eng	Tom deserves to lose his license.
6262130	eng	Please don't do that so much.
6262131	eng	Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
6262132	eng	Tom deserves that and a lot more.
6262133	eng	Please do that tomorrow, too.
6262134	eng	Tom said Mary would probably do that tomorrow.
6262135	eng	Tom delayed answering the letter.
6262136	eng	Please do that sometime soon.
6262137	eng	Tom said Mary will probably still be confused.
6262138	eng	Tom definitely won't get my vote.
6262139	eng	Perfume sometimes bothers me.
6262140	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't willing to do that again.
6262141	eng	Tom definitely wanted to do that.
6262142	eng	Our troubles aren't over yet.
6262143	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't interested in doing that.
6262144	eng	Tom definitely needed to do that.
6262145	eng	Our flight has been canceled.
6262146	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't happy that John did that.
6262147	eng	Tom decided to do that after all.
6262148	eng	October 20th was a rainy day.
6262149	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to help you do that.
6262150	eng	Tom cut down the tree with an ax.
6262151	eng	No two people react the same.
6262152	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to help him do that.
6262153	eng	Tom currently teaches at Harvard.
6262154	eng	No children were in the park.
6262155	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to do that tomorrow.
6262156	eng	Tom cried when he heard the news.
6262157	eng	My wife died three years ago.
6262158	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to do that for John.
6262159	eng	Tom could retire if he wanted to.
6262160	eng	My suitcase isn't very heavy.
6262161	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to buy that for you.
6262162	eng	Tom could probably do that alone.
6262163	eng	My savings will run out soon.
6262164	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help you today.
6262165	eng	Tom could feel his knees shaking.
6262166	eng	My parents were both doctors.
6262167	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to go any further.
6262168	eng	Tom could die from the infection.
6262169	eng	My old car is still out back.
6262170	eng	Tom said Mary was too out of shape to do that.
6262171	eng	Tom could be studying French now.
6262172	eng	My name is third on the list.
6262173	eng	Tom said Mary was told not to do that anymore.
6262174	eng	Tom could be hesitant to do that.
6262175	eng	My name is still on the list.
6262176	eng	Tom said Mary was the one who did that for us.
6262177	eng	Tom could be forgiven, I suppose.
6262178	eng	My left arm was badly burned.
6262179	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be confused.
6262180	eng	Tom could be doing that tomorrow.
6262181	eng	My house needs to be painted.
6262182	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be home on Monday.
6262183	eng	Tom could be called as a witness.
6262184	eng	My house isn't far from here.
6262185	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping we'd do that for her.
6262186	eng	Tom confined himself to his room.
6262187	eng	My house burned down in 2013.
6262188	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that on her own.
6262189	eng	Tom confessed that he was guilty.
6262190	eng	My help isn't needed anymore.
6262191	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that by herself.
6262192	eng	Tom completed his degree in 2013.
6262193	eng	My grandmother has gray hair.
6262194	eng	Tom said Mary was amused by what was going on.
6262195	eng	Tom complained about the service.
6262196	eng	My grandfather retired early.
6262197	eng	Tom said Mary seemed to be enjoying the party.
6262198	eng	Tom comes to see me now and then.
6262199	eng	My grandfather has gray hair.
6262200	eng	Tom said Mary ought to do that sometime today.
6262201	eng	Tom comes back from Boston today.
6262202	eng	My favorite season is summer.
6262203	eng	Tom said Mary needs to do that sometime today.
6262204	eng	Tom claimed he's never done that.
6262205	eng	My favorite month is October.
6262206	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that.
6262207	eng	Tom can't swim and neither can I.
6262208	eng	My family liked it in Boston.
6262209	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might need to do that.
6262210	eng	Tom can't do anything by himself.
6262211	eng	My contract won't be renewed.
6262212	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that.
6262213	eng	Tom can have everything he wants.
6262214	eng	My car is in the parking lot.
6262215	eng	Tom said Mary isn't usually at home on Monday.
6262216	eng	Tom can do that without any help.
6262217	eng	My car got stuck in the snow.
6262218	eng	Tom said Mary isn't troubled by what happened.
6262219	eng	Tom can do that however he likes.
6262220	eng	My brother is a veterinarian.
6262221	eng	Tom said Mary isn't amused by what's going on.
6262222	eng	Tom can do that for you, I think.
6262223	eng	My birthday is in three days.
6262224	eng	Tom said Mary is willing to help John do that.
6262225	eng	Tom can do that any way he likes.
6262226	eng	My French has improved a lot.
6262227	eng	Tom said Mary is going to ask John to do that.
6262228	eng	Tom can do both at the same time.
6262229	eng	Maybe we should visit Boston.
6262230	eng	Tom said Mary has been told not to do that again.
6262231	eng	Tom came to a similar conclusion.
6262232	eng	Maybe I should do that today.
6262233	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked to do that again.
6262234	eng	Tom came rushing down the stairs.
6262235	eng	Maybe I need to do that, too.
6262236	eng	Tom said Mary frequently does that by herself.
6262237	eng	Tom calls his mother once a week.
6262238	eng	Maybe I have to do that, too.
6262239	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that.
6262240	eng	Tom believes that would be wrong.
6262241	eng	Mary made this dress herself.
6262242	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to do that with him.
6262243	eng	Tom believes that he can do that.
6262244	eng	Let's not study French today.
6262245	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John would do that.
6262246	eng	Tom began performing in the 2013.
6262247	eng	Let's not speak French today.
6262248	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John could do that.
6262249	eng	Tom became a successful reporter.
6262250	eng	Let's go to Boston next week.
6262251	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound entirely convinced.
6262252	eng	Tom asked me why I had done that.
6262253	eng	Let's do that again tomorrow.
6262254	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have any books in French.
6262255	eng	Tom asked me what had to be done.
6262256	eng	Let me go to Boston with you.
6262257	eng	Tom probably knows where Mary went to college.
6262258	eng	Tom asked me to open the windows.
6262259	eng	It's way too late to do that.
6262260	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary was crying.
6262261	eng	Tom asked me to help him do that.
6262262	eng	It's tough to make ends meet.
6262263	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary was born.
6262264	eng	Tom asked me not to do that here.
6262265	eng	It's too late to do that now.
6262266	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is going.
6262267	eng	Tom asked me if he could do that.
6262268	eng	It's too cold to do that now.
6262269	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is hungry.
6262270	eng	Tom asked me if I studied French.
6262271	eng	It's time to stop doing that.
6262272	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary hates him.
6262273	eng	Tom asked for something to drink.
6262274	eng	It's illegal to do that here.
6262275	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary didn't do that.
6262276	eng	Tom appears unwilling to do that.
6262277	eng	It's OK to do that, isn't it?
6262278	eng	Tom must've thought Mary was going to do that.
6262279	eng	Tom apparently wanted to do that.
6262280	eng	It's OK if you don't do that.
6262281	eng	Tom lost his temper and threw his cup at Mary.
6262282	eng	Tom apparently needed to do that.
6262283	eng	It'll be possible to do that.
6262284	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he told her he did that.
6262285	eng	Tom apparently enjoys doing that.
6262286	eng	It'll be good if you do that.
6262287	eng	Tom kept Mary's letters locked in a metal box.
6262288	eng	Tom answered all of my questions.
6262289	eng	It'll be fun to visit Boston.
6262290	eng	Tom is the only person Mary wants to help her.
6262291	eng	Tom announced his plans to leave.
6262292	eng	It would be wrong to do that.
6262293	eng	Tom is the only one who ever really knew Mary.
6262294	eng	Tom and I've just gotten married.
6262295	eng	It would be tough to do that.
6262296	eng	Tom is the one standing between Mary and John.
6262297	eng	Tom and I've decided to break up.
6262298	eng	It would be smart to do that.
6262299	eng	Tom is the guy standing between Mary and John.
6262300	eng	Tom and I've decided not to come.
6262301	eng	It would be silly to do that.
6262302	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that without him.
6262303	eng	Tom and I've become good friends.
6262304	eng	It would be scary to do that.
6262305	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what John is going to do.
6262306	eng	Tom and I've always been friends.
6262307	eng	It would be risky to do that.
6262308	eng	Tom has told Mary to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6262309	eng	Tom and I wrote a paper together.
6262310	eng	It would be cheap to do that.
6262311	eng	Tom has asked Mary to show him how to do that.
6262312	eng	Tom and I work at the same place.
6262313	eng	It was very cruel to do that.
6262314	eng	Tom has already told Mary what she has to buy.
6262315	eng	Tom and I wished each other well.
6262316	eng	It should be safe to do that.
6262317	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he wants to do.
6262318	eng	Tom and I were in the same class.
6262319	eng	Is there water in the bucket?
6262320	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he needs to do.
6262321	eng	Tom and I were alone in the room.
6262322	eng	Is there a desk in your room?
6262323	eng	Tom has already told Mary he wants to do that.
6262324	eng	Tom and I were alone in the cave.
6262325	eng	Is it dangerous if I do that?
6262326	eng	Tom has a guitar that looks a lot like Mary's.
6262327	eng	Tom and I went shopping together.
6262328	eng	If you're sleepy, take a nap.
6262329	eng	Tom had no idea when Mary was going to arrive.
6262330	eng	Tom and I wanted some time alone.
6262331	eng	If it snows, I won't do that.
6262332	eng	Tom forgot to tell Mary what she needed to do.
6262333	eng	Tom and I want to sell our house.
6262334	eng	I've had to postpone my trip.
6262335	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary did that, does he?
6262336	eng	Tom and I stayed up late talking.
6262337	eng	I've got a very bad headache.
6262338	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would let John do that.
6262339	eng	Tom and I spoke at the same time.
6262340	eng	I've found something strange.
6262341	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would enjoy doing that.
6262342	eng	Tom and I split a bottle of wine.
6262343	eng	I've done that several times.
6262344	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will forget to do that.
6262345	eng	Tom and I spent the day together.
6262346	eng	I did that just yesterday.
6262347	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be busy next week.
6262348	eng	Tom and I spent all day together.
6262349	eng	I've decided to visit Boston.
6262350	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is finished doing that.
6262351	eng	Tom and I sometimes jog together.
6262352	eng	I've decided to teach French.
6262353	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary has a driver's license.
6262354	eng	Tom and I seldom help each other.
6262355	eng	I've been waiting since 2:30.
6262356	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary did that intentionally.
6262357	eng	Tom and I sang the song together.
6262358	vie	Mình mới biết Tom đang làm cái gì
6262359	eng	I've been robbed three times.
6262360	eng	Tom doesn't need Mary's permission to do that.
6262361	eng	Tom and I really hate each other.
6262362	eng	I've been ordered to do that.
6262363	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary plays the drums.
6262364	eng	Tom and I rarely go out together.
6262365	eng	I've been doing that all day.
6262366	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary wasn't at his party.
6262367	eng	Tom and I quickly became friends.
6262368	eng	I'm very hesitant to do that.
6262369	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary wants me to do that.
6262370	eng	Tom and I often do that together.
6262371	eng	I'm trying to be cooperative.
6262372	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is tired or not.
6262373	eng	Tom and I need to sell our house.
6262374	eng	I'm too young to get married.
6262375	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary can swim or not.
6262376	eng	Tom and I might do that together.
6262377	eng	I'm too young to drive a car.
6262378	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary thinks he's stupid.
6262379	eng	Tom and I live on the same floor.
6262380	eng	I'm too tired to do that now.
6262381	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends here except Mary.
6262382	eng	Tom and I haven't discussed that.
6262383	eng	I'm too tired to do anything.
6262384	eng	Tom doesn't have Mary's permission to do that.
6262385	eng	Tom and I have to sell our house.
6262386	eng	I'm too depressed to do that.
6262387	eng	Tom didn't want to believe that Mary did that.
6262388	eng	Tom and I hardly know each other.
6262389	eng	I'm to blame for all of this.
6262390	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary could speak French.
6262391	eng	Tom and I got married in October.
6262392	eng	I'm the person who does that.
6262393	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to do that.
6262394	eng	Tom and I got divorced last year.
6262395	eng	I'm sure that'll change soon.
6262396	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was finished doing that.
6262397	eng	Tom and I go to the same dentist.
6262398	eng	I'm sure that you'll like it.
6262399	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he wanted to do that.
6262400	eng	Tom and I eventually got married.
6262401	eng	I'm sure that that'll happen.
6262402	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he needed more money.
6262403	eng	Tom and I enjoy singing together.
6262404	eng	I'm still willing to do that.
6262405	eng	Tom didn't seem to notice what Mary was doing.
6262406	eng	Tom and I don't trust each other.
6262407	eng	I'm quiet whenever I do that.
6262408	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary asked him to do that.
6262409	eng	Tom and I do everything together.
6262410	eng	I'm planning to teach French.
6262411	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was tired or not.
6262412	eng	Tom and I disagree on that point.
6262413	eng	I'm planning to study French.
6262414	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was happy or not.
6262415	eng	Tom and I didn't know what to do.
6262416	eng	I'm planning to speak French.
6262417	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was planning to go.
6262418	eng	Tom and I didn't help each other.
6262419	eng	I'm often invited to parties.
6262420	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary had parked the car.
6262421	eng	Tom and I depended on each other.
6262422	eng	I'm not very sure about that.
6262423	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary had gone to school.
6262424	eng	Tom and I danced with each other.
6262425	eng	I'm not the least bit hungry.
6262426	eng	Tom didn't know when Mary was going to arrive.
6262427	eng	Tom and I can't stand each other.
6262428	eng	I'm not permitted to do that.
6262429	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was married to John.
6262430	eng	Tom and I bumped into each other.
6262431	eng	I'm not in a good mood today.
6262432	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was looking for him.
6262433	eng	Tom and I aren't doing very well.
6262434	eng	I'm not as rich as you think.
6262435	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was engaged to John.
6262436	eng	Tom and I are on the same flight.
6262437	eng	I'm not able to speak French.
6262438	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was able to do that.
6262439	eng	Tom and I are no longer together.
6262440	eng	I'm helping as much as I can.
6262441	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's daughter.
6262442	eng	Tom and I are in the living room.
6262443	eng	I'm happy whenever I do that.
6262444	eng	Tom didn't know how much money Mary had spent.
6262445	eng	Tom and I are having a good time.
6262446	eng	I'm going to have to do that.
6262447	eng	Tom didn't know Mary would do that so quickly.
6262448	eng	Tom and I are from the same town.
6262449	eng	I'm a freelance photographer.
6262450	eng	Tom didn't know Mary had to do that yesterday.
6262451	eng	Tom and I are enjoying ourselves.
6262452	eng	I'll wait for you until 2:30.
6262453	eng	Tom didn't keep his promise not to tease Mary.
6262454	eng	Tom and I agreed with each other.
6262455	eng	I'll show you how to do that.
6262456	eng	Tom didn't do everything Mary asked him to do.
6262457	eng	Tom always yells at his children.
6262458	eng	I'll go to Boston next month.
6262459	eng	Tom convinced Mary that she needed to do that.
6262460	eng	Tom always seems to be talkative.
6262461	eng	I'd rather not do that today.
6262462	eng	Tom asked Mary why she wanted to leave Boston.
6262463	eng	Tom always seems to be impatient.
6262464	eng	I'd rather not do that again.
6262465	eng	Tom asked Mary why she wanted to go to Boston.
6262466	eng	Tom always seems to be exhausted.
6262467	eng	I'd rather do that next week.
6262468	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't need to do that.
6262469	eng	Tom always seems to be confident.
6262470	eng	I'd rather do that by myself.
6262471	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like doing that.
6262472	eng	Tom always said he could do that.
6262473	eng	I'd never ever do that again.
6262474	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't have to do that.
6262475	eng	Tom always gets home before 2:30.
6262476	eng	I'd like to do that with you.
6262477	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to go for a walk.
6262478	eng	Tom always borrows money from me.
6262479	eng	I'd like to do that tomorrow.
6262480	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that today.
6262481	eng	Tom already has plans for Monday.
6262482	eng	I'd like to do that sometime.
6262483	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that today.
6262484	eng	Tom agrees that this makes sense.
6262485	eng	I'd like to buy that for you.
6262486	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to go to a movie together.
6262487	eng	Tom agreed to pick me up at 2:30.
6262488	eng	I'd like both sugar and milk.
6262489	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to go for a walk together.
6262490	eng	Tom actually did that to himself.
6262491	eng	I'd be opposed to doing that.
6262492	eng	Tom and Mary haven't done that in a long time.
6262493	eng	Tom actually did that by himself.
6262494	eng	I wouldn't do that by myself.
6262495	eng	Tom and Mary have decided to do that together.
6262496	eng	Tom accused me of stealing money.
6262497	eng	I would like to visit Boston.
6262498	eng	Tom and Mary don't usually eat the same thing.
6262499	eng	Tom's toys are all made of wood.
6262500	eng	I worked in Boston last year.
6262501	eng	Tom admitted to Mary that he couldn't do that.
6262502	eng	Tom's school has 3,000 students.
6262503	eng	I wonder if I should do that.
6262504	eng	Perhaps Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6262505	eng	Tom's performance was very good.
6262506	eng	I won't try to do that again.
6262507	eng	I'm going to need both Tom and Mary's support.
6262508	eng	Tom's jokes aren't always funny.
6262509	eng	I won't teach French, either.
6262510	eng	I'm glad Tom didn't see Mary and John kissing.
6262511	eng	Tom's house isn't far from here.
6262512	eng	I won't teach French anymore.
6262513	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks Mary needs to do that.
6262514	eng	Tom's going to Boston on Monday.
6262515	eng	I won't study French, either.
6262516	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary can't do that.
6262517	eng	Tom's funeral will be on Monday.
6262518	eng	I won't let you guys do that.
6262519	eng	I wonder if Tom knew that Mary had to do that.
6262520	eng	Tom's friends tried to help him.
6262521	eng	I won't let you go to Boston.
6262522	eng	I think Tom will be able to help Mary do that.
6262523	eng	Tom's friends couldn't help him.
6262524	eng	I won't go to Boston, either.
6262525	eng	I think Tom should try to get Mary to do that.
6262526	eng	Tom's efforts were unsuccessful.
6262527	eng	I won't go to Boston anymore.
6262528	eng	I think Tom should go to Boston to visit Mary.
6262529	eng	Tom's death was ruled a suicide.
6262530	por	O amor é, como a medicina, apenas a arte de ajudar a natureza.
6262531	eng	I won't force you to do that.
6262532	eng	I think Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6262533	eng	Tom's condition hasn't improved.
6262534	eng	I won't do that until Monday.
6262535	eng	I hope Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary.
6262536	eng	Tom wouldn't speak French to me.
6262537	eng	I won't do that anytime soon.
6262538	eng	I don't think Tom would care if Mary did that.
6262539	eng	Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6262540	eng	I won't come to Boston again.
6262541	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary hate each other.
6262542	eng	Tom wouldn't ask you to do that.
6262543	eng	I won't be staying in Boston.
6262544	eng	I don't believe Tom did what Mary said he did.
6262545	eng	Tom would like to buy a new car.
6262546	eng	I wish we had visited Boston.
6262547	eng	I didn't think Tom would enjoy Mary's concert.
6262548	eng	Tom would be willing to do that.
6262549	eng	I wish someone would do that.
6262550	eng	I didn't realize Tom had to help Mary do that.
6262551	eng	Tom would be nervous doing that.
6262552	eng	I wish I were back in Boston.
6262553	eng	I didn't know Tom wanted to help Mary do that.
6262554	eng	Tom would be foolish to do that.
6262555	eng	I wish I hadn't been so late.
6262556	eng	I didn't know Tom needed to help Mary do that.
6262557	eng	Tom would be ashamed to do that.
6262558	eng	I wish I had something to do.
6262559	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
6262560	eng	Tom won't permit you to do that.
6262561	eng	I went to a party last night.
6262562	eng	Fortunately, Tom didn't see Mary kissing John.
6262563	eng	Tom won't likely try to do that.
6262564	eng	I wasn't supposed to do that.
6262565	eng	Do you think Tom would permit Mary to do that?
6262566	eng	Tom won't likely be sympathetic.
6262567	eng	I wasn't in Boston last year.
6262568	eng	Did you know Tom used to have a crush on Mary?
6262569	eng	Tom won't likely be embarrassed.
6262570	eng	I wasn't in Boston last week.
6262571	eng	According to Tom, Mary isn't going to do that.
6262572	eng	Tom won't likely be discouraged.
6262573	eng	I wasn't at school yesterday.
6262574	eng	Why don't you get Tom to ask Mary to do that?
6262575	eng	Tom won't likely be cooperative.
6262576	eng	I wasn't at school last week.
6262577	eng	What Tom said about Mary probably isn't true.
6262578	eng	Tom won't likely be at home yet.
6262579	eng	I wasn't a very good student.
6262580	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he didn't do that.
6262581	eng	Tom won't have to do that alone.
6262582	eng	I was sitting at the counter.
6262583	eng	Tom would never forgive Mary if she did that.
6262584	eng	Tom won't have to do that again.
6262585	eng	I was asked to do that again.
6262586	eng	Tom would do that again if Mary asked him to.
6262587	eng	Tom won't admit that he's wrong.
6262588	eng	I was afraid to speak French.
6262589	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't need to do that.
6262590	eng	Tom will probably pass the exam.
6262591	eng	I wanted to help you do that.
6262592	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't have to do that.
6262593	eng	Tom will probably never do that.
6262594	eng	I wanted to go, but I didn't.
6262595	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't do that anymore.
6262596	eng	Tom will probably do that today.
6262597	eng	I wanted to buy that for you.
6262598	eng	Tom wondered who Mary thought would help her.
6262599	eng	Tom will probably come tomorrow.
6262600	eng	I want you to do that for me.
6262601	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what he has to do.
6262602	eng	Tom will probably be unemployed.
6262603	eng	I want to talk to all of you.
6262604	eng	Tom won't be able to find the money Mary hid.
6262605	eng	Tom will probably be suspicious.
6262606	eng	I want to see you right away.
6262607	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary to go home early.
6262608	eng	Tom will probably be reasonable.
6262609	eng	I want to see you downstairs.
6262610	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to be afraid.
6262611	eng	Tom will probably be handcuffed.
6262612	eng	I want to see you doing that.
6262613	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he won't do that.
6262614	eng	Tom will probably be frightened.
6262615	eng	I want to leave, but I can't.
6262616	eng	Tom wasn't able to teach Mary how to do that.
6262617	eng	Tom will likely be grumpy today.
6262618	eng	I want to go back to college.
6262619	eng	Tom wasn't able to talk Mary into doing that.
6262620	eng	Tom will get married in October.
6262621	eng	I want to do that right away.
6262622	eng	Tom wasn't able to find what Mary had hidden.
6262623	eng	Tom will do that on Monday, too.
6262624	eng	I want to come to your party.
6262625	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary not to do that.
6262626	eng	Tom will do that again tomorrow.
6262627	eng	I want to buy out my partner.
6262628	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary how to do that.
6262629	eng	Tom will be skeptical, I'm sure.
6262630	eng	I want to buy a fishing boat.
6262631	eng	Tom was sure Mary knew she needed to do that.
6262632	eng	Tom will be sarcastic as always.
6262633	eng	I want to buy a Japanese car.
6262634	eng	Tom was kind of surprised that Mary did that.
6262635	eng	Tom will be hesitant to do that.
6262636	eng	I want to build my own house.
6262637	eng	Tom was fortunate that Mary did that for him.
6262638	eng	Tom wasn't very annoyed by that.
6262639	eng	I visited Boston last spring.
6262640	eng	Tom was able to persuade Mary not to do that.
6262641	eng	Tom wasn't permitted to do that.
6262642	eng	I used to study French a lot.
6262643	eng	Tom told me that Mary had decided to do that.
6262644	eng	Tom was tricked into doing that.
6262645	eng	I used to speak French a lot.
6262646	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed to buy a new car.
6262647	eng	Tom was treated at the hospital.
6262648	eng	I tried to do that by myself.
6262649	eng	Tom told Mary to do that as soon as possible.
6262650	eng	Tom was the only person injured.
6262651	eng	I thought it would be better.
6262652	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be unable to do that.
6262653	eng	Tom was the next one to do that.
6262654	eng	I thought I'd try to do that.
6262655	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be likely to do that.
6262656	eng	Tom was the first one to arrive.
6262657	eng	I thought I wouldn't do that.
6262658	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be afraid to do that.
6262659	eng	Tom was punished for doing that.
6262661	eng	Tom told Mary that he was too drunk to drive.
6262662	eng	Tom was my first French teacher.
6262663	eng	I think that I won't do that.
6262664	eng	Tom told Mary that he was through doing that.
6262665	eng	Tom was mugged again last night.
6262666	eng	I think it's time to give up.
6262667	eng	Tom told Mary that he was tempted to do that.
6262668	eng	Tom was hoping he could do that.
6262669	eng	I still want to study French.
6262670	eng	Tom told Mary that he was obliged to do that.
6262671	eng	Tom was held in the county jail.
6262672	eng	I still want to speak French.
6262673	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was pretty.
6262674	eng	Tom was going to do that anyway.
6262675	eng	I still plan to teach French.
6262676	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was biased.
6262677	eng	Tom was finally able to do that.
6262678	eng	I still plan to study French.
6262679	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was upset.
6262680	eng	Tom was excused from doing that.
6262681	eng	I still need to buy dog food.
6262682	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was tired.
6262683	eng	Tom was being forced to do that.
6262684	eng	I still haven't paid my rent.
6262685	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was right.
6262686	eng	Tom was arrested for doing that.
6262687	eng	I still haven't eaten dinner.
6262688	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was ready.
6262689	eng	Tom was able to get his own way.
6262690	eng	I still have to pay the bill.
6262691	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was pushy.
6262692	eng	Tom was a great influence on me.
6262693	eng	I started doing that in 2013.
6262694	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was lucky.
6262695	eng	Tom wants me to give him a loan.
6262696	eng	I spent the day at the beach.
6262697	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was funny.
6262698	eng	Tom wanted to make a difference.
6262699	eng	I sometimes do that even now.
6262700	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was drunk.
6262701	eng	Tom wanted to buy a cheaper car.
6262702	eng	I should've never been fired.
6262703	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was crazy.
6262704	eng	Tom usually goes to work by car.
6262705	eng	I should've done that sooner.
6262706	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was broke.
6262707	eng	Tom uses crutches to get around.
6262708	eng	I should've done that myself.
6262709	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was brave.
6262710	eng	Tom used to drink a lot of milk.
6262711	eng	I should've done much better.
6262712	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was bossy.
6262713	eng	Tom used to do that quite often.
6262714	eng	I should've been helping you.
6262715	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was bored.
6262716	eng	Tom turned right on Park Street.
6262717	eng	I should've been able to win.
6262718	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was awake.
6262719	eng	Tom tried to speak French to us.
6262720	eng	I should be back before 2:30.
6262721	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was angry.
6262722	eng	Tom tried to get out of the way.
6262723	eng	I saw a UFO three nights ago.
6262724	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was alone.
6262725	eng	Tom tried not to make any noise.
6262726	eng	I remember when you did that.
6262727	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was alive.
6262728	eng	Tom tried not to look surprised.
6262729	eng	I regretted having done that.
6262730	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was cute.
6262731	eng	Tom tried doing that by himself.
6262732	eng	I regret not studying French.
6262733	eng	Tom told Mary that John had been disobedient.
6262734	eng	Tom told us he wouldn't do that.
6262735	eng	I really should study French.
6262736	eng	Tom told Mary that John had been cooperative.
6262737	eng	Tom told us he couldn't do that.
6262738	eng	I really don't have a choice.
6262739	eng	Tom told Mary it was safe for her to do that.
6262740	eng	Tom told the judge he was sorry.
6262741	eng	I plan to live there someday.
6262742	eng	Tom thought Mary would be tempted to do that.
6262743	eng	Tom told me the road was closed.
6262744	eng	I ought to do that by myself.
6262745	eng	Tom thought Mary would be nervous doing that.
6262746	eng	Tom told me that he's terrified.
6262747	eng	I never felt like doing that.
6262748	eng	Tom thought Mary would be frightened by that.
6262749	eng	Tom told me that he's skeptical.
6262750	eng	I need you to come to Boston.
6262751	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't interested in sports.
6262752	eng	Tom told me that he's irritated.
6262753	eng	I need to borrow an umbrella.
6262754	eng	Tom thought Mary was the last one to do that.
6262755	eng	Tom told me that he's exhausted.
6262756	eng	I need to be told what to do.
6262757	eng	Tom thinks that Mary is the one who did that.
6262758	eng	Tom told me that he's depressed.
6262759	eng	I might need to study French.
6262760	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6262761	eng	Tom told me that he'd done that.
6262762	eng	I might need to speak French.
6262763	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be hesitant to do that.
6262764	eng	Tom told me that I was mistaken.
6262765	eng	I might have to study French.
6262766	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be reluctant to do that.
6262767	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't do that.
6262768	eng	I looked in the refrigerator.
6262769	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be motivated to do that.
6262770	eng	Tom told me he hated doing that.
6262771	eng	I like stir-fried vegetables.
6262772	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that with John.
6262773	eng	Tom told me I shouldn't do that.
6262774	eng	I know you'd hate to do that.
6262775	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that very soon.
6262776	eng	Tom thinks you wouldn't do that.
6262777	eng	I know you understand French.
6262778	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be desperate to do that.
6262779	eng	Tom thinks that he's a big shot.
6262780	eng	I know you shouldn't do that.
6262781	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be awake until midnight.
6262782	eng	Tom thinks that he can prove it.
6262783	eng	I know you shouldn't be here.
6262784	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be at home this evening.
6262785	eng	Tom thinks he shouldn't do that.
6262786	eng	I know why you're suspicious.
6262787	eng	Tom thinks Mary wasn't in Boston last summer.
6262788	eng	Tom still hasn't washed his car.
6262789	eng	I know why I need to do that.
6262790	eng	Tom thinks Mary is amused by what's going on.
6262791	eng	Tom still hasn't mowed the lawn.
6262792	eng	I know why I have to do that.
6262793	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary wants to do.
6262794	eng	Tom still has a house in Boston.
6262795	eng	I know what the situation is.
6262796	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary needs to do.
6262797	eng	Tom still does that, doesn't he?
6262798	eng	I know what ought to be done.
6262799	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6262800	eng	Tom still does that quite often.
6262801	eng	I know what I'm getting into.
6262802	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he needs her to do.
6262803	eng	Tom still can't drive very well.
6262804	eng	I know the police suspect me.
6262805	eng	Tom should tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
6262806	eng	Tom started his blog in October.
6262807	eng	I know the job won't be easy.
6262808	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary how to do that.
6262809	eng	Tom spent the whole day walking.
6262810	eng	I know that you aren't ready.
6262811	eng	Tom should probably show Mary how to do that.
6262812	eng	Tom slept most of the afternoon.
6262813	eng	I know that I'll be punished.
6262814	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary to do that.
6262815	eng	Tom showed us a few card tricks.
6262816	eng	I know that I'll be arrested.
6262817	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he's tired.
6262818	eng	Tom showed me how to copy files.
6262819	eng	I know that I should do that.
6262820	eng	Tom should be faster at doing that than Mary.
6262821	eng	Tom shouldn't be doing that now.
6262822	eng	I know it won't happen again.
6262823	eng	Tom seems convinced that Mary has to do that.
6262824	eng	Tom should've done that with us.
6262825	eng	I know exactly what happened.
6262826	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what Mary had done.
6262827	eng	Tom should've done that with me.
6262828	eng	I know everyone here by name.
6262829	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary would really do that.
6262830	eng	Tom should've done that himself.
6262831	eng	I know a lot about computers.
6262832	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't want to do that.
6262833	eng	Tom should've called the police.
6262834	eng	I know a lot about Australia.
6262835	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't need to do that.
6262836	eng	Tom should've brought more food.
6262837	eng	I know I'm going to be fired.
6262838	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't have to do that.
6262839	eng	Tom should've been more careful.
6262840	eng	I know I'll be here tomorrow.
6262841	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't need to do that.
6262842	eng	Tom should've been found guilty.
6262843	eng	I know I did something wrong.
6262844	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't have to do that.
6262845	eng	Tom should've arrived yesterday.
6262846	eng	I just did that this morning.
6262847	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary wants to do that, too.
6262848	eng	Tom should go ahead and do that.
6262849	eng	I just did that a moment ago.
6262850	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary is willing to do that.
6262851	eng	Tom should be safe here with us.
6262852	eng	I just can't do that anymore.
6262853	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary can help him tomorrow.
6262854	eng	Tom should be getting paid more.
6262855	eng	I intend to do that tomorrow.
6262856	eng	Tom says he heard Mary cracking her knuckles.
6262857	eng	Tom shot and killed both tigers.
6262858	eng	I intend to buy that for you.
6262859	eng	Tom says he forgot to remind Mary to do that.
6262860	eng	Tom shaved his head last summer.
6262861	eng	I hope you pass today's exam.
6262862	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would do that.
6262863	eng	Tom seems to have recognized me.
6262864	eng	I hope to see you in October.
6262865	eng	Tom says he doesn't know where Mary did that.
6262866	eng	Tom seems to be very happy here.
6262867	eng	I hope to see you again soon.
6262868	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what Mary should do.
6262869	eng	Tom seemed unwilling to do that.
6262870	eng	I hope to live there someday.
6262871	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what Mary has to do.
6262872	eng	Tom seemed to know who did that.
6262873	eng	I hope to do that eventually.
6262874	eng	Tom says he and Mary seldom eat out together.
6262875	eng	Tom seemed to do that just fine.
6262876	eng	I hope to become a carpenter.
6262877	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't doing that anymore.
6262878	eng	Tom seemed to be busy yesterday.
6262879	eng	I helped because I wanted to.
6262880	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to see the manager.
6262881	eng	Tom says you've got a big mouth.
6262882	eng	I haven't yet visited Boston.
6262883	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to see the manager.
6262884	eng	Tom says that he teaches French.
6262885	eng	I haven't yet confirmed that.
6262886	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to be more careful.
6262887	eng	Tom says that he studies French.
6262888	eng	I haven't stopped doing that.

6262891	eng	I haven't ever taught French.
6262892	eng	Tom said it was Mary who told him to do that.
6262893	eng	Tom says that he didn't do that.
6262894	eng	I haven't done that recently.
6262895	eng	Tom said he's looking forward to seeing Mary.
6262896	eng	Tom says no teachers were there.
6262897	eng	I haven't actually done that.
6262898	eng	Tom said he's determined to do that for Mary.
6262899	eng	Tom says he's hoping to do that.
6262900	eng	I have to go to Boston today.
6262901	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why Mary did that.
6262902	eng	Tom says he's afraid to do that.
6262903	eng	I have to get my car painted.
6262904	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to do that for Mary.
6262905	eng	Tom says he'll do that tomorrow.
6262906	eng	I have to buy a new computer.

6262920	eng	Tom says he won't do that again.
6262921	eng	I had enough time to do that.
6262922	eng	Tom said he isn't going to Mary's party tonight.
6262923	eng	Tom says he never taught French.
6262924	eng	I finally managed to do that.
6262925	eng	Tom said he hopes Mary won't want to do that.
6262926	eng	Tom says he has to study French.
6262927	eng	I feel like doing that today.

6262938	eng	Tom says he had a great weekend.
6262940	eng	Tom said he expects Mary to help him do that.
6262941	eng	Tom says he finished doing that.

6262964	eng	Tom said Mary wouldn't permit him to do that.
6262965	eng	Tom said you have to be careful.

6262967	eng	Tom said Mary will probably do that tomorrow.
6262968	eng	Tom said we should take a break.
6262969	eng	I don't want to go by myself.
6262970	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't good at speaking French.
6262971	eng	Love is, like medicine, only the art of helping nature.
6262972	eng	Tom said this year has been fun.
6262973	eng	I don't want to be a teacher.
6262974	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't excused from doing that.

6262981	eng	Tom said that's simply not true.
6262982	eng	I don't want any more to eat.
6262983	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to do that for you.
6262984	eng	Tom said that's not what he did.
6262985	eng	I don't usually wear pajamas.
6262986	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help us today.
6262987	eng	Tom said that's not good enough.
6262988	eng	I don't think you'll do that.
6262989	eng	Tom said Mary was told to do that by herself.
6262990	eng	I don't think we can do this.
6262991	eng	Tom said Mary was the one who had to do that.
6262992	eng	Tom said that wasn't the reason.
6262993	eng	I don't think Mary is pretty.
6262994	eng	Tom said Mary was talking to John on the bus.
6262995	eng	Tom said that it'll happen soon.
6262996	eng	I don't think I'll be scared.

6263011	eng	I don't study French anymore.
6263012	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be at home.
6263013	eng	Tom said that he studied French.
6263014	eng	I don't see why I have to go.
6263015	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be in Boston now.
6263016	eng	Tom said that he didn't do that.
6263017	eng	I don't remember my password.

6263035	eng	Tom said he's home every Monday.
6263036	eng	I don't owe anybody anything.
6263037	eng	Tom said Mary wanted John to do that for her.
6263038	eng	Tom said he's glad you did that.
6263039	eng	I don't often take vacations.

6263055	eng	Tom said Mary is willing to help him do that.
6263056	eng	Tom said he'll do that tomorrow.
6263057	eng	I don't need to buy anything.
6263058	eng	Tom said Mary is willing to do that for John.
6263059	eng	Tom said he'll buy that for you.
6263060	eng	I don't mind speaking French.

6263156	eng	I don't feel anything at all.
6263157	eng	Tom is the only person who can help Mary now.

6263165	eng	I don't eat fruit very often.
6263166	eng	Tom hasn't told Mary why he wants to do that.
6263167	eng	Tom probably should do that now.
6263168	eng	I don't care how you do that.
6263169	eng	Tom has told Mary she needs to wear a helmet.
6263170	eng	Tom probably isn't swimming now.
6263171	eng	I don't believe you did that.
6263172	eng	Tom has already told Mary what she has to do.
6263173	eng	Tom probably can't speak French.
6263174	eng	I do that every chance I get.

6263182	eng	Tom plans to live there someday.
6263183	eng	I didn't want to leave early.
6263184	eng	Tom explained to Mary why she had to do that.
6263185	eng	Tom ought to have spoken French.
6263186	eng	I didn't want to kill anyone.
6263187	eng	Tom eventually told Mary that he'd done that.
6263188	eng	Tom only swears when he's angry.

6263199	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would need to do that.
6263200	eng	Tom often got bullied at school.
6263201	eng	I didn't think you'd noticed.
6263202	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would like to do that.
6263203	eng	Tom often goes there by himself.
6263204	eng	I didn't think you'd be late.
6263205	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would like doing that.

6263210	eng	I didn't think you were busy.
6263211	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would let him do that.
6263212	eng	Tom never gets home before 2:30.
6263213	eng	I didn't think that was fair.
6263214	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would have to do that.
6263215	eng	Tom never finishes his homework.
6263216	eng	I didn't think I'd get fired.
6263217	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will do that tomorrow.

6263219	eng	I didn't think I'd be scared.

6263224	eng	Tom needs to take one more test.
6263225	eng	I didn't stay there for long.
6263226	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will agree to do that.
6263227	eng	Tom needs to borrow an umbrella.
6263228	eng	I didn't report the accident.

6263233	eng	Tom needed to be home on Monday.
6263234	eng	I didn't like that very much.
6263235	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is through doing that.
6263236	eng	Tom must've done that yesterday.
6263237	eng	I didn't know you were drunk.
6263238	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is allowed to do that.
6263239	eng	Tom must've been busy yesterday.
6263240	eng	I didn't know who to believe.
6263241	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can understand French.
6263242	eng	Tom must be hesitant to do that.
6263243	eng	I didn't know what was wrong.
6263244	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can do that that soon.
6263245	eng	Tom might study French tomorrow.
6263246	eng	I didn't know how to proceed.
6263247	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary has to do.
6263248	eng	Tom might not come to the party.
6263249	eng	I didn't know how bad it was.
6263250	eng	Tom doesn't need to tell Mary how to do that.
6263251	eng	Tom may do that if he'd like to.
6263252	eng	I didn't keep my appointment.
6263253	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary smiles at John.

6263261	eng	I didn't have any cash on me.
6263262	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary shouldn't do that.
6263263	eng	Tom looked like he wasn't tired.
6263264	eng	I didn't go to Boston either.
6263265	eng	Tom doesn't know how Mary managed to do that.
6263266	eng	Tom looked like he wasn't happy.
6263267	eng	I didn't get up early enough.
6263268	eng	Tom doesn't have to tell Mary how to do that.
6263269	eng	Tom likes going to kindergarten.
6263270	eng	I didn't get rich doing that.
6263271	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that. Mary will do it.
6263272	eng	Tom likely won't be cooperative.
6263273	eng	I didn't get paid last month.
6263274	eng	Tom does almost anything Mary asks him to do.
6263275	eng	Tom left at 2:30 in the morning.
6263276	eng	I didn't get home until dawn.
6263277	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be upset by that.
6263278	eng	Tom left all the windows closed.
6263279	eng	I didn't get here until 2:30.
6263280	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be in her office.
6263281	eng	Tom leafed through the magazine.
6263282	eng	I didn't feel very confident.
6263283	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was through doing that.
6263284	eng	Tom knows what ought to be done.
6263285	eng	I didn't feel the earthquake.
6263286	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was nervous doing that.
6263287	eng	Tom knows what he's looking for.
6263288	eng	I didn't feel safe in Boston.
6263289	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was doing that anymore.
6263290	eng	Tom knows what he did was wrong.
6263291	eng	I didn't even try to do that.
6263292	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he had to work late.
6263293	eng	Tom knows the job won't be easy.
6263294	eng	I didn't do well on the test.
6263295	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she needed to know.

6263297	eng	I didn't do that fast enough.
6263298	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6263299	eng	Tom kept me waiting all morning.
6263300	eng	I didn't come here yesterday.
6263301	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary that he wanted her help.
6263302	eng	Tom just does what he has to do.
6263303	eng	I didn't apologize in French.
6263304	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was busy or not.
6263305	eng	Tom isn't working much nowadays.
6263306	eng	I did the same thing in 2013.
6263307	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary had put in the box.
6263308	eng	Tom isn't quite sure what to do.
6263309	eng	I did that just this morning.
6263310	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's ex-wife.
6263311	eng	Tom isn't on the wrestling team.
6263312	eng	I couldn't do that by myself.
6263313	eng	Tom didn't know if Mary would do that or not.
6263314	eng	Tom isn't likely like to be shy.
6263315	eng	I could never live in Boston.
6263316	eng	Tom didn't know if Mary could do that or not.
6263317	eng	Tom isn't likely doing that now.
6263318	eng	I could do that if wanted to.
6263319	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wasn't going to do that.
6263320	eng	Tom isn't going to be here long.
6263321	eng	I come to Boston quite a lot.
6263322	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to do that.
6263323	eng	Tom isn't going to be gone long.
6263324	eng	I can't wait to visit Boston.
6263325	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to help us.
6263326	eng	Tom isn't ever going to do that.
6263327	eng	I can't wait to go to Boston.
6263328	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to do that.
6263329	eng	Tom isn't doing that any longer.
6263330	eng	I can't play chess very well.
6263331	eng	Tom couldn't believe that Mary could do that.
6263332	eng	Tom isn't coming back to Boston.
6263333	eng	I can't do everything myself.
6263334	eng	Tom could try to get Mary to stop doing that.
6263335	eng	Tom isn't able to do that today.
6263336	eng	I can't afford to retire yet.
6263337	eng	Tom could probably teach Mary how to do that.
6263338	eng	Tom is way too young to do that.
6263339	eng	I can go to Boston next week.
6263340	eng	Tom could probably talk Mary into doing that.
6263341	eng	Tom is very sure he can do that.
6263342	eng	I can eat wherever I want to.
6263343	eng	Tom could likely talk Mary out of doing that.
6263344	eng	Tom is very happy to have a job.
6263345	eng	I can eat whenever I want to.
6263346	eng	Tom could be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6263347	eng	Tom is very devoted to his wife.
6263348	eng	I can eat whatever I want to.
6263349	eng	Tom asked me if I thought Mary could do that.
6263350	eng	Tom is used to eating cold rice.
6263351	eng	I bought a house with a pool.
6263352	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like gardening.
6263353	eng	Tom is used to doing that alone.
6263354	eng	I almost didn't visit Boston.
6263355	eng	Tom asked Mary what she'd do if she were him.
6263356	eng	Tom is trying to manipulate you.
6263357	eng	I advise you to study French.
6263358	eng	Tom asked Mary what her favorite subject was.
6263359	eng	Tom is too upset to do that now.
6263360	eng	How was the dance last night?
6263361	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew why John was late.
6263362	eng	Tom is too tired to do that now.
6263363	eng	How often have you done that?
6263364	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew where John worked.
6263365	eng	Tom is too drunk to do that now.
6263366	eng	How often do you go downtown?
6263367	eng	Tom apologized to Mary for being so careless.
6263368	eng	Tom is too broke to do that now.
6263369	eng	How often do you buy flowers?
6263370	eng	Tom and Mary plan to get married next summer.
6263371	eng	Tom is too angry to do that now.
6263372	eng	How much should they be paid?
6263373	eng	Tom and Mary aren't the only ones doing that.
6263374	eng	Tom is the strongest man I know.
6263375	eng	How much did your watch cost?
6263376	eng	Tom and Mary are unlikely to want to do that.
6263377	eng	Tom is the strongest guy I know.
6263378	eng	How much did your shoes cost?
6263379	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is going to wait for us.
6263380	eng	Tom is the man I told you about.
6263381	eng	How many pencils did you buy?
6263382	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't permit Mary to do that.
6263383	eng	Tom is taller than his brothers.
6263384	eng	How many cousins do you have?
6263385	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach Mary how to do that.
6263386	eng	Tom is talking with his friends.
6263387	eng	How many cookies do you want?
6263388	eng	I wonder why Tom thought Mary had to do that.
6263389	eng	Tom is sure he needs to do that.
6263390	eng	How many bananas did you eat?
6263391	eng	I told Tom that I thought Mary could do that.
6263392	eng	Tom is supposed to be in Boston.
6263393	eng	How many bananas did you buy?
6263394	eng	I thought Tom would be able to cheer Mary up.
6263395	eng	Tom is still willing to do that.
6263396	eng	How many apples did you pick?
6263397	eng	I hope Tom is faster at doing that than Mary.
6263398	eng	Tom is still too young to drink.
6263399	eng	How did you meet that friend?
6263400	eng	I don't think Tom would've said that to Mary.
6263401	eng	Tom is still getting into shape.
6263402	eng	Have you finished doing that?
6263403	eng	I don't think Tom will allow Mary to do that.
6263404	eng	Tom is seldom at home on Monday.
6263405	eng	Have you ever studied French?
6263406	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that with Mary.
6263407	eng	Tom is reluctant not to do that.
6263408	eng	Have you ever eaten dog meat?
6263409	eng	I don't think Tom should ask Mary to do that.

6263411	eng	Everybody did that except me.
6263412	vie	Con mèo đen chạy nhanh thế.
6263413	vie	Không ai đưa mình đi đâu cả.
6263414	eng	I don't believe the rumor about Tom and Mary.
6263415	eng	Tom is rarely at home on Monday.
6263416	eng	Don't forget your sunglasses.
6263417	eng	I do think Tom shouldn't ask Mary to do that.
6263418	eng	Tom is one of my former clients.
6263419	eng	Don't forget to mow the lawn.
6263420	eng	I didn't tell Tom why Mary didn't want to go.
6263421	eng	Tom is older than he says he is.
6263422	eng	Doing that's a very bad idea.
6263423	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's ex-husband.
6263424	eng	Tom is often the first one here.
6263425	eng	Doing that would be romantic.
6263426	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary were related.
6263427	eng	Tom is mad at me for doing that.
6263428	eng	Doing that won't be much fun.
6263429	eng	Does Tom still go out with Mary every Monday?
6263430	eng	Tom is likely to try to do that.
6263431	eng	Doing that is very important.
6263432	eng	Do you think Tom will permit Mary to do that?
6263433	eng	Tom is likely to still be upset.
6263434	eng	Doing that here is dangerous.

6263440	eng	Do you still wish to do that?
6263441	eng	Are Tom and Mary still married to each other?
6263442	eng	Tom is likely to still be bored.

6263450	eng	Tom would do that for Mary, I'm pretty sure.
6263451	eng	Tom is likely to still be alive.
6263452	eng	Do you play soccer every day?
6263453	eng	Tom wondered who Mary used to be married to.
6263454	eng	Tom is likely to become violent.
6263455	eng	Do you enjoy teaching French?
6263456	eng	Tom wondered if Mary would do that for John.
6263457	eng	Tom is likely to be unimpressed.
6263458	eng	Do you drink a lot of coffee?
6263459	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary to go home early.
6263460	eng	Tom is likely to be sympathetic.
6263461	eng	Do both of you still do that?
6263462	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he won't do that.
6263463	eng	Tom is likely to be pessimistic.
6263464	eng	Didn't you intend to do that?
6263465	eng	Tom won't do that without Mary's permission.
6263466	eng	Tom is likely to be intoxicated.
6263467	eng	Didn't you do that yesterday?
6263469	eng	Tom is likely to be heartbroken.
6263470	eng	Did you have a good vacation?
6263471	eng	Tom will never permit Mary to do that again.
6263472	eng	Tom is likely to be embarrassed.
6263473	eng	Did I really have to do that?
6263474	eng	Tom will likely talk Mary out of doing that.
6263475	eng	Tom is likely to be disobedient.
6263476	eng	Could you go get that for me?
6263477	eng	Tom will likely be glad to see Mary do that.

6263481	eng	Tom is likely to be cooperative.
6263482	eng	Can you speak French, please?
6263483	eng	Tom wasn't able to persuade Mary to do that.
6263484	eng	Tom is interested in doing that.
6263485	eng	Can you remember their names?
6263486	eng	Tom was the one who advised Mary to do that.
6263487	eng	Tom is hoping to make a fortune.
6263488	eng	Can you help me next weekend?
6263489	eng	Tom was impressed by how well Mary did that.
6263490	eng	Tom is halfway to Boston by now.
6263491	eng	Both of my brothers did that.
6263492	eng	Tom took several pictures of Mary's parents.
6263493	eng	Tom is gradually getting better.
6263494	eng	At what time did you do that?
6263495	eng	Tom told me Mary didn't know how to do that.
6263496	eng	Tom is going to quit doing that.
6263498	eng	Tom told Mary why he wasn't able to do that.
6263499	eng	Tom is glad to be healthy again.
6263500	eng	Are you proposing we do that?

6263510	eng	Tom told Mary that he was afraid to do that.
6263511	eng	Tom is coming over this evening.
6263512	eng	Are you permitted to do that?
6263513	eng	Tom told Mary that he wanted her to do that.
6263514	eng	Tom is carrying a black satchel.
6263515	eng	Are you miserable doing that?
6263516	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was pushy.
6263517	eng	Tom is better than I used to be.
6263518	eng	Are you hesitant to go there?
6263519	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was well.
6263520	eng	Tom is an experienced announcer.
6263521	eng	Are you going to do that now?
6263522	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was weak.
6263523	eng	Tom is actually a very sick man.

6263897	eng	What do you two do together?
6263898	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be groggy.
6263899	eng	Tom didn't sound too optimistic.
6263900	eng	What did you do last Monday?
6263901	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be afraid.
6263902	eng	Tom didn't seem to be surprised.
6263903	eng	What did you do after lunch?
6263904	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be undependable.
6263905	eng	Tom didn't seem to be impressed.
6263906	eng	What color do you like best?
6263907	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that tomorrow.
6263908	eng	Tom didn't see the truck coming.
6263909	eng	What are you most afraid of?
6263910	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that for John.
6263911	eng	Tom didn't say he would do that.
6263912	eng	We've both worked in Boston.
6263913	eng	Tom said Mary was determined not to do that.
6263914	eng	Tom didn't recommend doing that.
6263915	eng	We've been asked to do that.
6263916	eng	Tom said Mary wanted him to do that for her.
6263917	eng	Tom didn't react quickly enough.
6263918	eng	We're trying to do too much.
6263919	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed so long.
6263920	eng	Tom didn't permit us to do that.
6263921	eng	We'd better do that quickly.
6263922	eng	Tom said Mary should've helped John do that.
6263923	eng	Tom didn't know about the party.
6263924	eng	We won't ever do that again.
6263925	eng	Tom said Mary should've done that last week.
6263926	eng	Tom didn't have to speak French.
6263927	eng	We were too busy to do that.
6263928	eng	Tom said Mary should've asked John for help.
6263929	eng	Tom didn't expect to walk again.
6263930	eng	We were told not to do that.
6263931	eng	Tom said Mary should do that someplace else.
6263932	eng	Tom didn't eat all of the ice cream.
6263933	eng	We were in Boston yesterday.
6263934	eng	Tom said Mary only does that in the morning.
6263935	eng	Tom didn't do that the easy way.
6263936	eng	We want you to go to Boston.
6263937	eng	Tom said Mary needed to do that pretty soon.
6263938	eng	Tom didn't do that deliberately.
6263939	eng	We waited for you yesterday.
6263940	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might want to do that.
6263941	eng	Tom didn't dare to say anything.
6263942	eng	We visited Boston last week.
6263943	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might need to do that.
6263944	eng	Tom did what you told him to do.
6263945	eng	We should've studied harder.
6263946	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might have to do that.
6263947	eng	Tom did what we asked him to do.
6263948	eng	We should be in Boston soon.
6263949	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still very hungry.
6263950	eng	Tom did what he felt like doing.
6263951	eng	We seldom speak French here.
6263952	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still unconvinced.
6263953	eng	Tom did that exceptionally well.
6263954	eng	We live in different cities.
6263955	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still pessimistic.
6263956	eng	Tom did that at the last minute.
6263957	eng	We have nothing to left eat.
6263958	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still in her room.
6263959	eng	Tom devoted his life to science.
6263960	eng	We didn't have enough money.
6263961	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still heartbroken.
6263962	eng	Tom definitely wants to do that.
6263963	eng	We didn't do that yesterday.
6263964	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still embarrassed.
6263965	eng	Tom definitely plans to do that.
6263966	eng	We can't come to Boston now.
6263967	eng	Tom said Mary has to do that sometime today.
6263968	eng	Tom definitely needs to do that.
6263969	eng	We came to Boston yesterday.
6263970	eng	Tom said Mary has never driven a sports car.
6263971	eng	Tom could've refused to do that.
6263972	eng	Wait for me at the entrance.
6263973	eng	Tom said Mary has been trying to be careful.
6263974	eng	Tom could've died of starvation.
6263975	eng	Try to do that by all means.
6263976	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked not to do that.
6263977	eng	Tom could tell you who did that.
6263978	eng	This is the time to do that.
6263979	eng	Tom said Mary hardly ever does that anymore.
6263980	eng	Tom could probably teach French.
6263981	eng	This hole isn't deep enough.
6263982	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that sometime today.
6263983	eng	Tom could end up being arrested.
6263984	eng	This book isn't interesting.
6263985	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't need to do that today.
6263986	eng	Tom could easily have done that.
6263987	eng	This area has changed a lot.
6263988	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to do that today.
6263989	eng	Tom could do it if he wanted to.
6263990	eng	They're testing new weapons.
6263991	eng	Tom said I should've stayed and helped Mary.
6263992	eng	Tom could become very rich soon.
6263993	eng	They're often seen together.
6263994	eng	Tom quickly wrote down everything Mary said.
6263995	eng	Tom could be stranded somewhere.
6263996	eng	They both speak French well.
6263997	eng	Tom promised Mary he wouldn't do that again.
6263998	eng	Tom claims that it was my fault.
6263999	eng	They both did that together.
6264000	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary did that.
6264001	eng	Tom claimed he tried to do that.
6264002	eng	These trousers are too long.
6264003	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is now.
6264004	eng	Tom chuckled and shook his head.
6264005	eng	These books used to be mine.
6264006	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is busy.
6264007	eng	Tom can do that without my help.
6264008	eng	There's plenty of wine left.
6264009	eng	Tom must've thought Mary could speak French.
6264010	eng	Tom began to yell at his mother.
6264011	eng	There's no way I'll do that.
6264012	eng	Tom let Mary know that he wanted to do that.
6264013	eng	Tom began doing that last month.
6264014	eng	There's no rush. I can wait.
6264015	eng	Tom let Mary know he didn't know what to do.
6264016	eng	Tom became an ordained minister.
6264017	eng	There's no news from Boston.
6264018	eng	Tom knows that Mary shouldn't be doing that.
6264019	eng	Tom asked me to vacuum the room.
6264020	eng	The rain hasn't stopped yet.
6264021	eng	Tom knows that Mary is the one who did that.
6264022	eng	Tom asked me to stop doing that.
6264023	eng	The noise doesn't bother me.
6264024	eng	Tom is the only person Mary says she trusts.
6264025	eng	Tom asked me to do this for him.
6264026	eng	The movie is about to begin.
6264027	eng	Tom is the guy over there talking with Mary.
6264028	eng	Tom asked me to do that quietly.
6264029	eng	The economy is in bad shape.
6264030	eng	Tom is sure Mary knew she needed to do that.
6264031	eng	Tom asked me to do that quickly.
6264032	eng	The children are downstairs.
6264033	eng	Tom is still determined to do that for Mary.
6264034	eng	Tom asked me if I taught French.
6264035	eng	That idea sounds good to me.
6264036	eng	Tom is standing behind Mary in this picture.
6264037	eng	Tom asked me if I had done that.
6264039	eng	Tom is reluctant to do that, but Mary isn't.
6264040	eng	Tom asked me if I could do that.
6264041	eng	That could happen next week.
6264042	eng	Tom is permitted to do that, but Mary isn't.
6264043	eng	Tom asked for police protection.
6264044	eng	That appears to be the plan.
6264045	eng	Tom is going to be very happy Mary did that.
6264046	eng	Tom apparently wants to do that.
6264047	eng	Shouldn't you do that today?
6264048	eng	Tom is counting the days until Mary arrives.
6264049	eng	Tom apparently needs to do that.
6264050	eng	Shouldn't you be doing that?
6264051	eng	Tom informed Mary why she needed to do that.
6264052	eng	Tom and his friends are outside.
6264053	eng	Quite a few people did that.
6264054	eng	Tom hopes that Mary will be able to do that.
6264055	eng	Tom and I were wrong about that.
6264056	eng	Please remind me to do that.
6264057	eng	Tom hoped Mary would be well enough to come.
6264058	eng	Tom and I were also in the room.
6264059	eng	Please go ahead and do that.
6264060	eng	Tom has told Mary to do that more than once.
6264061	eng	Tom and I went sailing together.
6264062	eng	Our flight has been delayed.
6264063	eng	Tom has told Mary that she needs to do that.
6264064	eng	Tom and I went camping together.
6264065	eng	My visa needs to be renewed.
6264066	eng	Tom has told Mary not to do that by herself.
6264067	eng	Tom and I wanted to get married.
6264068	eng	My plan is perfect, I think.
6264069	eng	Tom has enough money to buy what Mary wants.
6264070	eng	Tom and I want to have children.
6264071	eng	My passport has been stolen.
6264072	eng	Tom has done what Mary said he needed to do.
6264073	eng	Tom and I want to be left alone.
6264074	eng	My office is on Park Street.
6264075	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he has to do.
6264076	eng	Tom and I want to adopt a child.
6264077	eng	My new house is really nice.
6264078	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he can't eat.
6264079	eng	Tom and I want different things.
6264080	eng	My mother is also a teacher.
6264081	eng	Tom has already told Mary she can't do that.
6264082	eng	Tom and I talked the whole time.
6264083	eng	My license has been revoked.
6264084	eng	Tom has advised me not to do that with Mary.
6264085	eng	Tom and I spoke French together.
6264086	eng	My house is just over there.
6264087	eng	Tom has advised Mary not to stop doing that.
6264088	eng	Tom and I recognized each other.
6264089	eng	My house has three bedrooms.
6264090	eng	Tom has advised Mary not to do that anymore.
6264091	eng	Tom and I raised three children.
6264092	eng	My flight has been canceled.
6264093	eng	Tom expects Mary to do that again on Monday.
6264094	eng	Tom and I played tennis all day.
6264095	eng	My favorite drink is coffee.
6264096	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to ever do that again.
6264097	eng	Tom and I played miniature golf.
6264098	eng	My dorm room was very small.
6264099	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to do that by herself.
6264100	eng	Tom and I play on the same team.
6264101	eng	My dog can swim pretty well.
6264102	eng	Tom doesn't think we can trust Mary anymore.
6264103	eng	Tom and I often travel together.
6264104	eng	My children go to bed early.
6264105	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would likely do that.
6264106	eng	Tom and I often help each other.
6264107	eng	My children are still awake.
6264108	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be discouraged.
6264109	eng	Tom and I need to work together.
6264110	eng	My car was stolen last week.
6264111	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will want to do that.
6264112	eng	Tom and I looked at one another.
6264113	eng	My car is parked over there.
6264114	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will need to do that.
6264115	eng	Tom and I laughed at each other.
6264116	eng	My car has been repossessed.
6264117	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like to do that.
6264118	eng	Tom and I haven't done that yet.
6264119	eng	My blood type is O positive.
6264120	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like doing that.
6264121	eng	Tom and I have to work together.
6264122	eng	My blood type is O negative.
6264123	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will have to do that.
6264124	eng	Tom and I have the same opinion.
6264125	eng	My backpack is on the table.
6264126	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will do that to John.
6264127	eng	Tom and I had a couple of beers.
6264128	eng	My French is getting better.
6264129	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will do that for you.
6264130	eng	Tom and I got married in Boston.
6264131	eng	My French has gotten better.
6264132	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary should be doing that.
6264133	eng	Tom and I got engaged last week.
6264134	eng	Most people here can't swim.
6264135	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary knows how to do that.
6264136	eng	Tom and I got along really well.
6264137	eng	Men and boys should do that.
6264138	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can do that, does he?
6264139	eng	Tom and I got along fairly well.
6264140	eng	Maybe you'd like to do that.
6264141	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary is doing.
6264142	eng	Tom and I go to the same church.
6264143	eng	Mary is a farmer's daughter.
6264144	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary has done.
6264145	eng	Tom and I glanced at each other.
6264146	eng	Mary has too much makeup on.
6264147	eng	Tom doesn't remember asking Mary to do that.
6264148	eng	Tom and I encouraged each other.
6264149	eng	Many people like to do that.
6264150	eng	Tom doesn't need to know how Mary does that.
6264151	eng	Tom and I don't usually do that.
6264152	eng	Many people don't know that.
6264153	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary wanted to do that.
6264154	eng	Tom and I don't like each other.
6264155	eng	Make sure you don't do that.
6264156	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't like dogs.
6264157	eng	Tom and I don't fight that much.
6264158	eng	Make sure you do that today.
6264159	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary called the police.
6264160	eng	Tom and I don't do that anymore.
6264161	eng	Make sure you do that again.
6264162	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary and John broke up.
6264163	eng	Tom and I discussed the problem.
6264164	eng	Life is what you make of it.
6264165	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary wants to do that.
6264166	eng	Tom and I dated for three years.
6264167	eng	Let's go out to eat tonight.
6264168	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
6264169	eng	Tom and I danced all night long.
6264170	eng	Let's go out on the veranda.
6264171	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't like him.
6264172	eng	Tom and I aren't happy together.
6264173	eng	Let's go out on the terrace.
6264174	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary isn't very happy here.
6264175	eng	Tom and I aren't all that close.
6264176	eng	Let's buy half a watermelon.
6264177	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary can understand French.
6264178	eng	Tom and I are still watching TV.
6264179	eng	Let's buy a box of cherries.
6264180	eng	Tom doesn't expect Mary to get here on time.
6264181	eng	Tom and I are still not married.
6264182	eng	It's too hot to do that now.
6264183	eng	Tom does that so much better than Mary does.
6264184	eng	Tom and I are mad at each other.
6264185	eng	It's snowing here in Boston.
6264186	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary knew how to swim.
6264187	eng	Tom and I are going to the mall.
6264188	eng	It's raining here in Boston.
6264189	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
6264190	eng	Tom and I are going to be there.
6264191	eng	It's probably OK to do that.
6264192	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would need to do that.
6264193	eng	Tom and I are distant relatives.
6264194	eng	It's now my turn to do that.
6264195	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would like to do that.
6264196	eng	Tom and I are a little confused.
6264197	eng	It's not always easy to win.
6264198	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would like doing that.
6264199	eng	Tom always tries not to be late.
6264200	eng	It's easy for me to do that.
6264201	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would have to do that.
6264202	eng	Tom always seems to be stubborn.
6264203	eng	It's bad manners to do that.
6264204	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be here so soon.
6264205	eng	Tom always seems to be punctual.
6264206	eng	It's already taken me hours.
6264207	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be back so soon.
6264208	eng	Tom always seems to be friendly.
6264209	eng	It's almost time to do that.
6264210	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he needed her help.
6264211	eng	Tom always seems to be confused.
6264212	eng	It's a good idea to do that.
6264213	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she needed to buy.
6264214	eng	Tom always seems to be barefoot.
6264215	eng	It would be wise to do that.
6264216	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what needed to be done.
6264217	eng	Tom almost hit a telephone pole.
6264218	eng	It would be safe to do that.
6264219	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he intended to do that.
6264220	eng	Tom almost always speaks French.
6264221	eng	It would be good to do that.
6264222	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he didn't like his job.
6264223	eng	Tom admitted he doesn't do that.
6264224	eng	It would be easy to do that.
6264225	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what Mary was doing.
6264226	eng	Tom, you don't have to do that.
6264227	eng	It was good that I did that.
6264228	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what Mary should do.
6264229	eng	Tom, you don't do that, do you?
6264230	eng	It took me hours to do that.
6264231	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what Mary had to do.
6264232	eng	Tom's technique is pretty good.
6264233	eng	It takes courage to do that.
6264234	eng	Tom didn't meet Mary until late in his life.
6264235	eng	Tom's room needs to be cleaned.
6264236	eng	It should be fun doing that.
6264237	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wouldn't be there.
6264238	eng	Tom's house is just over there.
6264239	eng	Is there any ice cream left?
6264240	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's sister.
6264241	eng	Tom's guitar playing isn't bad.
6264242	eng	Is it snowing now in Boston?
6264243	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's mother.
6264244	eng	Tom's car was stolen last week.
6264245	eng	Is it raining now in Boston?
6264246	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's cousin.
6264247	eng	Tom's bad eye is his right one.
6264248	eng	I've seen people doing that.
6264249	eng	Tom didn't know that I was Mary's boyfriend.
6264250	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me his plans.
6264251	eng	I've never worked in Boston.
6264252	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't want to do that.
6264253	eng	Tom would've wanted to do that.
6264254	eng	I've never seen you do that.
6264255	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't need to do that.
6264256	eng	Tom would never try to do that.
6264257	eng	I've learned how to do that.
6264258	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't have to do that.
6264259	eng	Tom would like to teach French.
6264260	eng	I've got to stop doing that.
6264261	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to refuse to do that.
6264262	eng	Tom would like to study French.
6264263	eng	I've done that once already.
6264264	eng	Tom didn't apologize to Mary for doing that.
6264265	eng	Tom would get dizzy doing that.
6264266	eng	I've considering doing that.
6264267	eng	Tom did that the way Mary told him to do it.
6264268	eng	Tom would be bad at doing that.
6264269	eng	I'm very tempted to do that.
6264270	eng	Tom did almost the same thing that Mary did.
6264271	eng	Tom would be a fool to do that.
6264272	eng	I'm very anxious to do that.
6264273	eng	Tom could be faster at doing that than Mary.
6264274	eng	Tom won't study French anymore.
6264275	eng	I'm trying to be optimistic.
6264276	eng	Tom asked if Mary really needed to be there.
6264277	eng	Tom won't speak French anymore.
6264278	eng	I'm too young to drink beer.
6264279	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that today.
6264280	eng	Tom won't likely be suspicious.
6264281	eng	I'm too drunk to drive home.
6264282	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that again.
6264283	eng	Tom won't likely be sleepy yet.
6264284	eng	I'm the perfect man for you.
6264285	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like swimming.
6264286	eng	Tom won't likely be reasonable.
6264287	eng	I'm sure that's what I need.
6264288	eng	Tom asked Mary where she had studied French.
6264289	eng	Tom won't likely be interested.
6264290	eng	I'm sure that'll change now.
6264291	eng	Tom asked Mary where she had first met John.
6264292	eng	Tom won't likely be here today.
6264293	eng	I'm studying to be a doctor.
6264294	eng	Tom asked Mary what time she usually got up.
6264295	eng	Tom won't likely be handcuffed.
6264296	eng	I'm on my way to Boston now.
6264297	eng	Tom asked Mary what her favorite season was.
6264298	eng	Tom won't likely be frightened.
6264299	eng	I'm not very good at sports.
6264300	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach John how to do that.
6264301	eng	Tom won't likely be doing that.
6264302	eng	I'm not sure how to respond.
6264303	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to go swimming.
6264304	eng	Tom won't likely be back today.
6264305	eng	I'm not planning to do that.
6264306	eng	Tom asked Mary if she would mind doing that.
6264307	eng	Tom won't ever do that anymore.
6264308	eng	I'm not as old as you think.
6264309	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really had to do that.
6264310	eng	Tom won't do that until Monday.
6264311	eng	I'm not a very good swimmer.
6264312	eng	Tom asked Mary if she enjoyed horror movies.
6264313	eng	Tom won't be home this weekend.
6264314	eng	I'm not a good chess player.
6264315	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to play tennis together.
6264316	eng	Tom wishes he'd done that, too.
6264317	eng	I'm much better than before.
6264318	eng	Tom and Mary live across the street from me.
6264319	eng	Tom wishes he hadn't done that.
6264320	eng	I'm happy we came to Boston.
6264321	eng	Tom and Mary don't do that together anymore.
6264322	eng	Tom wished he hadn't done that.
6264323	eng	I'm happy that you did that.
6264324	eng	Tom and Mary don't always do the same thing.
6264325	eng	Tom will study French tomorrow.
6264326	eng	I'm going to go and do that.
6264327	eng	Tom and Mary are going camping this weekend.
6264328	eng	Tom will return this week, too.
6264329	eng	I'm glad you didn't do that.
6264330	eng	This morning I saw Tom and Mary in the park.
6264331	eng	Tom will probably study French.
6264332	eng	I'm glad that didn't happen.
6264333	eng	Perhaps Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
6264334	eng	Tom will probably speak French.
6264335	eng	I'm feeling a little sleepy.
6264336	eng	Perhaps Tom can borrow some money from Mary.
6264337	eng	Tom will probably get homesick.
6264338	eng	I'm feeling a little hungry.
6264339	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is supposed to do that.
6264340	eng	Tom will probably do that soon.
6264341	eng	I'm doing what I need to do.
6264342	eng	Maybe Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6264343	eng	Tom will probably be suspended.
6264344	eng	I'm doing that this morning.
6264345	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
6264346	eng	Tom will probably be surprised.
6264347	eng	I'm being as quiet as I can.
6264348	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't care if Mary did that.
6264349	eng	Tom will probably be sarcastic.
6264350	eng	I'm a very impatient person.
6264351	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks Mary has to do that.
6264352	eng	Tom will probably be objective.
6264353	eng	I'll try my best to do that.
6264354	eng	I wish Tom hadn't convinced Mary to do that.
6264355	eng	Tom will probably be depressed.
6264356	eng	I'll study French next year.
6264357	eng	I told Tom I didn't know anybody named Mary.
6264358	eng	Tom will probably be concerned.
6264359	eng	I'll probably do that today.
6264360	eng	I thought Tom would be doing that with Mary.
6264361	eng	Tom will probably be back soon.
6264362	eng	I'll do that this afternoon.
6264363	eng	I think Tom could teach Mary how to do that.
6264364	eng	Tom will probably be awake now.
6264365	eng	I'll do that if you help me.
6264366	eng	I think Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
6264367	eng	Tom will need to do that again.
6264368	eng	I'll do that again tomorrow.
6264369	eng	I think Tom could stop Mary from doing that.
6264370	eng	Tom will likely be sympathetic.
6264371	eng	I'll be doing that tomorrow.
6264372	eng	I think Tom could help Mary if he wanted to.
6264373	eng	Tom will likely be pessimistic.
6264374	eng	I'd visit Boston if I could.
6264375	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary did that.
6264376	eng	Tom will likely be discouraged.
6264377	eng	I'd rather not do that here.
6264378	eng	I should tell Tom why Mary doesn't like him.
6264379	eng	Tom will likely be cooperative.
6264380	eng	I'd rather do that tomorrow.
6264381	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary wouldn't do that.
6264382	eng	Tom will help you study French.
6264383	eng	I'd like you to do that now.
6264384	eng	I don't think Tom did what Mary said he did.
6264385	eng	Tom will have to do that again.
6264386	eng	I'd like to see you do that.
6264387	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary don't like me.
6264388	eng	Tom will go to Boston, I think.
6264389	eng	I'd like to do that for you.
6264390	eng	I didn't want Tom to go to Boston with Mary.
6264391	eng	Tom will do that the next time.
6264392	eng	I'd be reluctant to do that.
6264393	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's boyfriend.
6264394	eng	Tom will be in Boston all week.
6264395	eng	I wouldn't do that with you.
6264396	eng	Has Tom ever criticized Mary for doing that?
6264397	eng	Tom went into the cave to hide.
6264398	eng	I work at the train station.
6264399	eng	Did you know Tom used to be married to Mary?
6264400	eng	Tom went into the cave and hid.
6264401	eng	I won't do that from now on.
6264402	eng	You should get Tom to tell Mary to do that.
6264403	eng	Tom wasn't very friendly to me.
6264404	eng	I won't be doing that again.
6264405	eng	Why were Tom and Mary in Boston last month?
6264406	eng	Tom wasn't interested in music.
6264407	eng	I wish you'd leave me alone.
6264408	eng	Tom's priorities aren't the same as Mary's.
6264409	eng	Tom wasn't at school on Monday.
6264410	eng	I wish you'd do that for me.
6264411	eng	Tom wouldn't have expected Mary to do that.
6264412	eng	Tom was unemployed at the time.
6264413	eng	I wish you'd come to Boston.
6264414	eng	Tom would be reluctant to do that for Mary.
6264415	eng	Tom was treated at a burn unit.
6264416	eng	I wish I had visited Boston.
6264417	eng	Tom would be disappointed if Mary did that.
6264418	eng	Tom was careful not to do that.
6264419	eng	I wish I had studied harder.
6264420	eng	Tom wondered who Mary's French teacher was.
6264421	eng	Tom was at the end of the line.
6264422	eng	I wish I had more free time.
6264423	eng	Tom wondered where Mary learned to do that.
6264424	eng	Tom was advised not to do that.
6264425	eng	I wish I had gone to Boston.
6264426	eng	Tom wondered where Mary had studied French.
6264427	eng	Tom wants to make a difference.
6264428	eng	I wish I had come to Boston.
6264429	eng	Tom wondered what movie Mary wanted to see.
6264430	eng	Tom used to study French a lot.
6264431	eng	I wish I could visit Boston.
6264432	eng	Tom wondered what inspired Mary to do that.
6264433	eng	Tom used to go to Boston a lot.
6264434	eng	I wish I could study French.
6264435	eng	Tom won't likely be as cooperative as Mary.
6264436	eng	Tom used to be able to do that.
6264437	eng	I wish I could go to Boston.
6264438	eng	Tom will be faster at doing that than Mary.
6264439	eng	Tom turned up three hours late.
6264440	eng	I went swimming last Monday.
6264441	eng	Tom wasn't the one who helped Mary do that.
6264442	eng	Tom tried to help the old lady.
6264444	eng	Tom was the one who wanted Mary to do that.
6264445	eng	Tom told me you went to Boston.
6264446	eng	I watched a romantic comedy.
6264447	eng	Tom was happy that Mary helped him do that.
6264448	eng	Tom told me you studied French.
6264449	eng	I wasn't willing to do that.
6264450	eng	Tom was convinced that Mary had to do that.
6264451	eng	Tom told me to stop doing that.
6264452	eng	I wasn't wearing a seatbelt.
6264453	eng	Tom wanted Mary to show you how to do that.
6264454	eng	Tom told me to quit doing that.
6264455	eng	I wasn't wearing a name tag.
6264456	eng	Tom took a lot of pictures of Mary's house.
6264457	eng	Tom told me to go to bed early.
6264458	eng	I wasn't there this morning.
6264459	eng	Tom told Mary why he wanted her to do that.
6264460	eng	Tom told me that he's unbiased.
6264461	eng	I wasn't sure what to think.
6264462	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed her to do that.
6264463	eng	Tom told me that he's unafraid.
6264464	eng	I wasn't sure what happened.
6264465	eng	Tom told Mary to stop being so pessimistic.
6264466	eng	Tom told me that he's ticklish.
6264467	eng	I wasn't kidding about that.
6264468	eng	Tom told Mary to be there tomorrow at 2:30.
6264469	eng	Tom told me that he's prepared.
6264470	eng	I wasn't in class yesterday.
6264471	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be able to do that.
6264472	eng	Tom told me he knew my brother.
6264473	eng	I wasn't having a good time.
6264474	eng	Tom told Mary that he was ready to do that.
6264475	eng	Tom told me I should wait here.
6264476	eng	I wasn't expecting any help.
6264477	eng	Tom told Mary that he told John to do that.
6264478	eng	Tom told me I couldn't do that.
6264479	eng	I wasn't able to stay awake.
6264480	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was cute.
6264481	eng	Tom thought you should do that.
6264482	eng	I wasn't able to get a visa.
6264483	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was sad.
6264484	eng	Tom thinks that we can do that.
6264485	eng	I wasn't able to find a job.
6264486	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was out.
6264487	eng	Tom teaches French once a week.
6264488	eng	I was told to do that again.
6264489	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was mad.
6264490	eng	Tom still studies French a lot.
6264491	eng	I was in no mood to do that.
6264492	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was fat.
6264493	eng	Tom still doesn't speak French.
6264494	eng	I was determined to do that.
6264495	eng	Tom told Mary that he couldn't eat peanuts.
6264496	eng	Tom spent the whole day hiking.
6264497	eng	I was alone in the elevator.
6264498	eng	Tom told Mary only what she needed to know.
6264499	eng	Tom spent some time doing that.
6264500	eng	I wanted to go to the beach.
6264501	eng	Tom told Mary it was OK for her to do that.
6264502	eng	Tom sounded like he had a cold.
6264503	eng	I wanted to go to Australia.
6264504	eng	Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
6264505	eng	Tom sold used cars for a while.
6264507	eng	Tom thought Mary would be more cooperative.
6264508	eng	Tom showed me a way to do that.
6264509	eng	I want to work in a factory.
6264510	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't nervous doing that.
6264511	eng	Tom should've done that sooner.
6264512	eng	I want to visit Boston, too.
6264513	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't drunk, but she was.
6264514	eng	Tom should've done that by now.
6264515	eng	I want to talk to you again.
6264516	eng	Tom thought Mary wanted to quit doing that.
6264517	eng	Tom should've done much better.
6264518	eng	I want to study French, too.
6264519	eng	Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't do that.
6264520	eng	Tom should've bought more food.
6264521	eng	I want to stay here tonight.
6264522	eng	Tom thought Mary might not want to do that.
6264523	eng	Tom should've been sympathetic.
6264524	eng	I want to sit by the window.
6264525	eng	Tom thought Mary looked nervous doing that.
6264526	eng	Tom should've been cooperative.
6264527	eng	I want to meet your parents.
6264528	eng	Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
6264529	eng	Tom should've been able to win.
6264530	eng	I want to go to grad school.
6264531	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be tempted to do that.
6264532	eng	Tom should really study French.
6264533	eng	I want to go to Boston, too.
6264534	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be nervous doing that.
6264535	eng	Tom should never do that again.
6264536	eng	I want to go out for a walk.
6264537	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary has to do.
6264538	eng	Tom should consider doing that.
6264539	eng	I want to get out of prison.
6264540	eng	Tom started crying when Mary left the room.
6264541	eng	Tom should come back to Boston.
6264542	eng	I want to get married again.
6264543	eng	Tom spent his thirtieth birthday with Mary.
6264544	eng	Tom should be here after lunch.
6264545	eng	I want to dye my hair black.
6264546	eng	Tom spends a lot of time talking with Mary.
6264547	eng	Tom set traps to catch rabbits.
6264548	eng	I want to do that very much.
6264549	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary he'd never do that.
6264550	eng	Tom seldom, if ever, does that.
6264551	eng	I want to do that by myself.
6264552	eng	Tom should've bought some flowers for Mary.
6264553	eng	Tom seems unwilling to do that.
6264554	eng	I want to cross this bridge.
6264555	eng	Tom should've asked Mary to stay in Boston.
6264556	eng	Tom seems to know who did that.
6264557	eng	I want to borrow some money.
6264558	eng	Tom should've asked Mary to come to Boston.
6264559	eng	Tom seems to be very miserable.
6264560	eng	I want to be like my father.
6264561	eng	Tom should try to get Mary to do that, too.
6264562	eng	Tom seems to be feeling lonely.
6264563	eng	I want to be a veterinarian.
6264564	eng	Tom should tell Mary why he had to do that.
6264565	eng	Tom seems to be afraid of dogs.
6264566	eng	I want to be a fire fighter.
6264567	eng	Tom should tell Mary what she needs to buy.
6264568	eng	Tom seemed to enjoy doing that.
6264569	eng	I usually eat dinner at six.
6264570	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to drive too fast.
6264571	eng	Tom says things are going well.
6264572	eng	I thought you would be late.
6264573	eng	Tom should tell Mary he'll never leave her.
6264574	eng	Tom says that he won't do that.
6264575	eng	I thought you weren't awake.
6264576	eng	Tom should tell Mary he intends to do that.
6264577	eng	Tom says that he can swim well.
6264578	eng	I thought you might do that.
6264579	eng	Tom should do that the way Mary showed him.
6264580	eng	Tom says he's good at swimming.
6264581	eng	I thought this would happen.
6264582	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary did that.
6264583	eng	Tom says he's good at juggling.
6264584	eng	I thought it would be worse.
6264585	eng	Tom says he'll ask Mary to do that for him.
6264586	eng	Tom says he's good at baseball.
6264587	eng	I think I already know that.
6264588	eng	Tom says he understands why Mary is scared.
6264589	eng	Tom says he's eager to do that.
6264590	eng	I study French all the time.
6264591	eng	Tom says he thought Mary was a good friend.
6264592	eng	Tom says he'll quit doing that.
6264593	eng	I still have thirty dollars.
6264594	eng	Tom says he saw Mary when he was in Boston.
6264595	eng	Tom says he'll need to do that.
6264596	eng	I shouldn't have to do that.
6264597	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't buy a scooter.
6264598	eng	Tom says he'll keep doing that.
6264599	eng	I shouldn't have left early.
6264600	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary did that.
6264601	eng	Tom says he'll have to do that.
6264602	eng	I shouldn't have been there.
6264603	eng	Tom says he doesn't expect Mary to do that.
6264604	eng	Tom says he'll do that for you.
6264605	eng	I shouldn't do that anymore.
6264606	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would do that.
6264607	eng	Tom says he would've paid more.
6264608	eng	I should've locked the door.
6264609	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary could do that.
6264610	eng	Tom says he won't speak French.
6264611	eng	I should've been suspicious.
6264612	eng	Tom says Mary is thinking about doing that.
6264613	eng	Tom says he intends to do that.
6264614	eng	I should make a reservation.
6264615	eng	Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
6264616	eng	Tom says he followed the rules.
6264617	eng	I should do that right away.
6264618	eng	Tom says Mary has forgotten how to do that.
6264619	eng	Tom says he feels the same way.
6264620	eng	I should do that more often.
6264621	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't feel like doing that.
6264622	eng	Tom says he can't speak French.
6264623	eng	I should definitely do that.
6264624	eng	Tom says Mary didn't seem to be interested.
6264625	eng	Tom says he believes in ghosts.
6264627	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary wanted to do.
6264628	eng	Tom saw a ship in the distance.
6264629	eng	I remember having done that.
6264630	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary needed to do.
6264631	eng	Tom said you're not happy here.
6264632	eng	I only do what I want to do.
6264633	eng	Tom said that he couldn't wait to see Mary.
6264634	eng	Tom said you'd do that for him.
6264635	eng	I need your help to do that.
6264636	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't going to do that.
6264637	eng	Tom said you should be careful.
6264638	eng	I need to pay my rent today.

6264643	eng	Tom said the audience was huge.
6264644	eng	I need to improve my grades.

6264646	eng	Tom said that it'd happen soon.
6264647	eng	I need to get more exercise.
6264648	eng	Tom said he'd never permit Mary to do that.
6264649	eng	Tom said that he won't do that.

6264652	eng	Tom said that he wasn't sleepy.
6264653	eng	I need to do that by myself.

6264664	eng	Tom said it's a common problem.
6264665	eng	I might go home early today.

6264674	eng	I looked down at the ground.

6264676	eng	Tom said he's done that before.

6264681	eng	Tom said he thought Mary enjoyed the party.
6264682	eng	Tom said he's always done that.
6264683	eng	I live in a gated community.
6264684	eng	Tom said he saw Mary in the park yesterday.
6264685	eng	Tom said he'll quit doing that.
6264686	eng	I know you'll never do that.
6264687	eng	Tom said he remembered seeing Mary do that.
6264688	eng	Tom said he'll help us do that.
6264689	eng	I know why you're terrified.
6264690	eng	Tom said he knew why Mary couldn't do that.
6264691	eng	Tom said he'll do that for you.
6264692	eng	I know why you're surprised.
6264693	eng	Tom said he knew who Mary's ex-husband was.
6264694	eng	Tom said he'd unlikely do that.

6264705	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
6264706	eng	Tom said he'd do that if I did.
6264707	eng	I know that you're bluffing.
6264708	eng	Tom said almost the same thing as Mary did.
6264709	eng	Tom said he'd do that for sure.
6264710	eng	I know that I'm replaceable.

6264713	eng	I know something about this.

6264821	eng	I have to do that on Monday.
6264822	eng	Tom said Mary is going to do that tomorrow.
6264823	eng	Tom refused to help us do that.

6264828	eng	Tom said Mary is amused by what's going on.
6264829	eng	Tom really was my first choice.
6264830	eng	I have three adult children.
6264831	eng	Tom said Mary has never met John's parents.
6264832	eng	Tom really should study French.
6264833	eng	I have no reason to do that.
6264834	eng	Tom said Mary has never eaten Mexican food.
6264835	eng	Tom really should speak French.

6264843	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to do that this week.

6264848	eng	I got to Boston before dark.
6264849	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound very optimistic.

6264851	eng	I go to Boston once a month.
6264852	eng	Tom said Mary didn't need to do that today.
6264853	eng	Tom probably shouldn't do that.

6264859	eng	Tom plans to buy another car.

6264861	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to do that again.
6264862	eng	Tom owned a bar on Park Street.
6264863	eng	I figured this would happen.
6264864	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to read.

6264868	eng	Tom only needed thirty dollars.
6264869	eng	I feel compelled to do that.

6264871	eng	Tom only does that on weekends.
6264872	eng	I don't want to take a taxi.
6264873	eng	Tom refused to do what Mary told him to do.
6264874	eng	Tom often gets home about 2:30.
6264875	eng	I don't want to leave early.

6264882	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary lives.
6264883	eng	Tom never does that by himself.

6264893	eng	I don't want that right now.
6264894	eng	Tom needs to make sure that Mary does that.
6264895	eng	Tom needed to be ready by 2:30.
6264896	eng	I don't want anyone to know.
6264897	eng	Tom must've thought Mary wanted to do that.
6264898	eng	Tom must be tempted to do that.
6264899	eng	I don't usually lock my car.
6264900	eng	Tom must've thought Mary needed to do that.
6264901	eng	Tom might not do that tomorrow.
6264902	eng	I don't usually eat dessert.
6264903	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said he loved her.
6264904	eng	Tom might need to speak French.
6264905	eng	I don't think it's my fault.
6264906	eng	Tom let Mary know that he couldn't do that.

6264916	eng	Tom may have anything he wants.
6264917	eng	I don't really speak French.
6264918	eng	Tom isn't likely to permit Mary to do that.
6264919	eng	Tom may go to Boston next week.
6264920	eng	I don't really like to swim.
6264921	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary to do that for him.
6264922	eng	Tom may do that if he wants to.
6264923	eng	I don't really believe that.
6264924	eng	Tom is still reluctant to do that for Mary.

6265387	eng	Tom smiled when Mary walked into the room.
6265388	eng	Tom felt himself being carried.
6265389	eng	You're a very good drummer.
6265390	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary about what he did.
6265391	eng	Tom fell overboard and drowned.
6265392	eng	You're a very creative guy.
6265393	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that without Mary.
6265394	eng	Tom enjoys reading comic books.
6265395	eng	You're a really good coach.
6265396	eng	Tom should've asked Mary why she did that.
6265397	eng	Tom eats oatmeal for breakfast.
6265398	eng	You're a really bad driver.
6265399	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants to eat.
6265400	eng	Tom drew me a map to his house.
6265401	eng	You're a pretty stupid guy.
6265402	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants to buy.
6265403	eng	Tom doesn't want to be jealous.
6265404	eng	You're a good photographer.
6265405	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he needs to buy.
6265406	eng	Tom doesn't want me to do that.
6265407	eng	You're a good chess player.
6265408	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to do that again.
6265409	eng	Tom doesn't think I'll do that.
6265410	eng	You're a good banjo player.
6265411	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to be frightened.
6265412	eng	Tom doesn't study French a lot.
6265413	eng	You'll do that, too, right?
6265414	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's sleepy.
6265415	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be unhappy.
6265416	eng	You'd love skiing, I think.
6265417	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's hungry.
6265418	eng	Tom doesn't often study French.
6265419	eng	You'd better do that today.
6265420	eng	Tom seemed to know what Mary wanted to do.
6265421	eng	Tom doesn't often speak French.
6265422	eng	You'd better do that again.
6265423	eng	Tom seemed to know what Mary needed to do.
6265424	eng	Tom doesn't need to do a thing.
6265425	eng	You work nights, don't you?
6265426	eng	Tom says he's willing to do that for Mary.
6265427	eng	Tom doesn't like to talk a lot.
6265428	eng	You work nearby, don't you?
6265429	eng	Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French.
6265430	eng	Tom doesn't like to be outside.
6265431	eng	You want to win, don't you?
6265432	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary refuses to do that.
6265433	eng	Tom doesn't like being lied to.
6265434	eng	You volunteered to do this.
6265435	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who to avoid.
6265436	eng	Tom doesn't know much about it.
6265437	eng	You usually do that for us.
6265438	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who did that.
6265439	eng	Tom doesn't get paid much to do that.
6265440	eng	You took notes, didn't you?
6265441	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary did that.
6265442	eng	Tom doesn't even know who I am.
6265443	eng	You told us not to do that.
6265444	eng	Tom says Mary has never been to his house.
6265445	eng	Tom doesn't do that very often.
6265446	eng	You shouldn't buy that car.
6265447	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John did that.
6265448	eng	Tom doesn't do that on Mondays.
6265449	eng	You should help me do that.
6265450	eng	Tom says Mary didn't come home last night.
6265451	eng	Tom doesn't care who does that.
6265452	eng	You should drink something.
6265453	eng	Tom sat next to Mary with his arm around her.
6265454	eng	Tom doesn't believe I did that.
6265455	eng	You seemed to be exhausted.
6265456	eng	Tom said the accident wasn't Mary's fault.
6265457	eng	Tom does what he's asked to do.
6265458	eng	You seemed to be depressed.
6265459	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary wants to do.
6265460	eng	Tom does want to go to college.
6265461	eng	You seem a bit disoriented.
6265462	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary needs to do.
6265463	eng	Tom does that when he's sleepy.
6265464	eng	You rarely do that anymore.
6265465	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't do that again.
6265466	eng	Tom does that when he's hungry.
6265467	eng	You promised you'd do that.
6265468	eng	Tom said that Mary would do that tomorrow.
6265469	eng	Tom does that for us every day.
6265470	eng	You play tennis, don't you?
6265471	eng	Tom said that Mary won't do that tomorrow.
6265472	eng	Tom does do that, but not well.
6265473	eng	You play hockey, don't you?
6265474	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't working anymore.
6265475	eng	Tom died at his home on Monday.
6265476	eng	You ought to do that today.
6265477	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't married anymore.
6265478	eng	Tom didn't want to work for us.
6265479	eng	You must not do that again.
6265480	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to talk to John.
6265481	eng	Tom didn't want to take a taxi.
6265482	eng	You may borrow my umbrella.
6265483	eng	Tom said that Mary should be more careful.
6265484	eng	Tom didn't want to go swimming.
6265485	eng	You look worse than before.
6265486	eng	Tom said that Mary has to be more careful.
6265487	eng	Tom didn't want me to help him.
6265488	eng	You look very disappointed.
6265489	eng	Tom said that Mary has been sick all week.
6265490	eng	Tom didn't take the medication.
6265491	eng	You look lost and confused.
6265492	eng	Tom said that Mary had been very careless.
6265493	eng	Tom didn't study French either.
6265494	eng	You look like you're happy.
6265495	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't want to do that.
6265496	eng	Tom didn't speak French either.
6265497	eng	You look like you're bored.
6265498	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be busy.
6265499	eng	Tom didn't seem to have a cold.
6265500	eng	You look a little confused.
6265501	eng	Tom said he's willing to do that for Mary.
6265502	eng	Tom didn't say why he did that.
6265503	eng	You look a bit embarrassed.
6265504	eng	Tom said he'll do that for Mary this time.
6265505	eng	Tom didn't remember to do that.
6265506	eng	You live nearby, don't you?
6265507	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary to do that for you.
6265508	eng	Tom didn't remember doing that.
6265509	eng	You like sports, don't you?
6265510	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary to do that for him.
6265511	eng	Tom didn't really seem shocked.
6265512	eng	You like soccer, don't you?
6265513	eng	Tom said he wished Mary would never leave.
6265514	eng	Tom didn't hesitate to do that.
6265515	eng	You like reggae, don't you?
6265516	eng	Tom said he was hoping he could help Mary.
6265517	eng	Tom didn't have what he needed.
6265518	eng	You like horses, don't you?
6265519	eng	Tom said he was going to do that for Mary.
6265520	eng	Tom didn't have a dog for long.
6265521	eng	You like hockey, don't you?
6265522	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't do that.
6265523	eng	Tom didn't get paid to do that.
6265524	eng	You like comics, don't you?
6265525	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
6265526	eng	Tom didn't finish his homework.
6265527	eng	You like coffee, don't you?
6265528	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't in Boston.
6265529	eng	Tom didn't even try to do that.
6265530	eng	You like cheese, don't you?
6265531	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't at school.
6265532	eng	Tom didn't do that fast enough.
6265533	eng	You inspired us to do that.
6265534	eng	Tom said he thought Mary enjoyed swimming.
6265535	eng	Tom did what we told him to do.
6265536	eng	You hate school, don't you?
6265537	eng	Tom said he sold his car to Mary for $300.
6265538	eng	Tom did what he intended to do.
6265539	eng	You drank beer, didn't you?
6265540	eng	Tom said he sees Mary at school every day.
6265541	eng	Tom did what I asked him to do.
6265542	eng	You don't smile very often.
6265543	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary should do that.
6265544	eng	Tom did that whenever he could.
6265545	eng	You don't have to eat that.
6265546	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary had to do that.
6265547	eng	Tom did that until it got dark.
6265548	eng	You do that extremely well.
6265549	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't be afraid.
6265550	eng	Tom did that in methodical way.
6265551	eng	You did that the wrong way.
6265552	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would do that soon.
6265553	eng	Tom did that a number of times.
6265554	eng	You biked home, didn't you?
6265555	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary works.
6265556	eng	Tom did that a couple of times.
6265557	eng	Would you all please leave?
6265558	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary did that.
6265559	eng	Tom decided to do that instead.
6265560	eng	Won't you do that tomorrow?
6265561	eng	Tom said he didn't expect Mary to do that.
6265562	eng	Tom decided against doing that.
6265563	eng	Why won't you come with me?
6265564	eng	Tom said he assumed Mary wouldn't do that.
6265565	eng	Tom couldn't do that, could he?
6265566	eng	Why should we study French?
6265567	eng	Tom said Mary would very unlikely do that.
6265568	eng	Tom couldn't afford to do that.
6265569	eng	Why should we go to Boston?
6265570	eng	Tom said Mary would probably be back soon.
6265571	eng	Tom could've been more careful.
6265572	eng	Why is it wrong to do that?
6265573	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't reluctant to do that.
6265574	eng	Tom could still be unconvinced.
6265575	eng	Why don't you just do that?
6265576	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't motivated to do that.
6265577	eng	Tom could quit if he wanted to.
6265578	eng	Why don't you go to school?
6265579	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't annoyed by the noise.
6265580	eng	Tom could force you to do that.
6265581	eng	Why don't you do that more?
6265582	eng	Tom said Mary was trying to be optimistic.
6265583	eng	Tom could easily have said yes.
6265584	eng	Why do you like doing that?
6265585	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be weak.
6265586	eng	Tom could be stubborn at times.
6265587	eng	Why did you try to do that?
6265588	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be lost.
6265589	eng	Tom could be afraid to do that.
6265590	eng	Why can't you go to Boston?
6265591	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be here.
6265592	eng	Tom complained about the smell.
6265593	eng	Why are we studying French?
6265594	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be cold.
6265595	eng	Tom can't teach French anymore.
6265596	eng	Whose sunglasses are these?
6265597	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be unemployed.
6265598	eng	Tom can't speak French, either.
6265599	eng	Who's the one who did that?
6265600	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be suspicious.
6265601	eng	Tom can't go to Boston, either.
6265602	eng	Who's supposed to be there?
6265603	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be supportive.
6265604	eng	Tom can't go to Boston with me.
6265605	eng	Who's living in Boston now?
6265606	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be reasonable.
6265607	eng	Tom can speak French, can't he?
6265608	eng	Who's in the classroom now?
6265609	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be interested.
6265610	eng	Tom can have anything he wants.
6265611	eng	Who were you swimming with?
6265612	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be frustrated.
6265613	eng	Tom can do that if he wants to.
6265614	eng	Who was in Boston with you?
6265615	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be frightened.
6265616	vie	Có vẻ như cô ấy ghét cậu.
6265617	vie	Bây giờ là mấy giờ?
6265619	eng	Tom can do that extremely well.
6265620	eng	Who picked all the peaches?
6265621	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be displeased.
6265622	eng	Tom can do that again tomorrow.
6265623	eng	Who else did that with you?
6265624	eng	Tom said Mary was happy that you did that.
6265625	eng	Tom came up with a good excuse.
6265626	eng	Who did you hear that from?
6265627	eng	Tom said Mary was good at speaking French.
6265628	eng	Tom came to visit us yesterday.
6265629	eng	Who are you thinking about?
6265630	eng	Tom said Mary was going to take that risk.
6265631	eng	Tom came out of the room first.
6265632	eng	Which train will you be on?
6265633	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that for us.
6265634	eng	Tom bought that car for $3,000.
6265635	eng	Which of the boys did that?
6265636	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that for me.
6265637	eng	Tom bought a lot near the lake.
6265638	eng	Where's my striped sweater?
6265639	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that anyway.
6265640	eng	Tom became a professor in 2013.
6265641	eng	Where will you be tomorrow?
6265642	eng	Tom said Mary was glad he got there early.
6265643	eng	Tom barely had time to do that.
6265644	eng	Where were you last spring?
6265645	eng	Tom said Mary was excused from doing that.
6265646	eng	Tom asked me to sweep the room.
6265647	eng	Where did you study French?
6265648	eng	Tom said Mary was asleep when he got home.
6265649	eng	Tom asked me to close the door.
6265650	eng	When will you take a break?
6265651	eng	Tom said Mary was almost ready to do that.
6265652	eng	Tom asked me several questions.
6265653	eng	When did the concert start?
6265654	eng	Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
6265655	eng	Tom asked me if I had a sister.
6265656	eng	What's your favorite month?
6265657	eng	Tom said Mary should've gone home earlier.
6265658	eng	Tom asked if he had to do that.
6265659	eng	What's Boston's population?
6265660	eng	Tom said Mary ought to do that by herself.
6265661	eng	Tom arrived earlier than I did.
6265662	eng	What will you leave behind?
6265663	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still terrified.
6265664	eng	Tom apologized to the audience.
6265665	eng	What time will you do that?
6265666	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still skeptical.
6265667	eng	Tom and I've talked about that.
6265668	eng	What didn't you understand?
6265669	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still sarcastic.
6265670	eng	Tom and I yelled at each other.
6265671	eng	What did you eat yesterday?
6265672	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still irritated.
6265673	eng	Tom and I were laughing at you.
6265674	eng	What color is your new coat?
6265675	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still in Boston.
6265676	eng	Tom and I went hiking together.
6265677	eng	What color car did you buy?
6265678	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still depressed.
6265679	eng	Tom and I want to study French.
6265680	eng	We've had a very good year.
6265681	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still concerned.
6265682	eng	Tom and I want to speak to you.
6265683	eng	We've been told to do that.
6265684	eng	Tom said Mary is interested in doing that.
6265685	eng	Tom and I want to learn French.
6265686	eng	We've all done that before.
6265687	eng	Tom said Mary is going to help us do that.
6265688	eng	Tom and I walked home together.
6265689	eng	We were in Boston together.
6265690	eng	Tom said Mary is going to do that herself.
6265691	eng	Tom and I tied for third place.
6265692	eng	We visited Boston together.
6265693	eng	Tom said Mary hasn't been very supportive.
6265694	eng	Tom and I talked all afternoon.
6265695	eng	We succeeded in doing that.
6265696	eng	Tom said Mary has never been to his house.
6265697	eng	Tom and I talked about the war.
6265698	eng	We regret coming to Boston.
6265699	eng	Tom said Mary has been waiting since 2:30.
6265700	eng	Tom and I stood close together.
6265701	eng	We really did go to Boston.
6265702	eng	Tom said Mary has been robbed three times.
6265703	eng	Tom and I still live in Boston.
6265704	eng	We need to do that by 2:30.
6265705	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't want to do that now.
6265706	eng	Tom and I stared at each other.
6265707	eng	We left the house together.
6265708	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound very surprised.
6265709	eng	Tom and I smiled at each other.
6265710	eng	We have to find a solution.
6265711	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound very confident.
6265712	eng	Tom and I seldom work together.
6265713	eng	We have a meeting tomorrow.
6265714	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to eat.
6265715	eng	Tom and I sang a duet together.
6265716	eng	We go to Boston every year.
6265717	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have a place to stay.
6265718	eng	Tom and I reached an agreement.
6265719	eng	We didn't have enough time.
6265720	eng	Tom said Mary apologized for what she did.
6265721	eng	Tom and I often play billiards.
6265722	eng	We can't understand French.
6265723	eng	Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary to do that.
6265724	eng	Tom and I nodded to each other.
6265725	eng	We came to Boston together.
6265726	eng	Tom promised Mary that he'd quit drinking.
6265727	eng	Tom and I met three months ago.
6265728	eng	We all have studied French.
6265729	eng	Tom probably doesn't want Mary to do that.
6265730	eng	Tom and I looked at each other.
6265732	eng	Tom pretended not to hear Mary's question.
6265733	eng	Tom and I like the same things.
6265734	eng	Those aren't my sunglasses.
6265735	eng	Tom passed away in the same year Mary did.
6265736	eng	Tom and I know each other well.
6265737	eng	This report has many typos.
6265738	eng	Tom noticed that Mary had a new hairstyle.
6265739	eng	Tom and I have three daughters.
6265740	eng	They haven't done that yet.
6265741	eng	Tom needs to be ready when Mary gets here.
6265742	eng	Tom and I got matching tattoos.
6265743	eng	They aren't doing that yet.
6265744	eng	Tom must've thought Mary couldn't do that.
6265745	eng	Tom and I got into an argument.
6265746	eng	There's nowhere else to go.
6265747	eng	Tom knows Mary wasn't supposed to do that.
6265748	eng	Tom and I got divorced in 2013.
6265749	eng	There's no way I'd do that.
6265750	eng	Tom knew that Mary didn't want to be here.
6265751	eng	Tom and I glared at each other.
6265752	eng	The time to do that is now.
6265753	eng	Tom knew that Mary didn't need to do that.
6265754	eng	Tom and I depend on each other.
6265755	eng	The noise didn't bother me.
6265756	eng	Tom knew that Mary didn't like doing that.
6265757	eng	Tom and I bought matching caps.
6265758	eng	That'll be very easy to do.
6265759	eng	Tom knew that Mary didn't have to do that.
6265760	eng	Tom and I became close friends.
6265761	eng	Should I do that right now?
6265762	eng	Tom isn't going to permit Mary to do that.
6265763	eng	Tom and I are still doing that.
6265764	eng	Please do that if you like.
6265765	eng	Tom is willing to do that, but Mary isn't.
6265766	eng	Tom and I are proud of our son.
6265767	eng	Please do that by tomorrow.
6265768	eng	Tom is trying to convince Mary to do that.
6265769	eng	Tom and I are on the same team.
6265770	eng	Please buy some tangerines.
6265771	eng	Tom is the only person Mary ever talks to.
6265772	eng	Tom and I are on our honeymoon.
6265773	eng	Our strategy isn't working.
6265774	eng	Tom is allowed to do that, but Mary isn't.
6265775	eng	Tom and I are now eating lunch.
6265776	eng	Our situation isn't unique.
6265777	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that anymore.
6265778	eng	Tom and I are going to be fine.
6265779	eng	Only the teachers did that.
6265780	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she needs to do.
6265781	eng	Tom and I are college students.
6265782	eng	One of us needs to do that.
6265783	eng	Tom helped Mary decide which dress to buy.
6265784	eng	Tom and I agreed on everything.
6265785	eng	October 20th was a hot day.
6265786	eng	Tom hasn't slept well since Mary left him.
6265787	eng	Tom and I agree on many things.
6265788	eng	Now is the time to do that.
6265789	eng	Tom hasn't done that as often as Mary has.
6265790	eng	Tom always speaks French to me.
6265791	eng	My wife left me in October.
6265792	eng	Tom has told Mary that she has to do that.
6265793	eng	Tom always seems to be serious.
6265794	eng	My vacation ends on Monday.
6265795	eng	Tom has done what Mary expected him to do.
6265796	eng	Tom always seems to be relaxed.
6265797	eng	My situation was different.
6265798	eng	Tom has borrowed a lot of money from Mary.
6265799	eng	Tom always seems to be nervous.
6265800	eng	My sister has many friends.
6265801	eng	Tom has apologized to Mary for doing that.
6265802	eng	Tom always seems to be healthy.
6265803	eng	My right arm is in a sling.
6265804	eng	Tom has advised Mary not to do that again.
6265805	eng	Tom always seems to be excited.
6265806	eng	My priorities have changed.
6265807	eng	Tom grabbed the letter out of Mary's hand.
6265808	eng	Tom always seems to be annoyed.
6265809	eng	My prediction was accurate.
6265810	eng	Tom gave Mary all the money he had on him.
6265811	eng	Tom always has a good appetite.
6265812	eng	My place is easy to get to.
6265813	eng	Tom forgave Mary for breaking her promise.
6265814	eng	Tom also plans to study French.
6265815	eng	My mother didn't like dogs.
6265816	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary would do that.
6265817	eng	Tom agreed not to speak French.
6265818	eng	My last day will be Monday.
6265819	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was in Boston.
6265820	eng	Tom admitted he was very tired.
6265821	eng	My house is well insulated.
6265822	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is having fun.
6265823	eng	Tom admitted he didn't do that.
6265824	eng	My house is on Park Street.
6265825	eng	Tom doesn't think that John is Mary's son.
6265826	eng	Tom's trial started on Monday.
6265827	eng	My hair is getting thinner.
6265828	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be impressed.
6265829	eng	Tom's singing voice isn't bad.
6265830	eng	My grandmother was a nurse.
6265831	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be suspicious.
6265832	eng	Tom's house is on Park Street.
6265833	eng	My grades haven't improved.
6265834	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be reasonable.
6265835	eng	Tom's first wife was Canadian.
6265836	eng	My favorite city is Boston.
6265837	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be interested.
6265838	eng	Tom's bad ear is his left one.
6265839	eng	My family is now in Boston.
6265840	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be frightened.
6265841	eng	Tom wouldn't do that that way.
6265842	eng	My computer keeps crashing.
6265843	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be doing that.
6265844	eng	Tom wouldn't buy that for you.
6265845	eng	My car's parked over there.
6265846	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary could ever do that.
6265847	eng	Tom would never contradict me.
6265848	eng	My car is stuck in the mud.
6265849	eng	Tom doesn't really expect Mary to do that.
6265850	eng	Tom would do that if he could.
6265851	eng	My car is older than yours.
6265852	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary let you do that.
6265853	eng	Tom would do that differently.
6265854	eng	My bicycle has been stolen.
6265855	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary kept doing that.
6265856	eng	Tom would be quiet doing that.
6265857	eng	My apartment's a real mess.
6265858	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary is ignoring him.
6265859	eng	Tom would be happy doing that.
6265860	eng	Monday will be a windy day.
6265861	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary should do that.
6265862	eng	Tom works at a hardware store.
6265863	eng	Monday will be a rainy day.
6265864	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary isn't Canadian.
6265865	eng	Tom won't likely visit Boston.
6265866	eng	Maybe I'd enjoy doing that.
6265867	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary has to do that.
6265868	eng	Tom won't likely go to Boston.
6265869	eng	Many people like chocolate.
6265870	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary didn't do that.
6265871	eng	Tom won't likely be suspended.
6265872	eng	Let's go to Boston instead.
6265873	eng	Tom doesn't doubt that Mary has done that.
6265874	eng	Tom won't likely be surprised.
6265875	eng	Let's do that together, OK?
6265876	eng	Tom doesn't care if Mary does that or not.
6265877	eng	Tom won't likely be skeptical.
6265878	eng	Let's do that this evening.
6265879	eng	Tom died less than a week after Mary died.
6265880	eng	Tom won't likely be objective.
6265881	eng	Just make sure you do that.
6265882	eng	Tom didn't want to know why Mary did that.
6265883	eng	Tom won't likely be impressed.
6265884	eng	It's snowing now in Boston.
6265885	eng	Tom didn't want the present Mary gave him.
6265886	eng	Tom won't likely be back soon.
6265887	eng	It's raining now in Boston.
6265888	eng	Tom didn't think that would frighten Mary.
6265889	eng	Tom won't likely be awake yet.
6265890	eng	It's easy to get to Boston.
6265891	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was having fun.
6265892	eng	Tom won't likely be awake now.
6265893	eng	It's almost time for lunch.
6265894	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was a Canadian.
6265895	eng	Tom won't like our doing that.
6265896	eng	It's a method worth trying.
6265897	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be suspicious.
6265898	eng	Tom won't do that if it rains.
6265899	eng	It's a bad idea to do that.
6265900	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be reasonable.
6265901	eng	Tom won't be doing that again.
6265902	eng	It's your duty to do that.
6265903	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be interested.
6265904	eng	Tom will probably be unbiased.
6265905	eng	It'll be tiring to do that.
6265906	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be here today.
6265907	eng	Tom will probably be unafraid.
6265908	eng	It would be fun to do that.
6265909	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be doing that.
6265910	eng	Tom will probably be truthful.
6265911	eng	It wasn't easy to get here.
6265912	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he wants to eat.
6265913	eng	Tom will probably be punished.
6265914	eng	It was too cold to do that.
6265915	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he wants to buy.
6265916	eng	Tom will probably be punctual.
6265917	eng	It should be OK to do that.
6265918	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he wanted to do.
6265919	eng	Tom will probably be obedient.
6265920	eng	It gets cold at night here.
6265921	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to do.
6265922	eng	Tom will probably be confused.
6265923	eng	Is it safe to do that here?
6265924	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he couldn't eat.
6265925	eng	Tom will probably be arrested.
6265926	eng	Is it all right to do that?
6265927	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he wanted to do that.
6265928	eng	Tom will likely be suspicious.
6265929	eng	Is it OK if I speak French?
6265930	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary didn't like John.
6265931	eng	Tom will likely be reasonable.
6265932	eng	I've never used a chainsaw.
6265933	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary went to school.
6265934	eng	Tom will likely be interested.
6265935	eng	I've just bought a new car.
6265936	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary parked the car.
6265937	eng	Tom will likely be handcuffed.
6265938	eng	I've done that once before.
6265939	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's wife.
6265940	eng	Tom will likely be frustrated.
6265941	eng	I've considered doing that.
6265942	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's aunt.
6265943	eng	Tom will likely be frightened.
6265944	eng	I've been told not do that.
6265945	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary used to do that.
6265946	eng	Tom will do that, but I won't.
6265947	eng	I've been asked to do that.
6265948	eng	Tom didn't know that I was Mary's husband.
6265949	eng	Tom will be out all afternoon.
6265950	eng	I'm not too old to do that.
6265951	eng	Tom didn't know that I was Mary's brother.
6265952	eng	Tom will be impressed by that.
6265953	eng	I'm not old enough to vote.
6265954	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was going to do that.
6265955	eng	Tom will be happy he did that.
6265956	eng	I'm not good at doing that.
6265957	eng	Tom didn't know Mary spoke French so well.
6265958	eng	Tom went to Boston to do that.
6265959	eng	I'm not good at basketball.
6265960	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to want to do that.
6265961	eng	Tom wasn't able to stay awake.
6265962	eng	I'm not doing that anymore.
6265963	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to stay.
6265964	eng	Tom was wearing a gray hoodie.
6265965	eng	I'm glad we went to Boston.
6265966	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to sing.
6265967	eng	Tom was told never to do that.
6265968	eng	I'm glad we visited Boston.
6265969	eng	Tom did all he could to help Mary do that.
6265970	eng	Tom was severely injured, too.
6265971	eng	I'm drinking hot chocolate.
6265972	eng	Tom cried as he read the letter from Mary.
6265973	eng	Tom was never late for school.
6265974	eng	I'm considering doing that.
6265975	eng	Tom can do that even better than Mary can.
6265976	eng	Tom was just about to do that.
6265977	eng	I'm aware of what happened.
6265978	eng	Tom borrowed a pair of scissors from Mary.
6265979	eng	Tom was in Boston last Monday.
6265980	eng	I'll never let you do that.
6265981	eng	Tom assured Mary that he wouldn't do that.
6265982	eng	Tom was determined to do that.
6265983	eng	I'll eat when I get hungry.
6265984	eng	Tom asked if Mary was required to do that.
6265985	eng	Tom was at my house yesterday.
6265986	eng	I'll do that tomorrow, too.
6265987	eng	Tom asked Mary why she was afraid of John.
6265988	eng	Tom was also severely injured.
6265989	eng	I'll do that if you pay me.
6265990	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like Boston.
6265991	eng	Tom was able to do that today.
6265992	eng	I'll be back in three days.
6265993	eng	Tom asked Mary where she'd parked the car.
6265994	eng	Tom wanted me to speak French.
6265995	eng	I'd like to buy some pears.
6265996	eng	Tom asked Mary what time she had to leave.
6265997	eng	Tom very seldom speaks French.
6265998	eng	I'd like a chocolate shake.
6265999	eng	Tom asked Mary what she'd do in his shoes.
6266000	eng	Tom very rarely speaks French.
6266001	eng	I'd like 300 grams of this.
6266002	eng	Tom asked Mary what her favorite food was.
6266003	eng	Tom usually gets here on time.
6266004	eng	I wouldn't mind doing that.
6266005	eng	Tom asked Mary to show him how to do that.
6266006	eng	Tom usually does that at 2:30.
6266007	eng	I wonder what I need to do.
6266008	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew where John was.
6266009	eng	Tom tried to fix the computer.
6266010	eng	I won't promise to do that.
6266011	eng	Tom asked Mary if she had to do that here.
6266012	eng	Tom told us to get on the bus.
6266014	eng	Tom and Mary will visit Boston in October.
6266015	eng	Tom told us to get in the car.
6266016	eng	I won't do that any longer.
6266017	eng	Tom and Mary were still in Boston in 2013.
6266018	eng	Tom told us that we should go.
6266019	eng	I won't come to your party.
6266020	eng	Tom and Mary very often do the same thing.
6266021	eng	Tom told us about the robbery.
6266023	eng	Tom and Mary got divorced three years ago.
6266024	eng	Tom told me you could do that.
6266025	eng	I wish to remain anonymous.
6266026	eng	Tom and Mary both live and work in Boston.
6266027	eng	Tom told me which book to buy.
6266028	eng	I wish I were still single.
6266029	eng	Tom and I weren't invited to Mary's party.
6266030	eng	Tom told me to keep it secret.
6266031	eng	I wish I hadn't gone there.
6266032	eng	Tom almost forgot to tell Mary what to do.
6266033	eng	Tom told me to come to Boston.
6266034	eng	I wish I hadn't eaten that.
6266035	eng	Tom almost forgot to tell Mary to do that.
6266036	eng	Tom told me that he's thirsty.
6266037	eng	I wish I hadn't drunk that.
6266038	eng	Tom admitted that he stole Mary's jewelry.
6266039	eng	Tom told me that he's starved.
6266040	eng	I wish I could cook better.
6266041	eng	Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
6266042	eng	Tom told me that he's retired.
6266045	eng	Tom told me that he's puzzled.
6266046	eng	I went to Boston for a job.
6266047	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is going to be there.
6266048	eng	Tom told me that he's pleased.
6266049	eng	I went to Boston by myself.
6266050	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
6266051	eng	Tom told me that he's nervous.
6266052	eng	I wasn't wearing a uniform.
6266053	eng	Maybe Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
6266054	eng	Tom told me that he's jealous.
6266055	eng	I wasn't totally surprised.
6266056	eng	Maybe Tom can talk Mary out of doing that.
6266057	eng	Tom told me that he'd be fair.
6266058	eng	I wasn't telling the truth.
6266059	eng	I'd never heard Tom and Mary argue before.
6266060	eng	Tom told me that he was early.
6266061	eng	I wasn't seriously injured.
6266062	eng	I told Tom I didn't know where Mary lived.
6266063	eng	Tom told me that I'm forgiven.
6266064	eng	I wasn't here this morning.
6266065	eng	I think Tom didn't know Mary spoke French.
6266066	eng	Tom told me that I'm annoying.
6266067	eng	I wasn't at home yesterday.
6266068	eng	I should tell Tom I want him to help Mary.
6266069	eng	Tom told me his job was tough.
6266070	eng	I was too tired to do that.
6266071	eng	I saw Tom whisper something in Mary's ear.
6266072	eng	Tom told me he'd go to Boston.
6266073	eng	I was too drunk to do that.
6266074	eng	I know Tom will have to help Mary do that.
6266075	eng	Tom told me he was doing that.
6266076	eng	I was reluctant to do that.
6266077	eng	I don't want Tom to go shopping with Mary.
6266078	eng	Tom told me he visited Boston.
6266079	eng	I was permitted to do that.
6266080	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary are arguing.
6266081	eng	Tom told me he studied French.
6266082	eng	I was annoyed by the smell.
6266083	eng	I didn't think Tom would let Mary do that.
6266084	eng	Tom told me he didn't do that.
6266085	eng	I was annoyed by the noise.
6266086	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's husband.
6266087	eng	Tom thought you would do that.
6266088	eng	I was able to visit Boston.
6266089	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's brother.
6266090	eng	Tom thought he should do that.
6266091	eng	I was able to go to Boston.
6266092	eng	Do you think Tom will permit Mary do that?
6266093	eng	Tom thought he had to do that.
6266094	eng	I wanted to try to do that.
6266095	eng	Do you know why Tom and Mary were arguing?
6266096	eng	Tom thinks you should do that.
6266097	eng	I wanted to go to the lake.
6266098	eng	Do you know why Tom and Mary are fighting?
6266099	eng	Tom thinks he's a good driver.
6266100	eng	I wanted to go for a drive.
6266101	eng	Didn't you know Tom was younger than Mary?
6266102	eng	Tom sure studies French a lot.
6266103	eng	I wanted to get some sleep.
6266104	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were married?
6266105	eng	Tom sure goes to Boston a lot.
6266106	eng	I wanted to be your friend.
6266107	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were an item?
6266108	eng	Tom suggested we visit Boston.
6266109	eng	I wanted to be cooperative.
6266110	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's girlfriend?
6266111	eng	Tom suggested we study French.
6266112	eng	I want you to study French.
6266113	eng	Could it have been Tom who told Mary that?
6266114	eng	Tom suggested we speak French.
6266115	eng	I want to set up a meeting.
6266116	eng	Why should Tom have Mary do that for him?
6266117	eng	Tom studied French last night.
6266118	eng	I want to see you upstairs.
6266119	eng	Wasn't Tom supposed to do that with Mary?
6266120	eng	Tom studied French in college.
6266121	eng	I want to return to Boston.
6266122	eng	Tom would like to know how Mary did that.
6266123	eng	Tom still sometimes does that.
6266124	eng	I want to repaint my house.
6266125	eng	Tom would be willing to do that for Mary.
6266126	eng	Tom still hasn't eaten dinner.
6266127	eng	I want to remain anonymous.
6266128	eng	Tom wondered who Mary wanted to help her.
6266129	eng	Tom still has to go to Boston.
6266130	eng	I want to pay off my debts.

6266133	eng	I want to own a restaurant.
6266134	eng	Tom wondered how Mary learned to do that.
6266135	eng	Tom still does that every day.
6266136	eng	I want to eat here tonight.
6266137	eng	Tom won't permit Mary to do that anymore.
6266138	eng	Tom stays at home on weekends.
6266139	eng	I want to do that with you.
6266140	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he'll do that.
6266141	eng	Tom started out as a salesman.
6266142	eng	I want to do that tomorrow.
6266143	eng	Tom won't be able to get Mary to do that.
6266144	eng	Tom spoke with his supervisor.
6266145	eng	I want to come and see you.
6266146	eng	Tom will probably permit Mary to do that.
6266147	eng	Tom sometimes comes to Boston.
6266148	eng	I want to buy one of those.
6266149	eng	Tom will give Mary whatever she asks for.
6266150	eng	Tom signed up a long time ago.
6266151	eng	I want to become a surgeon.
6266152	eng	Tom will do whatever he can to help Mary.
6266153	eng	Tom shouldn't have left early.
6266154	eng	I want to become a fireman.
6266155	eng	Tom wasn't able to convince Mary do that.
6266156	eng	Tom shouldn't do that anymore.
6266157	eng	I want to be a firefighter.
6266158	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary to do that.
6266159	eng	Tom should've locked the door.
6266160	eng	I want to apologize to you.
6266161	eng	Tom was happy that Mary did that for him.
6266162	eng	Tom should've been suspicious.
6266163	eng	I use a computer every day.
6266164	eng	Tom was asleep by the time Mary got home.
6266165	eng	Tom should've been reasonable.
6266166	eng	I tried to remain unafraid.
6266167	eng	Tom was able to persuade Mary to do that.
6266168	eng	Tom should've been interested.
6266169	eng	I thought you weren't busy.
6266170	eng	Tom wanted to do that more than Mary did.
6266171	eng	Tom should've been helping us.
6266172	eng	I thought that I'd do that.
6266173	eng	Tom told Mary that he was ready to leave.
6266174	eng	Tom should've been handcuffed.
6266175	eng	I thought I had to do that.
6266176	eng	Tom told Mary that he was home on Monday.
6266177	eng	Tom should've been doing that.
6266178	eng	I think we need to do that.
6266179	eng	Tom told Mary that John wouldn't do that.
6266180	eng	Tom should do that right away.
6266181	eng	I think we have to do that.
6266182	eng	Tom told Mary she didn't have to do that.
6266183	eng	Tom should do that by himself.
6266184	eng	I think that I can do that.
6266185	eng	Tom told Mary not to look out the window.
6266186	eng	Tom should definitely do that.
6266187	eng	I think my new car is cool.
6266188	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted her to help John.
6266189	eng	Tom should cancel the meeting.
6266190	eng	I think it'll rain tonight.
6266191	eng	Tom thought Mary would forget to do that.
6266192	eng	Tom should be prepared by now.
6266193	eng	I think I'm going to be OK.
6266194	eng	Tom thought Mary would be retired by now.
6266195	eng	Tom should be done doing that.
6266196	eng	I think I'd better do that.
6266197	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't ready to do that.
6266198	eng	Tom should be asked to resign.
6266199	eng	I think I forgot something.
6266200	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't doing that today.
6266201	eng	Tom seemed to want to do that.
6266202	eng	I switched the computer on.
6266203	eng	Tom thought Mary had finished doing that.
6266204	eng	Tom seemed dazed and confused.
6266205	eng	I suggest you visit Boston.
6266206	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't want to do that.
6266207	eng	Tom seemed confused and upset.
6266208	eng	I suggest you go to Boston.
6266209	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't need to do that.
6266210	eng	Tom says he's never done that.
6266211	eng	I should've told the truth.
6266212	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't have to do that.
6266213	eng	Tom says he'll call you later.
6266214	eng	I should've said something.
6266215	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't do that by herself.
6266216	eng	Tom says he'd love to do that.
6266217	eng	I should've hired a lawyer.
6266218	eng	Tom thinks Mary needs to be more careful.
6266219	eng	Tom says he'd like to do that.
6266220	eng	I should've asked for help.
6266221	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably at the beach.
6266222	eng	Tom says he wanted to do that.
6266223	eng	I should wait until Monday.
6266224	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't knows what to do.
6266225	eng	Tom says he shouldn't do that.
6266226	eng	I should visit Boston, too.
6266227	eng	Tom texted Mary to tell her he'd be late.
6266228	eng	Tom says he needs another car.
6266229	eng	I should go to Boston, too.
6266230	eng	Tom strongly advised Mary not to do that.
6266231	eng	Tom says he needed to do that.
6266232	eng	I should do that right now.
6266233	eng	Tom still wants Mary to help him do that.
6266234	eng	Tom says he likes his new job.
6266235	eng	I should do that by myself.
6266236	eng	Tom still doesn't know why Mary did that.
6266237	eng	Tom says he enjoys doing that.
6266238	eng	I should be home on Monday.
6266239	eng	Tom spent the whole day thinking of Mary.
6266240	eng	Tom says he can't do that yet.
6266241	eng	I should be given a chance.
6266242	eng	Tom soon realized he needed to help Mary.
6266243	eng	Tom says he can do that today.
6266244	eng	I should be doing that now.
6266245	eng	Tom showed Mary how to tie a square knot.
6266246	eng	Tom sat there for a long time.
6266247	eng	I rolled down both windows.
6266248	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary to go home early.
6266249	eng	Tom said you're a millionaire.
6266251	eng	Tom shouldn't have asked Mary to do that.
6266252	eng	Tom said you wouldn't do that.
6266253	eng	I really didn't understand.
6266254	eng	Tom should've given Mary what she wanted.
6266255	eng	Tom said the concert was good.
6266256	eng	I never learned to do that.
6266257	eng	Tom should tell Mary what she has to buy.
6266258	eng	Tom said that he wasn't upset.
6266259	eng	I never do that on Mondays.
6266260	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants to do.
6266261	eng	Tom said that he wasn't tired.
6266262	eng	I need to talk to a lawyer.
6266263	eng	Tom should tell Mary what has to be done.
6266264	eng	Tom said that he wasn't happy.
6266265	eng	I need to start doing that.
6266266	eng	Tom should tell Mary he wants to do that.
6266267	eng	Tom said that he wasn't bored.
6266268	eng	I need to do that tomorrow.
6266269	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary to do that.
6266270	eng	Tom said that he spoke French.
6266271	eng	I need to be there by 2:30.
6266272	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's tired.
6266273	eng	Tom said something about that.
6266274	eng	I need to be ready by 2:30.
6266275	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's sorry.
6266276	eng	Tom said it was time to leave.
6266277	eng	I need to be here tomorrow.
6266278	eng	Tom should give Mary a chance to do that.
6266279	eng	Tom said it didn't bother him.
6266280	eng	I need to apply for a visa.
6266281	eng	Tom seems to be aware that Mary did that.
6266282	eng	Tom said his house was locked.
6266283	eng	I need a couple of dollars.
6266284	eng	Tom says that Mary would like to do that.
6266285	eng	Tom said he's very happy here.
6266286	eng	I may have to study French.
6266287	eng	Tom says that Mary is good at doing that.
6266288	eng	Tom said he's never done that.
6266289	eng	I may have to go to Boston.
6266290	eng	Tom says he knows Mary wanted to do that.
6266291	eng	Tom said he'll do that for us.
6266292	eng	I love the way you do that.
6266293	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary enjoys doing that.
6266294	eng	Tom said he'd take care of it.
6266295	eng	I looked up at the ceiling.
6266296	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to talk to Mary.
6266297	eng	Tom said he'd see me tomorrow.
6266298	eng	I looked down the corridor.
6266299	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary does that.
6266300	eng	Tom said he'd quit doing that.
6266301	eng	I looked down at the floor.
6266302	eng	Tom says Mary never came home last night.
6266303	eng	Tom said he'd help us do that.
6266304	eng	I looked at the fuel gauge.
6266305	eng	Tom says Mary isn't the one who did that.
6266306	eng	Tom said he'd do that for you.
6266307	eng	I looked at my watch again.
6266308	eng	Tom says Mary isn't permitted to do that.
6266309	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be there.
6266310	eng	I live in a small bungalow.
6266311	eng	Tom said that Mary would like to do that.
6266312	eng	Tom said he wasn't overweight.
6266313	eng	I like the way you do that.
6266314	eng	Tom said that Mary won't do that anymore.
6266315	eng	Tom said he wasn't having fun.
6266316	eng	I know you'll need my help.
6266317	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't very impressed.
6266318	eng	Tom said he was very confused.
6266319	eng	I know you'd never do that.
6266320	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't having any fun.
6266321	eng	Tom said he was feeling tired.
6266322	eng	I know you want to do that.
6266323	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't careful enough.
6266324	eng	Tom said he understood French.
6266325	eng	I know you need to do that.
6266326	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to talk to you.
6266327	eng	Tom said he shouldn't do that.
6266328	eng	I know you have to do that.
6266329	eng	Tom said that Mary had fun at your party.
6266330	eng	Tom said he heard three shots.
6266331	eng	I know why you got annoyed.
6266332	eng	Tom said it was Mary who stole his lunch.
6266333	eng	Tom said he enjoys doing that.
6266334	eng	I know where your house is.
6266335	eng	Tom said he's sure Mary needs to do that.
6266336	eng	Tom said he didn't have a job.
6266337	eng	I know what should be done.
6266338	eng	Tom said he's never seen Mary doing that.
6266339	eng	Tom said he didn't have a dog.
6266340	eng	I know what my mistake was.
6266341	eng	Tom said he's never been to Mary's house.
6266342	eng	Tom said I wasn't good enough.
6266343	eng	I know what it's all about.
6266344	eng	Tom said he'd do that for Mary this time.
6266345	eng	Tom said I needed to be quiet.
6266346	eng	I know what I'm up against.
6266347	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't kissed Mary.
6266348	eng	Tom said I looked very sleepy.
6266349	eng	I know this isn't any good.
6266350	eng	Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that.
6266351	eng	Tom said I looked really busy.
6266352	eng	I know this city very well.
6266353	eng	Tom said he wasn't expecting Mary's help.
6266354	eng	Tom said I looked a bit dazed.
6266355	eng	I know this area very well.
6266356	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
6266357	eng	Tom said I had to come to Boston.
6266358	eng	I know that you don't care.
6266359	eng	Tom said he saw Mary waiting for the bus.
6266360	eng	Tom really likes Chinese food.
6266361	eng	I know that I'm overweight.
6266362	eng	Tom said he saw Mary crying this morning.
6266363	eng	Tom really has a lot of money.
6266364	eng	I know that I was mistaken.
6266365	eng	Tom said he knows one of Mary's brothers.
6266366	eng	Tom rarely ever speaks French.
6266367	eng	I know not to do that here.
6266368	eng	Tom said he knew why Mary had to do that.
6266369	eng	Tom ran down the street naked.
6266370	eng	I know it's more than that.
6266371	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary would do that.
6266372	eng	Tom promised he'd check on it.
6266373	eng	I know how to speak French.
6266374	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary could do that.
6266375	eng	Tom promised he would do that.
6266376	eng	I know how to ride a horse.
6266377	eng	Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
6266378	eng	Tom promised he won't do that.
6266379	eng	I know how much it'll cost.
6266380	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary does that.
6266381	eng	Tom probably isn't hungry yet.
6266382	eng	I know exactly who you are.
6266383	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary went.
6266384	eng	Tom probably isn't afraid now.
6266385	eng	I know exactly what I want.
6266386	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary was hungry.
6266387	eng	Tom pretty much stays at home.
6266388	eng	I know a lot about sailing.

6266393	eng	Tom practices piano every day.
6266394	eng	I know a lot about animals.
6266395	eng	Tom said Mary's dog wasn't as big as his.
6266396	eng	Tom poured water over himself.
6266397	eng	I know I'm partly to blame.
6266398	eng	Tom said Mary's comments were misleading.
6266399	eng	Tom plans to return to Boston.
6266400	eng	I know I'd hate to do that.
6266401	eng	Tom said Mary would do that if she could.
6266402	eng	Tom plans to retire next year.
6266403	eng	I know I shouldn't do that.
6266404	eng	Tom said Mary will probably be back soon.
6266405	eng	Tom objected to my doing that.
6266406	eng	I know I shouldn't be here.
6266407	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't hesitant to do that.
6266408	eng	Tom no longer works as a cook.
6266409	eng	I know I can't be replaced.
6266410	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't finished doing that.
6266411	eng	Tom no longer lives in Boston.
6266412	eng	I knew I was being watched.
6266413	eng	Tom said Mary was sorry for what she did.
6266414	eng	Tom never stays out all night.
6266415	eng	I just did that last night.
6266416	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be terrified.
6266417	eng	Tom never had to study French.
6266418	eng	I hope you'll do that soon.
6266419	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be surprised.
6266420	eng	Tom never finished doing that.
6266421	eng	I hope you stop doing that.
6266422	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be skeptical.
6266423	eng	Tom needs to start doing that.
6266424	eng	I hope that'll happen soon.
6266425	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be obstinate.
6266426	eng	Tom needs to do that tomorrow.
6266427	eng	I hope it's worth the wait.

6266435	eng	Tom needed to be here earlier.
6266436	eng	I hardly ever study French.
6266437	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be incorrect.
6266438	eng	Tom must've wanted to do that.
6266439	eng	I had to do that yesterday.
6266440	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be impressed.
6266441	eng	Tom must be afraid to do that.
6266442	eng	I had no reason to do that.
6266443	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be exhausted.
6266444	eng	Tom might come to Boston soon.
6266445	eng	I had no desire to do that.
6266446	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be desperate.
6266447	eng	Tom may go to Boston tomorrow.
6266448	eng	I guess I'd rather do that.
6266449	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be depressed.

6266453	eng	Tom makes all his own clothes.
6266454	eng	I get paid to teach French.
6266455	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be back soon.
6266456	eng	Tom made friends very quickly.
6266457	eng	I found it easy to do that.
6266458	eng	Tom said Mary was glad that you did that.
6266459	eng	Tom lived in Boston last year.
6266460	eng	I felt I needed to do that.
6266461	eng	Tom said Mary was asked to do that again.
6266462	eng	Tom likes the way you do that.
6266463	eng	I expect that I'll do that.
6266464	eng	Tom said Mary wanted to do that tomorrow.
6266465	eng	Tom likes playing video games.
6266466	eng	I enjoy speaking in French.
6266467	eng	Tom said Mary looked like she was sleepy.

6266469	eng	I don't want to see anyone.
6266470	eng	Tom said Mary isn't motivated to do that.
6266471	eng	Tom likely won't be impressed.
6266472	eng	I don't want to play poker.
6266473	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still confused.
6266474	eng	Tom left for work around 6:30.
6266475	eng	I don't want to compromise.
6266476	eng	Tom said Mary is good at speaking French.
6266477	eng	Tom knows what should be done.
6266478	eng	I don't want anything else.
6266479	eng	Tom said Mary is going to take that risk.
6266480	eng	Tom knows what he ought to do.

6266489	eng	Tom knows not to do that here.
6266490	eng	I don't usually wear a hat.
6266491	eng	Tom said Mary is excused from doing that.

6266499	eng	I don't think I'll be late.
6266500	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that pretty soon.
6266501	eng	Tom just wants to stay in bed.
6266502	eng	I don't think I'll be cold.
6266503	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John did that.
6266504	eng	Tom isn't very likely to lose.
6266505	eng	I don't remember very much.

6266510	eng	Tom isn't very busy right now.
6266511	eng	I don't play chess anymore.
6266512	eng	Tom promised Mary that he'd quit smoking.
6266513	eng	Tom isn't sure he can do that.
6266514	eng	I don't often study French.
6266515	eng	Tom probably shouldn't do that with Mary.
6266516	eng	Tom isn't likely to be asleep.

6266896	eng	Do you know why Tom and Mary are arguing?
6266897	eng	Tom doesn't study French much.

6266903	eng	Tom doesn't speak French much.
6266904	eng	Did you eat an apple today?
6266905	eng	You should tell Tom Mary has to do that.
6266906	eng	Tom doesn't regret doing that.
6266907	eng	Can you sleep on airplanes?
6266908	eng	Why would Tom have Mary do that for him?
6266909	eng	Tom doesn't like to wear ties.
6266910	eng	Can you give me any advice?
6266911	eng	Tom would be surprised if Mary did that.
6266912	eng	Tom doesn't like cold weather.
6266913	eng	Can you float on your back?
6266914	eng	Tom would be impressed if Mary did that.
6266915	eng	Tom doesn't know who did that.
6266916	eng	Can you draw pictures well?
6266917	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was wearing black.
6266918	eng	Tom doesn't know what love is.
6266919	eng	Are you still a vegetarian?
6266920	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wanted to do that.
6266921	eng	Tom doesn't have many options.
6266923	eng	Tom wondered why Mary needed to do that.
6266924	eng	Tom doesn't have any problems.
6266925	eng	Are you nervous doing that?
6266926	eng	Tom wondered what Mary was going to buy.
6266927	eng	Tom doesn't do that very well.
6266928	eng	Are you likely to go there?
6266929	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's sleepy.
6266930	eng	Tom doesn't do that very much.
6266931	eng	Are you afraid to go there?
6266932	eng	Tom will give Mary everything she wants.
6266933	eng	Tom doesn't do that regularly.
6266934	eng	Yours is larger than mine.
6266935	eng	Tom will give Mary everything she needs.
6266936	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be busy.
6266937	eng	Your suitcases look heavy.
6266938	eng	Tom wasn't surprised when Mary did that.
6266939	eng	Tom does that when he's tired.
6266940	eng	Your shoelaces are untied.
6266941	eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that.
6266942	eng	Tom does that when he's happy.
6266943	eng	Your resume is impressive.
6266944	eng	Tom was the one who helped Mary do that.
6266945	eng	Tom does that when he's drunk.
6266946	eng	Your plan seemed the best.
6266947	eng	Tom was quicker at doing that than Mary.
6266948	eng	Tom does that every other day.
6266949	eng	Your plan actually worked.
6266950	eng	Tom warned Mary not to be overconfident.
6266951	eng	Tom didn't want me to do that.
6266952	eng	Your performance was good.
6266953	eng	Tom wanted to go to the dance with Mary.
6266954	eng	Tom didn't seem too impressed.
6266955	eng	Your name was on the list.
6266956	eng	Tom wanted me to go to Boston with Mary.
6266957	eng	Tom didn't seem to be unhappy.
6266958	eng	Your jokes were offensive.
6266959	eng	Tom told Mary why he enjoyed doing that.
6266960	eng	Tom didn't react quick enough.
6266961	eng	Your dog swims quite well.
6266962	eng	Tom told Mary that she was being unfair.
6266963	eng	Tom didn't plan on doing that.
6266964	eng	Your boots are very muddy.
6266965	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been punished.
6266966	eng	Tom didn't get what he needed.
6266967	eng	Your birthday's coming up.
6266968	eng	Tom told Mary that John was unconscious.
6266969	eng	Tom didn't do that on purpose.
6266970	eng	Your answers were correct.
6266971	eng	Tom told Mary that John was incompetent.
6266972	eng	Tom didn't do that by himself.
6266973	eng	Your French is quite good.
6266974	eng	Tom told Mary that John was his brother.
6266975	eng	Tom did what he planned to do.
6266976	eng	You've been a naughty boy.
6266977	eng	Tom told Mary not to do that, didn't he?
6266978	eng	Tom did that without our help.
6266979	eng	You're too young to drink.
6266980	eng	Tom told Mary how to do that, didn't he?
6266981	eng	Tom did that enthusiastically.
6266982	eng	You're too young for that.
6266983	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't do that again.
6266984	eng	Tom did that better this time.
6266985	eng	You're too shy to do that.
6266986	eng	Tom told Mary he wasn't able to do that.
6266987	eng	Tom did that again, didn't he?
6266988	eng	You're too old to do that.
6266989	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted to quit his job.
6266990	eng	Tom did almost the same thing.
6266991	eng	You're stingy, aren't you?
6266992	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want to do that.
6266993	eng	Tom definitely has to do that.
6266994	eng	You're driving too slowly.
6266995	eng	Tom thought Mary would be in her office.
6266996	eng	Tom definitely had to do that.
6266998	eng	Tom thought Mary was through doing that.
6266999	eng	Tom decided to go there alone.
6267000	eng	You're crying, aren't you?
6267001	eng	Tom thought Mary was nervous doing that.
6267002	eng	Tom cut a branch off the tree.
6267003	eng	You're a very wise person.
6267004	eng	Tom thought Mary probably would do that.
6267005	eng	Tom couldn't make you do that.
6267006	eng	You're a very hard worker.
6267007	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't likely do that.
6267008	eng	Tom could've done that better.
6267009	eng	You're a very good friend.
6267010	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't help John do that.
6267011	eng	Tom could've been back sooner.
6267012	eng	You're a very good driver.
6267013	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't forget to do that.
6267014	eng	Tom could pass for a teenager.
6267015	eng	You're a very good bowler.
6267016	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be home on Monday.
6267017	eng	Tom could easily have said no.
6267018	eng	You're a very good batter.
6267019	eng	Tom thinks Mary will do that by herself.
6267020	eng	Tom could do that if he tried.
6267021	eng	You're a very fussy eater.
6267022	eng	Tom thinks Mary probably didn't do that.
6267023	eng	Tom could be tried for murder.
6267024	eng	You're a very fast runner.
6267025	eng	Tom thinks Mary might not be interested.
6267026	eng	Tom complained about the cold.
6267027	eng	You're a tough competitor.
6267028	eng	Tom thinks Mary is reluctant to do that.
6267029	eng	Tom claims he was brainwashed.
6267030	eng	You're a terrible manager.
6267031	eng	Tom thinks Mary is motivated to do that.
6267032	eng	Tom claimed he didn't do that.
6267033	eng	You're a really smart guy.
6267034	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't know what to do.
6267035	eng	Tom can probably speak French.
6267036	eng	You're a real hard worker.
6267037	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't have to do that.
6267038	eng	Tom can do that with one hand.
6267039	eng	You're a real good friend.
6267040	eng	Tom thinks Mary can't understand French.
6267041	eng	Tom came out of the room last.
6267042	eng	You're a pretty tough kid.
6267043	eng	Tom talked Mary out of quitting her job.
6267044	eng	Tom believes he could do that.
6267045	eng	You're a pretty smart kid.
6267046	eng	Tom talked Mary into doing that for him.
6267047	eng	Tom asked me what time it was.
6267048	eng	You're a good bass player.
6267049	eng	Tom still has no idea why Mary did that.
6267050	eng	Tom asked if we had done that.
6267051	eng	You'll help us, won't you?
6267052	eng	Tom spent his summer vacation with Mary.
6267053	eng	Tom asked if he could do that.
6267054	eng	You'll do that, won't you?
6267055	eng	Tom showed Mary various ways to do that.
6267056	eng	Tom apparently has to do that.
6267057	eng	You'd be pleased, I think.
6267058	eng	Tom showed Mary several ways to do that.
6267059	eng	Tom apparently had to do that.
6267060	eng	You'd be crazy to do that.
6267061	eng	Tom showed Mary how to play the G chord.
6267062	eng	Tom and I'll do that together.
6267063	eng	You won't have to do that.
6267064	eng	Tom shouldn't have told Mary to do that.
6267065	eng	Tom and I were here yesterday.
6267066	eng	You want a job, don't you?
6267067	eng	Tom should've shown Mary how to do that.
6267068	eng	Tom and I waved to each other.
6267069	eng	You still need to do that.
6267070	eng	Tom should've given Mary his old guitar.
6267071	eng	Tom and I want to talk to you.
6267072	eng	You still have to do that.
6267073	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he has to buy.
6267074	eng	Tom and I want to get married.
6267075	eng	You shouldn't do that yet.
6267076	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to be so noisy.
6267077	eng	Tom and I want to do that now.
6267078	eng	You should come to Boston.
6267079	eng	Tom should tell Mary he'd never do that.
6267080	eng	Tom and I talked about sports.
6267081	eng	You sell used cars, right?
6267082	eng	Tom should tell Mary he won't leave her.
6267083	eng	Tom and I splashed each other.
6267084	eng	You seem to be very upset.
6267085	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's busy.
6267086	eng	Tom and I soon became friends.
6267087	eng	You say that I'll do that.
6267088	eng	Tom should ask Mary to help him do that.
6267089	eng	Tom and I rarely eat together.
6267090	eng	You say I'd never do that.
6267091	eng	Tom seems to know what Mary wants to do.
6267092	eng	Tom and I quarrel quite often.
6267093	eng	You read a lot, don't you?
6267094	eng	Tom seems to know what Mary needs to do.
6267095	eng	Tom and I often work together.
6267096	eng	You play piano, don't you?
6267097	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary did that.
6267098	eng	Tom and I often sing together.
6267099	eng	You ought to visit Boston.
6267100	eng	Tom says he'd never ask Mary to do that.

6267102	eng	You ought to go to Boston.

6267104	eng	Tom and I need to do that now.
6267105	eng	You need to do that again.
6267106	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary really did that.
6267107	eng	Tom and I met three years ago.
6267108	eng	You need money to do that.
6267109	eng	Tom says he heard that Mary wanted help.
6267110	eng	Tom and I have to do that now.
6267111	eng	You must not do that here.
6267112	eng	Tom says he heard that Mary needed help.
6267113	eng	Tom and I have started dating.
6267114	eng	You must do that tomorrow.
6267115	eng	Tom says he heard Mary tapping her foot.
6267116	eng	Tom and I had an ugly divorce.
6267117	eng	You may do that right now.
6267118	eng	Tom says he expects Mary to participate.
6267119	eng	Tom and I got married in 2013.

6267128	eng	Tom and I drank beer together.
6267129	eng	You look pretty shaken up.
6267130	eng	Tom said that Mary was enjoying herself.
6267131	eng	Tom and I don't want children.
6267132	eng	You look pretty miserable.
6267133	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be unhappy.
6267134	eng	Tom and I don't often do that.
6267135	eng	You look old for your age.
6267136	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to be careful.

6267149	eng	Tom and I can't both be right.

6267185	eng	Tom always seems to be absent.
6267186	eng	You don't do that, do you?
6267187	eng	Tom said Mary would very likely do that.

6267189	eng	You don't do that anymore.
6267190	eng	Tom said Mary would most likely do that.
6267191	eng	Tom agreed to help us do that.
6267192	eng	You did that very quickly.
6267193	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't willing to do that.
6267194	eng	Tom admits he often does that.
6267195	eng	You did that the hard way.
6267196	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't tempted to do that.
6267197	eng	Tom actually tried to do that.
6267198	eng	You could buy that for us.
6267199	eng	Tom said Mary was very unlikely to do that.
6267200	eng	Tom actually did that himself.
6267201	eng	You can stay if you want to.
6267202	eng	Tom said Mary was too stupid to do that.
6267203	eng	Tom's speech was very boring.
6267204	eng	You always win, don't you?
6267205	eng	Tom said Mary was too sleepy to do that.

6267218	eng	Tom's comments made me laugh.
6267219	eng	Will you do that sometime?
6267220	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be mistaken.
6267221	eng	Tom would be able to do that.
6267222	eng	Why should I visit Boston?
6267223	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be confused.
6267224	eng	Tom works at the post office.
6267225	eng	Why should I speak French?

6267230	eng	Tom won't likely be truthful.
6267231	eng	Why did you shut the door?
6267232	eng	Tom said Mary was just about to do that.
6267233	eng	Tom won't likely be punished.
6267234	eng	Why did that surprise you?
6267235	eng	Tom said Mary was determined to do that.
6267236	eng	Tom won't likely be punctual.
6267237	eng	Why did that interest you?
6267238	eng	Tom said Mary should do that by herself.
6267239	eng	Tom won't likely be prepared.
6267240	eng	Why can't we speak French?
6267241	eng	Tom said Mary sang very well last night.
6267242	eng	Tom won't likely be forgiven.
6267243	eng	Why can't we go to Boston?
6267244	eng	Tom said Mary probably wouldn't do that.
6267245	eng	Tom won't likely be done yet.

6267258	eng	Who was here this morning?
6267259	eng	Tom said Mary isn't finished doing that.
6267260	eng	Tom won't do that any longer.
6267261	eng	Who should I do that with?

6267264	eng	Who picked all the grapes?
6267265	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still puzzled.

6267276	eng	What did you do on Monday?
6267277	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
6267278	eng	Tom will probably be elected.
6267279	eng	What color is your new car?
6267280	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still excited.
6267281	eng	Tom will probably be curious.
6267282	eng	What are you listening to?
6267283	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still at home.
6267284	eng	Tom will most likely do that.
6267285	eng	We're looking for options.
6267286	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at cooking.
6267287	eng	Tom will likely be terrified.
6267288	eng	We'll go to Boston by car.
6267289	eng	Tom said Mary has always lived in Boston.
6267290	eng	Tom will likely be suspended.
6267291	eng	We were forced to do that.
6267292	eng	Tom said Mary has to do that by herself.
6267293	eng	Tom will likely be surprised.
6267294	eng	We speak French every day.
6267295	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John's dog.
6267296	eng	Tom will likely be skeptical.
6267297	eng	We seldom do that anymore.
6267298	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John dance.
6267299	eng	Tom will likely be impressed.
6267300	eng	We plan to attack at dawn.
6267301	eng	Tom said Mary has never met his parents.
6267302	eng	Tom will likely be here soon.
6267303	eng	We often listen to Mozart.
6267304	eng	Tom said Mary has been told not do that.
6267305	eng	Tom will likely be exhausted.
6267306	eng	We don't have tickets yet.
6267307	eng	Tom said Mary has been to Boston before.
6267308	eng	Tom will likely be concerned.
6267309	eng	We could buy that for you.
6267310	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked to do that.
6267311	eng	Tom will likely be back soon.
6267312	eng	We can't go to Boston yet.
6267313	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that by herself.
6267314	eng	Tom will likely be awake now.
6267315	eng	We can't go to Boston now.
6267316	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is.
6267317	eng	Tom will do that if possible.
6267318	eng	We agreed to speak French.
6267319	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary did that.
6267320	eng	Tom will come this week, too.
6267321	eng	We agreed to go to Boston.
6267322	eng	Tom often does the same thing Mary does.
6267323	eng	Tom will be glad he did that.
6267324	eng	Was yesterday a sunny day?
6267325	eng	Tom must've thought Mary had to do that.
6267326	eng	Tom will be awake in an hour.
6267327	eng	This is my neighbor's dog.
6267328	eng	Tom likes the way Mary plays the guitar.
6267329	eng	Tom went out to get some air.
6267330	eng	This is an excellent wine.
6267331	eng	Tom let Mary know that he had done that.
6267332	eng	Tom wasn't really good to me.
6267333	eng	This is a tough situation.
6267334	eng	Tom knows Mary won't be able to do that.
6267335	eng	Tom wasn't afraid to do that.
6267336	eng	This is a comfortable bed.
6267337	eng	Tom knows Mary no longer has to do that.
6267338	eng	Tom was wounded and captured.
6267339	eng	This is a bad translation.
6267340	eng	Tom isn't as young as Mary thinks he is.
6267341	eng	Tom was sleeping on the sofa.
6267342	eng	They say it gets hot here.
6267343	eng	Tom informed Mary why he had to do that.
6267344	eng	Tom was permitted to do that.
6267345	eng	They live in another city.
6267346	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that again.
6267347	eng	Tom was motivated to do that.
6267348	eng	They don't want to see me.
6267349	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she should do.
6267350	eng	Tom was helping us with that.
6267351	eng	These things belong to me.
6267352	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she has to do.
6267353	eng	Tom was fired for doing that.
6267354	eng	These glasses aren't mine.
6267355	eng	Tom has told Mary to do that by herself.
6267356	eng	Tom was doing that yesterday.
6267357	eng	These don't belong to me.
6267358	eng	Tom has spoken to Mary about the matter.
6267359	eng	Tom was desperate to do that.
6267360	eng	The sun rises in the east.
6267361	eng	Tom has said he won't help Mary anymore.
6267362	eng	Tom was charged with perjury.
6267363	eng	The snow isn't letting up.
6267364	eng	Tom has known Mary for a very long time.
6267365	eng	Tom was certainly not amused.
6267366	eng	The lake is far from here.
6267367	eng	Tom has done what Mary wanted him to do.
6267368	eng	Tom warned me not to do that.
6267369	eng	That's what I want to eat.
6267370	eng	Tom has advised Mary to stop doing that.
6267371	eng	Tom wants to buy another car.
6267372	eng	That's what I want to buy.
6267373	eng	Tom has a lot more books than Mary does.
6267374	eng	Tom wants me to study French.
6267375	eng	That seems to be the plan.
6267376	eng	Tom has Mary to show him how to do that.
6267377	eng	Tom very seldom has homework.
6267378	eng	Stop doing that right now.
6267379	eng	Tom had a hunch that Mary would do that.
6267380	eng	Tom usually seems to do that.
6267381	eng	Please don't do that here.
6267382	eng	Tom explicitly told Mary not to do that.
6267383	eng	Tom usually keeps to himself.
6267384	eng	Please do that if you can.
6267385	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be jealous.
6267386	eng	Tom usually does that for us.
6267387	eng	People here don't do that.
6267388	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be stubborn.
6267389	eng	Tom usually does that for me.
6267390	eng	Our flight leaves at 2:30.
6267391	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be punctual.
6267392	eng	Tom used to enjoy doing that.
6267393	eng	Our company is in trouble.
6267394	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be confused.
6267395	eng	Tom used to dance quite well.
6267396	eng	One of you has to do that.
6267397	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be careless.
6267398	eng	Tom urged me to study French.
6267399	eng	One of my cats is missing.
6267400	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
6267401	eng	Tom tried to win the contest.
6267402	eng	Now's the time to do that.
6267403	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary ought to do that.
6267404	eng	Tom took the lid off the box.
6267405	eng	None of them will do that.
6267406	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary needs to do that.
6267407	eng	Tom told us he would do that.
6267408	eng	Nobody thought about that.
6267409	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary meant to do that.
6267410	eng	Tom told us he couldn't help.
6267411	eng	No issue is a small issue.
6267412	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary knows what to do.
6267413	eng	Tom told us he could do that.
6267414	eng	My parents have separated.
6267416	eng	Tom told me that he's sleepy.
6267417	eng	My life is back to normal.
6267418	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary does that.
6267419	eng	Tom told me that he's scared.
6267420	eng	My favorite food is pizza.
6267421	eng	Tom doesn't like science, but Mary does.
6267422	eng	Tom told me that he's lonely.
6267423	eng	My father was a policeman.
6267424	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary would do that.
6267425	eng	Tom told me that he's afraid.
6267426	eng	My family lives in Boston.
6267427	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary is doing that.
6267428	eng	Tom told me he would do that.
6267429	eng	My family is here with me.
6267430	eng	Tom doesn't know who taught Mary French.
6267431	eng	Tom told me he won't do that.
6267432	eng	My dog still bites people.
6267433	eng	Tom didn't understand why Mary did that.
6267434	eng	Tom told me I should do that.
6267435	eng	My confidence is wavering.
6267436	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be punctual.
6267437	eng	Tom thought he could help us.
6267438	eng	My computer isn't working.
6267439	eng	Tom didn't tell me Mary was his ex-wife.
6267440	eng	Tom thinks he's good-looking.
6267441	eng	My car's parked out front.
6267442	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she has to do.
6267443	eng	Tom thinks he should do that.
6267444	eng	My car is in the driveway.
6267445	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he has to buy.
6267446	eng	Tom thinks I know what to do.
6267447	eng	My car has been impounded.
6267448	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he had to buy.
6267449	eng	Tom thinks I have to do that.
6267450	eng	My boss is very demanding.
6267451	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary had to do that.
6267452	eng	Tom swore he'd never do that.
6267453	eng	My birthday was yesterday.
6267454	eng	Tom didn't do what Mary asked him to do.
6267455	eng	Tom swears he didn't do that.
6267456	eng	Monday will be a cold day.
6267457	eng	Tom did what he could to calm Mary down.
6267458	eng	Tom sure has done a good job.
6267459	eng	Monday will be a busy day.
6267460	eng	Tom denied that he told Mary to do that.
6267461	eng	Tom suggested we leave early.
6267462	eng	Make sure you do that, OK?
6267463	eng	Tom believed that Mary wouldn't do that.
6267464	eng	Tom still refuses to do that.
6267466	eng	Tom believed that Mary couldn't do that.
6267467	eng	Tom still hasn't answered me.
6267468	eng	Let's go out on the porch.
6267469	eng	Tom asked if Mary really had to do that.
6267470	eng	Tom still can't speak French.
6267471	eng	Let them buy that for you.
6267472	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to work late.
6267473	eng	Tom started out as a janitor.
6267474	eng	It's your turn to do that.
6267475	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like John.
6267476	eng	Tom started out as a drummer.
6267477	eng	Tom asked Mary why he needed to do that.
6267478	eng	Tom spoke very highly of you.
6267479	eng	It's way past my bed time.
6267480	eng	Tom asked Mary where she wanted to work.
6267481	eng	Tom sold his house last week.
6267482	eng	It's too early to do that.
6267483	eng	Tom asked Mary where she parked the car.
6267484	eng	Tom should've been terrified.
6267485	eng	It's necessary to do that.
6267486	eng	Tom asked Mary what kind of car she had.
6267487	eng	Tom should've been suspended.
6267488	eng	It's important to do that.
6267489	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to do that.
6267490	eng	Tom should've been surprised.
6267491	eng	It's humid here in Boston.
6267492	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that.
6267493	eng	Tom should've been skeptical.
6267494	eng	It's foggy here in Boston.
6267495	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that.
6267496	eng	Tom should've been impressed.
6267497	eng	It's dangerous to do that.
6267498	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew who John was.
6267499	eng	Tom should've been a teacher.
6267500	eng	It's almost time to leave.
6267501	eng	Tom and Mary like the same kind of food.
6267502	eng	Tom should wait until Monday.
6267503	eng	It's all right to do that.
6267504	eng	Tom and Mary have several grandchildren.
6267505	eng	Tom should do that right now.
6267506	eng	It'll be risky to do that.
6267507	eng	Tom and Mary aren't supposed to do that.
6267508	eng	Tom should be retired by now.
6267509	eng	It'll be cheap to do that.
6267510	eng	Tom and I sat across from John and Mary.
6267511	eng	Tom should be home on Monday.
6267512	eng	It wasn't me who did that.
6267513	eng	Tom and I are in the same class as Mary.
6267514	eng	Tom should be doing that now.
6267515	eng	It was too hot to do that.
6267516	eng	Tom and I are here to help Mary do that.
6267517	eng	Tom should be asked to leave.
6267518	eng	It costs money to do that.
6267519	eng	Tom and I are both Mary's ex-boyfriends.
6267520	eng	Tom seldom gets here on time.
6267521	eng	Is it humid now in Boston?
6267522	eng	Tom advised Mary to go there by bicycle.
6267523	eng	Tom seldom forgot to do that.
6267524	eng	Is it foggy now in Boston?
6267525	eng	Tom admits that he stole Mary's jewelry.
6267526	eng	Tom seems to want to do that.
6267527	eng	I've only done that twice.
6267528	eng	The one who helped Tom do that was Mary.
6267529	eng	Tom seems to like doing that.
6267530	eng	I've never done that here.
6267531	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary did that yesterday.
6267532	eng	Tom seems to be feeling fine.
6267533	eng	I've just spent three hours studying French.
6267534	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why Mary is here.
6267535	eng	Tom seemed to be very sleepy.
6267536	eng	I've decided to volunteer.
6267537	eng	Maybe Tom can talk Mary into doing that.
6267538	eng	Tom seemed to be very hungry.
6267539	eng	I've decided not to leave.
6267540	eng	I told Tom I didn't know Mary very well.
6267541	eng	Tom says he's good at French.
6267542	eng	I've been very happy here.
6267543	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary will do that.
6267544	eng	Tom says he's been to Boston.
6267545	eng	I've been told to do that.
6267546	eng	I don't think Tom will do that for Mary.
6267547	eng	Tom says he'll do that today.
6267548	eng	I've been here since 2003.
6267549	eng	I don't like the way Tom smiles at Mary.
6267550	eng	Tom says he'll do that later.
6267551	eng	I've been arrested before.
6267552	eng	I don't know Tom as well as I know Mary.
6267553	eng	Tom says he'd rather go home.
6267554	eng	I've always loved history.
6267555	eng	I didn't pay Tom as much as I paid Mary.
6267556	eng	Tom says he wouldn't do that.
6267557	eng	I'm waiting for my change.
6267558	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's uncle.
6267559	eng	Tom says he ought to do that.
6267560	eng	I'm too young to buy beer.
6267561	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were married.
6267562	eng	Tom says he needs to do that.
6267563	eng	I'm too stupid to do that.
6267564	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were cousins.
6267565	eng	Tom said the concert was fun.
6267566	eng	I'm too sleepy to do that.
6267567	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were an item.
6267568	eng	Tom said that'll happen soon.
6267569	eng	I'm staying in Boston now.
6267570	eng	Didn't you know Tom was older than Mary?
6267571	eng	Tom said that he wasn't busy.
6267572	eng	I'm ready to leave Boston.
6267573	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
6267574	eng	Tom said last year was tough.
6267575	eng	I'm ready to go to Boston.
6267576	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's daughter?
6267577	eng	Tom said it felt good to win.
6267578	eng	I'm rather busy right now.
6267579	eng	You should tell Tom Mary won't do that.
6267580	eng	Tom said it couldn't be done.
6267581	eng	I'm not the only survivor.
6267582	eng	You should tell Tom Mary will do that.
6267583	eng	Tom said he's ready to leave.
6267584	eng	I'm not sure how to react.
6267585	eng	You should tell Tom Mary can't do that.
6267586	eng	Tom said he's doing that now.
6267587	eng	I'm not really interested.
6267588	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he did that.
6267589	eng	Tom said he's been to Boston.
6267590	eng	I'm not ready to quit yet.
6267591	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if Mary did that.
6267592	eng	Tom said he'll do that later.
6267593	eng	I'm not interested in art.
6267594	eng	Tom would've permitted Mary to do that.
6267595	eng	Tom said he'd win and he did.
6267596	eng	I'm not afraid to do that.
6267597	eng	Tom would never permit Mary to do that.
6267598	eng	Tom said he'd rather go home.
6267599	eng	I'm just about to do that.
6267600	eng	Tom would do that if Mary asked him to.
6267601	eng	Tom said he'd likely do that.
6267602	eng	I'm hoping you'll do that.
6267603	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to live.
6267604	eng	Tom said he'd do that for us.
6267605	eng	I'm going to visit Boston.
6267606	eng	Tom won't permit Mary to do that again.
6267607	eng	Tom said he wasn't in Boston.
6267608	eng	I'm glad I went to Boston.
6267609	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's sleepy.
6267610	eng	Tom said he wasn't convinced.
6267611	eng	I'm glad I visited Boston.
6267612	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's hungry.
6267613	eng	Tom said he wants to do that.
6267614	eng	I'm glad I studied French.
6267615	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's tired.
6267616	eng	Tom said he tried to do that.
6267617	eng	I'm glad I came to Boston.
6267618	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's sorry.
6267619	eng	Tom said he prefers red wine.
6267620	eng	I'm feeling a little weak.
6267621	eng	Tom wasn't sure Mary needed to do that.
6267622	eng	Tom said he ought to do that.
6267623	eng	I'm eager to visit Boston.
6267624	eng	Tom was impressed by how Mary did that.
6267625	eng	Tom said he needs to do that.
6267626	eng	I'm eager to go to Boston.
6267627	eng	Tom warned Mary not to drink the water.
6267628	eng	Tom said he hasn't done that.
6267629	eng	I'm determined to do that.
6267630	eng	Tom wants me to go to Boston with Mary.
6267631	eng	Tom said he had to walk home.
6267632	eng	I'm capable of doing that.
6267633	eng	Tom wanted to show Mary how to do that.
6267634	eng	Tom said he had to stay home.
6267635	eng	I'll try to do that today.
6267636	eng	Tom tried to talk Mary into doing that.
6267637	eng	Tom said he doesn't eat pork.
6267638	eng	I'll try to do that again.
6267639	eng	Tom tried to keep Mary from doing that.
6267640	eng	Tom said he didn't like dogs.
6267641	eng	I'll play tennis tomorrow.
6267642	eng	Tom told Mary why he wanted to do that.
6267643	eng	Tom said he didn't know this.
6267644	eng	I'll invite you next time.
6267645	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed to do that.
6267646	eng	Tom said he did that in 2013.
6267647	eng	I'll do that after dinner.
6267648	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed more money.
6267649	eng	Tom said he did that for you.
6267650	eng	I'd still like to do that.
6267651	eng	Tom told Mary what he wanted her to do.
6267652	eng	Tom said I ought not do that.
6267653	eng	I'd rather do that myself.
6267654	eng	Tom told Mary what he needed her to do.

6268051	eng	Tom insisted that I help him.
6268052	eng	I hate sitting in traffic.
6268053	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still grumpy.
6268054	eng	Tom hopes that his team wins.
6268055	eng	I had to be there by 2:30.
6268056	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still afraid.
6268057	eng	Tom helps out any way he can.
6268058	eng	I had intended to do that.
6268059	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at French.
6268060	eng	Tom hasn't agreed to do that.
6268061	eng	I had better things to do.
6268062	eng	Tom said Mary is determined to do that.
6268063	eng	Tom has to be home on Monday.
6268064	eng	I guess it's too late now.
6268065	eng	Tom said Mary has seen John doing that.

6268067	eng	I got tired of doing that.
6268068	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen him dance.

6268073	eng	I found something strange.
6268074	eng	Tom said Mary has never been to Boston.
6268075	eng	Tom has never been on a date.
6268076	eng	I feel uncomfortable here.
6268077	eng	Tom said Mary has done that many times.
6268078	eng	Tom has done the right thing.
6268079	eng	I draw pictures every day.
6268080	eng	Tom said Mary has been very happy here.
6268081	eng	Tom has done that, hasn't he?
6268082	eng	I don't want to go either.
6268083	eng	Tom said Mary has been told to do that.
6268084	eng	Tom has done that on purpose.
6268085	eng	I don't want to be lonely.
6268086	eng	Tom said Mary has been arrested before.
6268087	eng	Tom has done a very nice job.

6268089	eng	Tom said Mary has always been athletic.
6268090	eng	Tom has been crying all day.
6268091	eng	I don't want to apologize.
6268092	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that with John.
6268093	eng	Tom has been told to do that.
6268094	eng	I don't think that's mine.
6268095	eng	Tom said Mary had the right to do that.
6268096	eng	Tom has been doing that well.
6268098	eng	Tom promised to go to Boston with Mary.
6268099	eng	Tom has apparently done that.
6268100	eng	I don't really want to go.
6268101	eng	Tom probably knows where Mary was born.
6268102	eng	Tom has always been friendly.
6268103	eng	I don't read much anymore.
6268104	eng	Tom poured some wine into Mary's glass.
6268106	eng	I don't often wear a suit.
6268107	eng	Tom must've thought Mary could do that.

6268113	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said did that.
6268114	eng	Tom has a bar on Park Street.
6268115	eng	I don't need an assistant.

6268117	eng	Tom had to work hard all day.
6268118	eng	I don't like to wear ties.
6268119	eng	Tom is very sure Mary needs to do that.
6268120	eng	Tom had no chance to do that.
6268121	eng	I don't like this one bit.
6268122	eng	Tom is the only person Mary knows here.
6268123	eng	Tom had his appendix removed.
6268124	eng	I don't like the new plan.
6268125	eng	Tom is the one who helped Mary do that.
6268126	eng	Tom had a hammer in his hand.
6268127	eng	I don't like taking risks.
6268128	eng	Tom is the oldest of Mary's three sons.
6268129	eng	Tom had a duplicate key made.
6268130	eng	I don't like riding buses.
6268131	eng	Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary.
6268132	eng	Tom got married before I did.
6268133	eng	I don't like poker at all.
6268134	eng	Tom is going to permit Mary to do that.
6268135	eng	Tom got home around midnight.
6268136	eng	I don't like being pushed.
6268137	eng	Tom is at least twice as heavy as Mary.
6268138	eng	Tom got fired for doing that.
6268139	eng	I don't know who to blame.
6268140	eng	Tom has told Mary she needs to do that.
6268141	eng	Tom got fined for doing that.
6268142	eng	I don't know how to reply.
6268143	eng	Tom has told Mary not to do that again.
6268144	eng	Tom got everything he needed.
6268145	eng	I don't have that problem.
6268146	eng	Tom has more experience than Mary does.
6268147	eng	Tom got a job at a drugstore.
6268148	eng	I don't have much luggage.
6268149	eng	Tom has decided to cooperate with Mary.
6268150	eng	Tom gestured for me to leave.
6268151	eng	I don't have many options.
6268152	eng	Tom has been here with Mary many times.

6268159	eng	Tom fired back at the police.
6268160	eng	I don't have a smartphone.
6268161	eng	Tom had no idea what Mary needed to do.
6268162	eng	Tom figured he could do that.
6268163	eng	I don't have a lot to say.
6268164	eng	Tom gave Mary what little money he had.
6268165	eng	Tom encouraged us to do that.
6268166	eng	I don't get much time off.
6268167	eng	Tom expected Mary to solve the problem.
6268168	eng	Tom encouraged me to do that.
6268169	eng	I don't eat a lot of meat.

6268181	eng	I don't care what you eat.
6268182	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be nervous.
6268183	eng	Tom doesn't normally do that.
6268184	eng	I don't always get my way.
6268185	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be jealous.
6268186	eng	Tom doesn't like to be early.
6268187	eng	I do that on Mondays, too.
6268188	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be careful.
6268189	eng	Tom doesn't like sports much.

6268192	eng	Tom doesn't like hot weather.

6268207	eng	Tom doesn't care what you do.
6268208	eng	I didn't wait for my turn.
6268209	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary would do that.
6268210	eng	Tom does what he can to help.
6268211	eng	I didn't tell anyone else.
6268212	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be worried.
6268213	eng	Tom does that faster than me.
6268214	eng	I didn't see anybody else.
6268215	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be nervous.
6268216	eng	Tom does shave every morning.
6268217	eng	I didn't need to buy this.

6268229	eng	I didn't know where I was.
6268230	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary which book to buy.
6268231	eng	Tom didn't think we did that.
6268232	eng	I didn't know what to buy.
6268233	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he has to do.

6268235	eng	I didn't know their names.
6268236	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he can't eat.
6268237	eng	Tom didn't seem to be amused.
6268238	eng	I didn't have my shoes on.
6268239	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary his job was tough.
6268240	eng	Tom didn't regret doing that.
6268241	eng	I didn't have my boots on.
6268242	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary about the robbery.
6268243	eng	Tom didn't receive any reply.
6268244	eng	I didn't have any privacy.
6268245	eng	Tom didn't notice that Mary was crying.
6268246	eng	Tom didn't react fast enough.
6268247	eng	I didn't go to work today.
6268248	eng	Tom didn't like what he saw Mary doing.
6268249	eng	Tom didn't know who to trust.
6268250	eng	I didn't go into the cave.
6268251	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary's house was.
6268252	eng	Tom didn't hesitate a second.
6268253	eng	I didn't go in right away.
6268254	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was Canadian.
6268255	eng	Tom didn't finish doing that.
6268256	eng	I didn't follow the rules.
6268257	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wanted to do that.
6268258	eng	Tom didn't do that yesterday.
6268259	eng	I didn't flush the toilet.
6268260	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so hungry.
6268261	eng	Tom didn't do that very well.
6268262	eng	I didn't finish my dinner.
6268263	eng	Tom didn't do what Mary told him to do.
6268264	eng	Tom didn't do that very long.
6268265	eng	I didn't feel like eating.
6268266	eng	Tom did whatever Mary wanted him to do.
6268267	eng	Tom didn't do that last week.
6268268	eng	I didn't feel embarrassed.
6268269	eng	Tom did what Mary said he needed to do.
6268270	eng	Tom didn't do that after all.
6268271	eng	I didn't exactly say that.
6268272	eng	Tom did all he could to calm Mary down.
6268273	eng	Tom did that wrong last time.
6268274	eng	I didn't do that with you.
6268275	eng	Tom couldn't teach Mary how to do that.
6268276	eng	Tom did that without my help.
6268277	eng	I didn't do anything else.
6268278	eng	Tom couldn't talk Mary into doing that.
6268279	eng	Tom did that with enthusiasm.
6268280	eng	I didn't check my mailbox.
6268281	eng	Tom couldn't find what Mary had hidden.
6268282	eng	Tom did that three years ago.
6268283	eng	I didn't break my promise.
6268284	eng	Tom convinced Mary to teach him French.
6268285	eng	Tom did that right this time.
6268286	eng	I didn't ask for anything.
6268287	eng	Tom complained to Mary about the noise.
6268288	eng	Tom did that for three hours.
6268289	eng	I didn't agree to do that.
6268290	eng	Tom blamed Mary for all their problems.
6268291	eng	Tom did that for his brother.
6268292	eng	I didn't actually do that.
6268293	eng	Tom assured Mary that he would do that.
6268294	eng	Tom did that for a long time.
6268295	eng	I did that yesterday, too.
6268296	eng	Tom assured Mary that he could do that.
6268297	eng	Tom did that for a few years.
6268298	eng	I did that very carefully.
6268299	eng	Tom asked if Mary had to do that today.
6268300	eng	Tom did that a long time ago.
6268302	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like him.
6268303	eng	Tom couldn't do that anymore.
6268304	eng	I did that in three hours.
6268305	eng	Tom asked Mary what she was looking at.
6268306	eng	Tom could still be at school.
6268307	eng	I couldn't catch the ball.
6268308	eng	Tom asked Mary what her conclusion was.
6268309	eng	Tom could end up being fired.
6268310	eng	I cooked dinner on Monday.
6268311	eng	Tom apologized to Mary for what he did.
6268312	eng	Tom complained about his job.
6268313	eng	I can't work this evening.
6268314	eng	Tom and Mary have never been on a date.
6268315	eng	Tom comes home at about 6:30.
6268316	eng	I can't understand French.
6268317	eng	Tom and Mary have become close friends.
6268318	eng	Tom claimed he could do that.
6268319	eng	I can't speak much French.
6268320	eng	Tom and Mary are still studying French.
6268321	eng	Tom can't do that by himself.
6268322	eng	I can't go anywhere today.
6268323	eng	Tom and I were the ones who found Mary.
6268324	eng	Tom can't do that any longer.
6268325	eng	I can't get this jar open.
6268326	eng	Tom and I want to know more about Mary.
6268327	eng	Tom buys and sells old coins.
6268328	eng	I can't get my gloves off.
6268329	eng	I want Tom to show Mary how to do that.
6268330	eng	Tom bought himself a new car.
6268331	eng	I can't find my left shoe.
6268332	eng	I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
6268333	eng	Tom begged me not to do that.
6268334	eng	I can't do that by myself.
6268335	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't like Mary.
6268336	eng	Tom became a police sergeant.
6268337	eng	I can do that blindfolded.
6268338	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary broke up.
6268339	eng	Tom baked bread this morning.
6268340	eng	I can buy anything I want.
6268341	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my fiancée.
6268342	eng	Tom ate someone else's apple.
6268343	eng	I came to Boston ages ago.
6268344	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's husband?
6268345	eng	Tom ate a sandwich for lunch.
6268346	eng	I already know the secret.
6268347	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?
6268348	eng	Tom asked us why we did that.
6268349	eng	I accidentally cut myself.
6268350	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's ex-wife?
6268351	eng	Tom asked me if I liked math.
6268352	eng	How often do you get sick?
6268353	eng	Did you know Tom was younger than Mary?
6268354	eng	Tom asked me if I liked jazz.
6268355	eng	How often do you eat meat?
6268356	eng	Did you know Tom was Mary's ex-husband?
6268357	eng	Tom asked me about something.
6268358	eng	How often do you buy eggs?
6268359	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary were married?
6268360	eng	Tom and only Tom can do that.
6268361	eng	How much salt did you add?
6268362	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary were an item?
6268363	eng	Tom and I've talked about it.
6268364	eng	How many cookies are left?
6268366	eng	Tom and I weren't that close.
6268367	eng	How did you know his name?
6268368	eng	Tom's car cost a lot more than Mary's.
6268369	eng	Tom and I went out to dinner.
6268370	eng	Haven't you done that yet?
6268371	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary how to do that.
6268372	eng	Tom and I went out for lunch.
6268373	eng	Have you fixed everything?
6268374	eng	Tom wouldn't have helped Mary do that.
6268375	eng	Tom and I wanted to be alone.
6268376	eng	Have you ever owned a car?
6268377	eng	Tom would've done that if Mary hadn't.
6268378	eng	Tom and I used to be married.
6268379	eng	Have you broken any rules?
6268380	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to sit.
6268381	eng	Tom and I used to be engaged.
6268383	eng	Tom wondered where Mary could've gone.
6268384	eng	Tom and I talked about music.
6268385	eng	Giving up isn't an option.
6268386	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's tired.
6268387	eng	Tom and I still aren't ready.
6268388	eng	Don't you wish to do that?
6268389	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's sorry.
6268390	eng	Tom and I spoke on the phone.
6268391	eng	Don't you like to do that?
6268392	eng	Tom won't likely speak French to Mary.
6268393	eng	Tom and I should do that now.
6268394	eng	Don't drink anything else.
6268395	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's busy.
6268396	eng	Tom and I often jog together.
6268397	eng	Don't do that by yourself.
6268398	eng	Tom will give Mary what she asked for.
6268399	eng	Tom and I often go to Boston.
6268400	eng	Don't ask silly questions.
6268401	eng	Tom went into the cave to rescue Mary.
6268402	eng	Tom and I never eat together.
6268403	eng	Doing that's illegal here.
6268404	eng	Tom wasn't surprised by what Mary did.
6268405	eng	Tom and I met in high school.
6268406	eng	Doing that would be wrong.
6268407	eng	Tom was worried Mary wouldn't do that.
6268408	eng	Tom and I have similar goals.
6268409	eng	Doing that would be scary.
6268410	eng	Tom was the one who made Mary do that.
6268411	eng	Tom and I have been drinking.
6268412	eng	Doing that wasn't so easy.
6268413	eng	Tom was lucky Mary helped him do that.
6268414	eng	Tom and I have been arrested.
6268415	eng	Do you still teach French?
6268416	eng	Tom visited Mary in Boston in October.
6268417	eng	Tom and I had a pillow fight.
6268418	eng	Do you still study French?
6268419	eng	Tom tried to show Mary how to do that.
6268420	eng	Tom and I had a disagreement.
6268421	eng	Do you still speak French?
6268422	eng	Tom told Mary why he had to work late.
6268423	eng	Tom and I go to the same gym.
6268424	eng	Do you still do that here?
6268425	eng	Tom told Mary why he enjoyed swimming.
6268426	eng	Tom and I fight all the time.

6268822	eng	Tom seems to be very hungry.
6268823	eng	The water is really cold.
6268824	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have a boyfriend.
6268825	eng	Tom seemed to be very upset.
6268826	eng	The system isn't perfect.
6268827	eng	Tom said Mary didn't get enough sleep.
6268828	eng	Tom seemed to be very tired.
6268829	eng	The case has been closed.
6268830	eng	Tom said Mary didn't care what we did.
6268831	eng	Tom seemed to be very happy.
6268832	eng	That's a sensitive issue.
6268833	eng	Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
6268834	eng	Tom seemed to be very angry.
6268835	eng	That car used to be mine.
6268836	eng	Tom said Mary couldn't do that either.
6268837	eng	Tom seemed to be having fun.
6268838	eng	Tell me how you did that.
6268839	eng	Tom put his hands on Mary's shoulders.
6268840	eng	Tom seemed tired and hungry.
6268841	eng	Some things won't change.
6268842	eng	Tom ought to tell Mary not to do that.
6268843	eng	Tom scared me half to death.
6268844	eng	Should we come to Boston?
6268845	eng	Tom needs to show Mary how to do that.
6268846	eng	Tom says that he'll do that.
6268847	eng	Please tell us the truth.
6268848	eng	Tom likes swimming and Mary does, too.
6268849	eng	Tom says he's taught French.
6268850	eng	Please give me all those.
6268851	eng	Tom let Mary know that he had arrived.
6268852	eng	Tom says he's learned a lot.
6268853	eng	Please give me all these.
6268854	eng	Tom knows that Mary shouldn't do that.
6268855	eng	Tom says he's good at chess.
6268856	eng	Please don't do that now.
6268857	eng	Tom knew Mary was supposed to do that.
6268858	eng	Tom says he'll do just that.
6268859	eng	Please do that right now.
6268860	eng	Tom killed himself after killing Mary.
6268861	eng	Tom says he'd never do that.
6268862	eng	Please do that once more.
6268863	eng	Tom isn't as old as Mary thinks he is.
6268864	eng	Tom says he used to do that.
6268865	eng	Please do that next week.
6268866	eng	Tom is still touring with Mary's band.
6268867	eng	Tom says he doesn't do that.
6268868	eng	Please do that carefully.
6268869	eng	Tom is determined to do that for Mary.
6268870	eng	Tom says I ought to do that.
6268871	eng	Our troubles aren't over.
6268872	eng	Tom is better at doing that than Mary.
6268873	eng	Tom said the picnic was fun.
6268874	eng	Our problems aren't over.
6268875	eng	Tom is afraid that Mary might do that.
6268876	eng	Tom said that he was sleepy.
6268877	eng	Open the package, please.
6268878	eng	Tom helped Mary deal with the problem.
6268879	eng	Tom said his team would win.
6268880	eng	Only two people did that.
6268881	eng	Tom has told Mary to leave John alone.
6268882	eng	Tom said he's ready to help.
6268883	eng	One of us should do that.
6268884	eng	Tom has told Mary he needs to do that.
6268885	eng	Tom said he's in Boston now.
6268886	eng	One of us has to do that.
6268887	eng	Tom has been told to leave Mary alone.
6268888	eng	Tom said he's been forgiven.
6268889	eng	My time is very valuable.
6268890	eng	Tom has asked Mary to change her mind.
6268891	eng	Tom said he'll visit Boston.
6268892	eng	My strength is returning.
6268893	eng	Tom hardly ever talks to Mary anymore.
6268894	eng	Tom said he'll do that soon.
6268895	eng	My room isn't very large.
6268896	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she wanted.
6268897	eng	Tom said he'd fly to Boston.
6268898	eng	My room isn't very clean.
6268899	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she needed.
6268900	eng	Tom said he'd do that later.
6268901	eng	My room isn't like yours.
6268902	eng	Tom found Mary's purse under the sofa.
6268903	eng	Tom said he wasn't Canadian.
6268904	eng	My office is a real mess.
6268905	eng	Tom forgot to remind Mary to buy eggs.
6268906	eng	Tom said he was feeling bad.
6268907	eng	My name is on the ballot.
6268908	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was tired.
6268909	eng	Tom said he lost his temper.
6268910	eng	My house is easy to find.
6268911	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is hungry.
6268912	eng	Tom said he knows the rules.
6268913	eng	My friends laughed at me.
6268914	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like John.
6268915	eng	Tom said he knew what to do.
6268916	eng	My father was a preacher.
6268917	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be scared.
6268918	eng	Tom said he kept doing that.
6268919	eng	My father is very strict.
6268920	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be lonely.
6268921	eng	Tom said he did that for us.
6268922	eng	My efforts were rewarded.
6268923	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be afraid.
6268924	eng	Tom said I ought to do that.
6268925	eng	My dreams have come true.
6268926	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be absent.
6268927	eng	Tom said I looked terrified.
6268928	eng	My children love animals.
6268929	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is retired yet.
6268930	eng	Tom said I looked perplexed.
6268931	eng	My birthday is next week.
6268932	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is embarrassed.
6268933	eng	Tom said I looked horrified.
6268934	eng	Monday will be a hot day.
6268935	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is discouraged.
6268936	eng	Tom said I looked concerned.
6268937	eng	Mary has long brown hair.
6268938	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary has to do that.
6268940	eng	Make sure you're on time.
6268941	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary did that right.
6268942	eng	Tom said I had go to Boston.
6268943	eng	Look what I bought today.
6268944	eng	Tom doesn't like pizza, but Mary does.
6268945	eng	Tom refuses to speak French.
6268946	eng	Let's visit Boston first.
6268947	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't happy.
6268948	eng	Tom received a lot of gifts.
6268949	eng	Let's visit Boston again.
6268950	eng	Tom doesn't know who did that to Mary.
6268951	eng	Tom really wants to do that.
6268952	eng	Let's speak French today.
6268953	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is unhappy.
6268954	eng	Tom really tried to do that.
6268955	eng	Let's not stay in Boston.

6268960	eng	Tom put the key on the desk.
6268961	eng	Let's go to Boston again.
6268962	eng	Tom doesn't blame Mary for doing that.
6268963	eng	Tom promised that he'd help.
6268964	eng	Let's get out of the way.
6268965	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary will do that.
6268966	eng	Tom promised that he'd come.
6268967	eng	Let's do that right away.
6268968	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was pretty.
6268969	eng	Tom promised that he'd call.
6268970	eng	Let's do that next month.
6268971	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was hungry.
6268972	eng	Tom promised he'll be there.
6268973	eng	Last month was very cold.
6268974	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be sleepy.
6268975	eng	Tom probably isn't busy now.
6268976	eng	It's way past my bedtime.
6268977	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be scared.
6268978	eng	Tom prefers to stay at home.
6268979	eng	It's very creepy in here.
6268980	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be lonely.
6268981	eng	Tom plays the clarinet well.
6268982	eng	It's too late to do that.

6268989	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was embarrassed.
6268990	eng	Tom plans to come to Boston.
6268991	eng	It's not good to do that.
6268992	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was discouraged.
6268993	eng	Tom packed a large suitcase.
6268994	eng	It's humid now in Boston.
6268995	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was cooperative.
6268996	eng	Tom ought to stay in Boston.
6268997	eng	It's foggy now in Boston.
6268998	eng	Tom didn't like the way Mary did that.

6269000	eng	It's cold here in Boston.
6269001	eng	Tom didn't like any of Mary's friends.
6269002	eng	Tom often gets into trouble.
6269003	eng	It's almost time for bed.
6269004	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so upset.
6269005	eng	Tom never does that with us.
6269006	eng	It's a risk worth taking.
6269007	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so tired.
6269008	eng	Tom never actually did that.
6269009	eng	Is there any coffee left?
6269010	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was reading.
6269011	eng	Tom needs to stay in Boston.
6269012	eng	Is there any cheese left?
6269013	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wouldn't do that.

6269015	eng	Is it cold now in Boston?
6269016	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so tired.
6269017	eng	Tom must've wanted to speak.
6269018	eng	Is doing that prohibited?
6269019	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so happy.
6269020	eng	Tom must've been frustrated.
6269021	eng	I've visited Boston, too.
6269022	eng	Tom didn't even realize Mary had left.
6269023	eng	Tom must've been frightened.
6269024	eng	I've visited Boston once.
6269025	eng	Tom did that the way Mary told him to.
6269026	eng	Tom must've been astonished.
6269027	eng	I've studied French, too.
6269028	eng	Tom did that because Mary told him to.
6269029	eng	Tom must be in his thirties.
6269030	eng	I've seen people do that.
6269031	eng	Tom couldn't convince Mary to do that.
6269032	eng	Tom may speak French to you.
6269033	eng	I've never taught French.
6269034	eng	Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6269035	eng	Tom may have gone to Boston.
6269036	eng	I've left Boston already.
6269037	eng	Tom can swim at least as fast as Mary.
6269038	eng	Tom may do that if he wants.
6269039	eng	I've just visited Boston.
6269040	eng	Tom can do that much faster than Mary.
6269041	eng	Tom may do that if he likes.
6269042	eng	I've just read this book.
6269043	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that.
6269044	eng	Tom lost his job last month.
6269045	eng	I've just come to Boston.
6269046	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't do that.

6269050	eng	Tom looked like he was busy.
6269051	eng	I've finished doing that.
6269052	eng	Tom asked Mary if she liked Thai food.

6269064	eng	Tom and Mary have something in common.
6269065	eng	Tom likely won't be nervous.
6269066	eng	I'm too tired to do that.

6269071	eng	Tom knows a lot about birds.
6269072	eng	I'm smarter than you are.

6269074	eng	Tom keeps his uniform clean.
6269075	eng	I'm quite good at tennis.
6269076	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting in the lobby.
6269077	eng	Tom just did that last week.

6269084	eng	I'm not having much luck.
6269085	eng	Tom advised Mary to get more exercise.
6269086	eng	Tom isn't really good to me.
6269087	eng	I'm not doing that again.

6269597	eng	I don't have to know why.
6269598	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still weak.
6269599	eng	Tom and I've become friends.
6269600	eng	I don't have the measles.
6269601	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still lost.
6269602	eng	Tom and I'll meet you there.
6269603	eng	I don't have that luxury.
6269604	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still here.
6269605	eng	Tom and I weren't impressed.
6269606	eng	I don't have much to say.
6269607	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still cold.
6269608	eng	Tom and I were also present.
6269609	eng	I don't have an umbrella.
6269610	eng	Tom said Mary is hesitant to do that.
6269611	eng	Tom and I want to come over.
6269612	eng	I don't eat pork anymore.
6269613	eng	Tom said Mary is grateful to be here.
6269614	eng	Tom and I texted each other.
6269615	eng	I don't eat meat or eggs.
6269616	eng	Tom said Mary is finished doing that.
6269617	eng	Tom and I talked about that.
6269618	eng	I don't eat meat anymore.
6269619	eng	Tom said Mary has to be more careful.
6269620	eng	Tom and I soon fell in love.
6269621	eng	I don't eat dill pickles.
6269622	eng	Tom said Mary has only met John once.
6269623	eng	Tom and I sat on the ground.
6269624	eng	I don't care about money.
6269625	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen his dog.
6269626	eng	Tom and I sat down together.
6269627	eng	I do that whenever I can.
6269628	eng	Tom said Mary has been robbed before.
6269629	eng	Tom and I meet every Monday.
6269630	eng	I didn't win the contest.
6269631	eng	Tom said Mary has been feeling tired.
6269632	eng	Tom and I hung out together.
6269633	eng	I didn't wash the dishes.
6269634	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to do that.
6269635	eng	Tom and I hugged and kissed.
6269636	eng	I didn't want to go home.
6269637	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound surprised.
6269638	eng	Tom and I haven't eaten yet.
6269639	eng	I didn't want to do this.
6269640	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound convinced.
6269641	eng	Tom and I have an agreement.
6269642	eng	I didn't want to be last.
6269643	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound confident.
6269644	eng	Tom and I have a nice house.
6269645	eng	I didn't want to get caught.
6269646	eng	Tom said Mary didn't need to do that.
6269647	eng	Tom and I have a lot of fun.
6269648	eng	I didn't want a sandwich.
6269649	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to do that.
6269650	eng	Tom and I hang out together.
6269651	eng	I didn't try hard enough.
6269652	eng	Tom refused to tell me what Mary did.
6269653	eng	Tom and I first met in 2013.
6269654	eng	I didn't talk about that.
6269655	eng	Tom may not come to Boston with Mary.
6269656	eng	Tom and I exchanged glances.
6269657	eng	I didn't suspect a thing.
6269658	eng	Tom looked directly into Mary's eyes.
6269659	eng	Tom and I enjoyed ourselves.
6269660	eng	I didn't study yesterday.
6269661	eng	Tom likes the way Mary smiles at him.
6269662	eng	Tom and I do a lot together.
6269663	eng	I didn't stay there long.
6269664	eng	Tom knows why Mary wanted to do that.
6269665	eng	Tom and I did what we could.
6269666	eng	I didn't read the report.
6269667	eng	Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
6269668	eng	Tom and I detest each other.
6269669	eng	I didn't like what I saw.
6269670	eng	Tom knows that Mary needs to do that.
6269671	eng	Tom and I ate lunch outside.
6269672	eng	I didn't like that place.
6269673	eng	Tom knows Mary will help him do that.
6269674	eng	Tom and I argue quite often.
6269675	eng	I didn't like that movie.
6269677	eng	Tom and I aren't happy here.
6269678	eng	I didn't like being poor.
6269679	eng	Tom knew Mary would help him do that.
6269680	eng	Tom and I are very busy now.
6269681	eng	I didn't know the system.
6269682	eng	Tom knew Mary didn't have to do that.
6269683	eng	Tom and I are still married.
6269684	eng	I didn't know about that.
6269685	eng	Tom isn't sure Mary needs to do that.
6269686	eng	Tom and I are still in love.
6269687	eng	I didn't keep my promise.
6269688	eng	Tom is very sure Mary should do that.
6269689	eng	Tom and I are playing poker.
6269690	eng	I didn't have permission.
6269691	eng	Tom is very sure Mary has to do that.
6269692	eng	Tom and I are playing chess.
6269693	eng	I didn't have a good day.
6269694	eng	Tom is very happy that Mary did that.
6269695	eng	Tom and I are playing cards.
6269696	eng	I didn't go to the party.
6269697	eng	Tom is reluctant to do that for Mary.
6269698	eng	Tom and I are in Boston now.
6269699	eng	I didn't go to the dance.
6269700	eng	Tom is doing that just to annoy Mary.
6269701	eng	Tom and I are house hunting.
6269702	eng	I didn't finish the race.
6269703	eng	Tom is convinced that Mary likes him.
6269704	eng	Tom and I are having a baby.
6269705	eng	I didn't feel threatened.
6269706	eng	Tom hopes Mary will teach him French.
6269707	eng	Tom and I are back together.
6269708	eng	I didn't exactly say yes.
6269709	eng	Tom hoped that Mary wouldn't do that.
6269710	eng	Tom and I already know that.
6269711	eng	I didn't do that, either.
6269713	eng	Tom always seems to do that.
6269714	eng	I didn't do that so well.
6269715	eng	Tom has told Mary she has to do that.
6269716	eng	Tom always seems to be sick.
6269717	eng	I didn't demand anything.
6269718	eng	Tom has found out Mary can't read.
6269719	eng	Tom always seems to be late.
6269720	eng	I didn't crack any jokes.
6269721	eng	Tom has done that more than Mary has.
6269722	eng	Tom always seems to be here.
6269723	eng	I didn't comment on that.
6269724	eng	Tom has already told Mary to do that.
6269725	eng	Tom always does that for us.
6269726	eng	I didn't call the police.
6269727	eng	Tom forgot to remind Mary to do that.
6269728	eng	Tom also did that yesterday.
6269729	eng	I didn't break any rules.
6269730	eng	Tom expected Mary to do things right.
6269731	eng	Tom admitted he's done that.
6269732	eng	I didn't approve of that.
6269733	eng	Tom drives as carefully as Mary does.
6269734	eng	Tom's eyes filled with tears.
6269735	eng	I didn't answer my phone.
6269736	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that for Mary.
6269737	eng	Tom wouldn't do that again.
6269739	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was busy.
6269740	eng	Tom works in a car factory.
6269741	eng	I did that for the money.
6269742	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is tired.
6269743	eng	Tom worked on the railroad.
6269744	eng	I did that for my family.
6269745	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is happy.
6269746	eng	Tom worked here until 2013.
6269747	eng	I decided not to do that.
6269748	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would do that.
6269749	eng	Tom won't make you do that.
6269750	eng	I could help you do that.
6269751	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be upset.
6269752	eng	Tom won't likely be sleepy.
6269753	eng	I could buy that for you.
6269754	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be ready.
6269755	eng	Tom won't likely be scared.
6269756	eng	I carried both suitcases.
6269757	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be first.
6269758	eng	Tom won't likely be lonely.
6269759	eng	I can't stand doing that.
6269760	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be early.
6269761	eng	Tom won't likely be afraid.
6269762	eng	I can't leave Boston now.
6269763	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be bored.
6269764	eng	Tom won't likely be absent.
6269765	eng	I bought three notebooks.
6269766	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be alone.
6269767	eng	Tom won't buy that for you.
6269768	eng	I believe we can do that.
6269769	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is suspicious.
6269770	eng	Tom won't be here tomorrow.
6269772	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is frightened.
6269773	eng	Tom won't be busy tomorrow.
6269774	eng	I believe it can be done.
6269775	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is doing that.
6269776	eng	Tom will visit Boston soon.
6269777	eng	I always have to do that.
6269778	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary could do that.
6269779	eng	Tom will return after 2:30.
6269780	eng	I agreed to go to Boston.
6269781	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary dances.
6269782	eng	Tom will probably be upset.
6269783	eng	I agree that's a problem.
6269784	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary was born.
6269785	eng	Tom will probably be tired.
6269786	eng	How often do you do that?
6269787	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary is going.
6269788	eng	Tom will probably be ready.
6269789	eng	How do you open this box?
6269790	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is hungry.
6269791	eng	Tom will probably be early.
6269792	eng	How do you cook potatoes?
6269793	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary hates him.
6269794	eng	Tom will likely be pleased.
6269795	eng	How did you go to Boston?
6269796	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary didn't do that.
6269797	eng	Tom will likely be nervous.
6269798	eng	Have I ever deceived you?
6269799	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary can do that.
6269800	eng	Tom will likely be jealous.
6269801	eng	Don't try to do that now.
6269802	eng	Tom didn't want to help Mary do that.
6269803	eng	Tom will likely be furious.
6269804	eng	Don't scare me like that.
6269805	eng	Tom didn't want to be on Mary's team.
6269806	eng	Tom will likely be curious.
6269807	eng	Don't park your car here.
6269808	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was tired.
6269809	eng	Tom will be there for sure.
6269810	eng	Don't be late for dinner.
6269811	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was happy.
6269812	eng	Tom will be home on Monday.
6269813	eng	Doing that's a good idea.
6269814	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be tired.
6269815	eng	Tom went down to the beach.
6269816	eng	Doing that would be rude.
6269817	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be ready.
6269818	eng	Tom wasn't very suspicious.
6269819	eng	Doing that would be easy.
6269820	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be first.
6269821	eng	Tom wasn't very supportive.
6269822	eng	Doing that was very easy.
6269823	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be early.
6269824	eng	Tom wasn't very reasonable.
6269825	eng	Doing that should be fun.
6269826	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be alone.
6269827	eng	Tom wasn't very optimistic.
6269828	eng	Do you want to come, too?
6269829	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would allow it.
6269830	eng	Tom wasn't very interested.
6269831	eng	Do you mind if I do that?
6269832	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was suspicious.
6269833	eng	Tom wasn't very frightened.
6269834	eng	Do you like to wear hats?
6269835	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was interested.
6269836	eng	Tom was willing to do that.
6269837	eng	Do you intend to do that?
6269838	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was frightened.
6269839	eng	Tom was wearing a new coat.
6269840	eng	Do you have dental floss?
6269841	eng	Tom didn't think Mary looked nervous.
6269842	eng	Tom was too shy to do that.
6269843	eng	Do you ever visit Boston?
6269844	eng	Tom didn't tell me Mary was his wife.
6269845	eng	Tom was tempted to do that.
6269846	eng	Do you do that every day?
6269847	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he did that.
6269848	eng	Tom was polite but distant.
6269849	eng	Do I have to wear a suit?
6269850	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who Mary was.
6269851	eng	Tom was ordered to do that.
6269852	eng	Did you say you did that?
6269853	eng	Tom didn't really give Mary a chance.
6269854	eng	Tom was never my boyfriend.
6269855	eng	Chuck's Diner has closed.
6269856	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so busy.
6269857	eng	Tom was in court on Monday.
6269858	eng	Can you do that tomorrow?
6269859	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
6269860	eng	Tom was fascinated by that.
6269861	eng	Can I come with a friend?
6269862	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so busy.
6269863	eng	Tom was enjoying the party.
6269864	eng	Aren't you satisfied yet?
6269865	eng	Tom did what he could to rescue Mary.
6269866	eng	Tom was a railway employee.
6269867	eng	Are you happy to do that?
6269868	eng	Tom did what Mary expected him to do.
6269869	eng	Tom wanted to study French.
6269870	eng	Are you happy doing that?
6269871	eng	Tom decided that Mary should do that.
6269872	eng	Tom wanted to learn French.
6269873	eng	Are you good at baseball?
6269874	eng	Tom couldn't do that, but Mary could.
6269875	eng	Tom wanted to be a fireman.
6269876	eng	Are you afraid of snakes?
6269877	eng	Tom could try to get Mary to do that.
6269878	eng	Tom used to sell used cars.
6269879	eng	Are banks open on Monday?
6269880	eng	Tom believed that Mary would do that.
6269881	eng	Tom used to drink too much.
6269882	eng	Your room is very messy.
6269883	eng	Tom believed that Mary could do that.
6269884	eng	Tom used to be my neighbor.
6269885	eng	Your reputation is good.
6269886	eng	Tom asked Mary why she was in Boston.
6269887	eng	Tom tried to drown himself.
6269888	eng	Your name's on the list.
6269889	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had been late.
6269890	eng	Tom told me that he's well.
6269891	eng	Your answer was correct.
6269892	eng	Tom asked Mary why he had to do that.
6269893	eng	Tom told me that he's safe.
6269894	eng	You've been blacklisted.
6269895	eng	Tom asked Mary to do that by herself.
6269896	eng	Tom told me that he's last.
6269897	eng	You're the only witness.
6269898	eng	Tom asked Mary if she had to do that.
6269899	eng	Tom told me that he's fine.
6269900	eng	You're a very smart guy.
6269901	eng	Tom and Mary weren't able to do that.
6269902	eng	Tom told me that he's done.
6269903	eng	You're a very lucky guy.
6269904	eng	Tom and Mary seemed perfect together.
6269905	eng	Tom told me that he's cold.
6269906	eng	You're a very good liar.
6269907	eng	Tom and Mary often do the same thing.
6269908	eng	Tom told me that I'm right.
6269909	eng	You're a very good cook.
6269910	eng	Tom and Mary live and work in Boston.
6269911	eng	Tom told me that I'm pushy.
6269912	eng	You're a terrible coach.
6269913	eng	Tom and Mary aren't going to help us.
6269914	eng	Tom told me that I'm first.
6269915	eng	You're a strange person.
6269916	eng	Tom and Mary aren't going to do that.
6269917	eng	Tom thinks he's infallible.
6269918	eng	You're a selfish person.
6269919	eng	Tom and Mary are unlikely to do that.
6269920	eng	Tom teaches at this school.
6269921	eng	You're a natural leader.
6269922	eng	Tom and Mary are an interesting pair.
6269923	eng	Tom still wants to do that.
6269924	eng	You're a likable person.
6269925	eng	Tom and Mary are John's grandparents.
6269926	eng	Tom still hasn't kissed me.
6269927	eng	You're a good presenter.

6269929	eng	Tom still hasn't graduated.
6269930	eng	You're a good guitarist.
6269931	eng	Tom and I have a daughter named Mary.
6269932	eng	Tom shouted that he was OK.
6269933	eng	You're a good carpenter.
6269934	eng	Tom and I couldn't help Mary do that.
6269935	eng	Tom shouldn't do that here.
6269936	eng	You're a fantastic cook.
6269937	eng	Perhaps Tom went to Boston with Mary.
6269938	eng	Tom shouldn't be in Boston.
6269939	eng	You're a bright student.
6269940	eng	I'm not going to Tom and Mary's wedding.
6269941	eng	Tom should've left earlier.
6269942	eng	You're a bad role model.
6269943	eng	I shouldn't have told Tom about Mary.
6269944	eng	Tom should've been with us.
6269945	eng	You'll hurry, won't you?
6269946	eng	I don't want Tom to see Mary anymore.
6269948	eng	You were polite, I hope.
6269949	eng	I don't think Tom is as rich as Mary.
6269950	eng	Tom should've been excited.
6269951	eng	You want one, don't you?
6269952	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my sister.
6269953	eng	Tom should've been careful.
6269954	eng	You swore you'd do that.
6269955	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my cousin.
6269956	eng	Tom should stop doing that.
6269957	eng	You sure do whine a lot.
6269958	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's uncle?
6269959	eng	Tom should do that himself.
6269960	eng	You sure do sweat a lot.
6269961	eng	Did you know Tom was older than Mary?
6269962	eng	Tom should be awake by now.
6269963	eng	You sure do swear a lot.
6269964	eng	Did you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
6269965	eng	Tom seldom comes to Boston.
6269966	eng	You sure do smoke a lot.
6269967	eng	Ask Tom if he knows where Mary lives.
6269968	eng	Tom seems to be very upset.
6269969	eng	You sure do laugh a lot.
6269970	eng	Tom wouldn't permit Mary to do that.
6269971	eng	Tom seems to be very tired.
6269972	eng	You should leave Boston.
6269973	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was so grumpy.
6269974	eng	Tom seems to be very angry.
6269975	eng	You should go to Boston.
6269976	eng	Tom wondered what Mary wanted to do.
6269977	eng	Tom seems to be busy today.
6269978	eng	You seemed to be lonely.
6269979	eng	Tom wondered what Mary needed to do.
6269980	eng	Tom seemed to be very busy.
6269981	eng	You really impressed us.
6269982	eng	Tom won't like it if Mary does that.
6269983	eng	Tom says that he does that.
6269984	eng	You really impressed me.
6269985	eng	Tom will do that with Mary tomorrow.
