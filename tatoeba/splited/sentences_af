260528	eng	I will do anything for him.
260529	eng	I often visited his house.
260530	eng	I want to sing to his piano accompaniment.
260531	eng	I want to have his only daughter for my wife.
260532	eng	I interpreted what he said in French into Japanese.
260533	eng	I can't trust such a man as he.
260534	eng	I listened to some of his records.
260535	eng	I found myself listening to his records.
260536	eng	I'm looking over his report.
260537	eng	I went over his report, but couldn't find any mistakes.
260538	eng	I brushed by him while running.
260539	eng	I asked after him.
260540	eng	I went to the hospital to inquire after his health.
260541	eng	I did so at his request.
260542	eng	I can't agree with your opinion.
260543	eng	I don't make much of his opinion.
260544	eng	I cared little for his opinion.
260545	eng	It has dawned on me that I mistook his intention.
260546	eng	I envied him his good fortune.
260547	eng	I admire his skill at driving.
260548	eng	I was bored with his speech.
260549	eng	His speech made no sense to me.
260550	eng	I like his music.
260551	eng	I was impressed by his music.
260552	eng	His music made a deep impression on me.
260553	eng	I am familiar with his music.
260554	eng	I classify his music as rock.
260555	eng	Every time I go to his house, he is out.
260556	eng	I found his house easily.
260557	eng	I found his house with ease.
260558	eng	I called at his house but found that he was out.
260559	eng	I called at his house.
260560	eng	I remember calling at his house.
260561	eng	I know his family.
260562	eng	I view his error as insignificant.
260563	eng	I blamed him for his fault.
260564	eng	I forgave his mistake.
260565	eng	I'm pointing the finger at his mistake.
260566	eng	I mused on the meaning of his painting.
260567	eng	I didn't say anything to hurt his feelings.
260568	eng	Did I hurt his feelings?
260569	eng	I am sorry for his mistake.
260571	eng	I know him by sight, but not by name.
260572	eng	I was bewildered at the sight of his strange behavior.
260573	eng	I could not come up to his expectations.
260574	eng	I must live up to his expectations.
260575	eng	I struck on an idea that could change his mind.
260576	eng	I was afraid that I might hurt his feelings.
260577	eng	I lost the thread of his argument.
260578	eng	I grasped the entire structure of his argument.
260579	eng	I am not in the least afraid of his threats.
260580	eng	I praised him for his diligence.
260581	eng	I think his job resume is questionable.
260582	eng	I agree to his plan.
260583	eng	I have not the slightest interest in his plans.
260585	eng	I was ignorant of his plan.
260586	eng	I want to know the reason for his absence.
260587	eng	I don't approve of his decision.
260588	eng	I can bear witness to his innocence.
260589	eng	I was worried about his health.
260590	eng	I am very concerned about his health.
260591	eng	I could not make out what he meant.
260592	eng	I could hardly understand him.
260593	eng	I couldn't understand him; I couldn't catch on to his way of speaking.
260594	eng	I can understand him perfectly.
260595	eng	While he was talking, I guess I was absent-minded.
260596	eng	I believe what he says.
260597	eng	I felt encouraged to hear what he said.
260598	eng	I could make nothing of what he said.
260599	eng	I believe whatever he says.
260600	eng	I tried to listen to him carefully.
260601	eng	I did it the way he told me to.
260602	eng	I didn't catch what he said.
260604	eng	I could not understand anything he said.
260605	eng	I could not believe his statement.
260606	eng	I'm going to ascertain the truth of his statement.
260607	eng	I dissent from what he said.
260608	eng	I couldn't for the most part make out what he said.
260609	eng	I took him at his word.
260610	eng	I can hardly understand what he says.
260611	eng	I took note of what he was saying.
260612	eng	I can't figure out what he is saying.
260613	eng	I affected not to understand what he was saying.
260615	eng	I interpreted his remark as a threat.
260616	eng	I didn't for a moment believe them.
260617	eng	I was bored with his old jokes.
260618	eng	I followed him into his room.
260619	eng	I followed him.
260620	eng	I do not like the way he talks.
260621	eng	I consoled him with his favorite food.
260622	eng	I gave him a present in return for his favor.
260623	eng	I envy him his luck.
260624	eng	I sincerely hope for their happiness.
260625	eng	I believe that his action was in the right.
260626	eng	I don't have much belief in his abilities.
260627	eng	He succeeded to his estate.
260628	eng	I will inherit his estate.
260629	eng	I am pleased with his work.
260630	eng	I agreed to help him in his work.
260631	eng	I was at a loss how to answer his unexpected question.
260632	eng	I don't support his ideas.
260633	eng	I have a suspicion about his death.
260634	eng	I was discouraged to hear of his death.
260635	eng	I am indignant about the way he treated me.
260636	eng	My name was called after his name.
260637	eng	I dealt him a blow on the ear.
260638	eng	I was amazed at his abrupt resignation.
260639	eng	I was surprised to hear of his failure.
260640	eng	I couldn't put up with his rudeness.
260641	eng	I was embarrassed by his rudeness.
260642	eng	I didn't know how to answer his question.
260644	eng	I am familiar with the way he asks questions.
260645	eng	I'm familiar with the way he asks questions.
260646	eng	I anticipated his question.
260647	eng	I trust his executive ability.
260648	eng	I saw his car make a turn to the right.
260649	eng	I'm working on his car.
260650	eng	I demanded that they be allowed to leave.
260651	eng	I observed that his hands were unsteady.
260652	eng	I held fast to his hand.
260653	eng	I couldn't shake off his hand.
260654	eng	I do not want to reply to his letter.
260655	eng	I glanced at his letter.
260656	eng	I took him by the wrist.
260657	eng	I miss his lessons so much.
260658	eng	I have learned to draw by following his lessons.
260659	eng	I was bored with his endless sermon.
260660	eng	I took his name and address.
260661	eng	I know his address.
260662	eng	I know his address, but it's a secret.
260663	eng	I was able to find out his address.
260664	eng	I forgot his address.
260665	eng	I delayed telling him about his uncle's death as long as I could.
260666	eng	I helped him with his homework.
260667	eng	I heard news of his departure.
260668	eng	I repeated his exact statement.
260669	eng	I look to him for help.
260670	eng	I asked for his help.
260671	eng	I am sure of his victory.
260672	eng	I read not only his novels but also his poems.
260673	eng	I have read many of his novels in translation.
260674	eng	I think little of his novel.
260675	eng	I haven't read all of his novels.
260676	eng	I never read his novels without being deeply moved.
260677	eng	I haven't read his novel, and my brother hasn't either.
260678	eng	I accepted his invitation.
260679	eng	I dislike how he smiles.
260680	eng	I could not but laugh at his joke.
260681	eng	I don't like his taste in color.
260682	eng	I cannot help admiring his appetite.
260683	eng	I can't understand his psychology.
260684	eng	I didn't expect his behavior to descend to such a disagreeable level.
260685	eng	I was admiring his new car.
260687	eng	I fail to understand his true aim.
260688	eng	I would like to repay him for his kindness.
260689	eng	I relied on his kindness.
260690	eng	His kindness touched my heart.
260691	eng	I do not like the way he treats others.
260692	eng	I cannot forget his kindness.
260693	eng	I am not familiar with his character.
260694	eng	I had a glimpse into the negative side of his character.
260695	eng	I am envious of his success.
260697	eng	I am doubtful of his success.
260698	eng	I am anxious for his success.
260699	eng	When I heard of his success, I wrote a letter to him.
260700	eng	I could not find him out.
260701	eng	I am assured of his honesty.
260702	eng	I can't help doubting his honesty.
260703	eng	I can't answer for his honesty.
260704	eng	I was not interested in his life.
260705	eng	I was convinced by his explanation.
260706	eng	I can't recollect his explanation.
260707	eng	Words failed me in his presence.
260708	eng	I attended his funeral.
260709	eng	I haven't met both of his sons.
260710	eng	I have met neither of his sons.
260711	eng	I wired him a message of congratulation on his graduation.
260712	eng	I tried to repair his damaged prestige.
260714	eng	I was annoyed at his behavior.
260715	eng	I cannot abide his manner.
260716	eng	I attended the meeting in place of him.
260717	eng	I bought a new dress for her on his behalf.
260718	eng	I failed to go to his birthday party.
260719	eng	I acted on his advice.
260721	eng	I regard his advice as valuable.
260723	eng	I interpreted his silence as consent.
260724	eng	I began to doubt the accuracy of his statement.
260725	eng	I cannot but object to his proposal.
260726	eng	I politely turned down his offer and hung up.
260727	eng	I wrote down his phone number.
260728	eng	I wrote down his telephone number so that I might remember it.
260729	eng	I received a letter informing me of his arrival.
260732	eng	I impeached his motives.
260734	eng	I was surprised at the news of his sudden death.
260735	eng	I was beside myself with his sudden appearance.
260736	eng	I don't have much faith in his ability.
260737	eng	I clapped him on the back.
260738	eng	I concluded his judgement was right.
260739	eng	I threatened to reveal his secret.
260740	eng	I can't answer for his dishonesty.
260741	eng	I am annoyed by his carelessness.
260742	eng	I hesitated to leave his grave.
260744	eng	I learned a lot from his books.
260746	eng	I accepted a present from his sister.
260747	eng	I had a dream about him.
260750	eng	I was taken aback by his rudeness.
260751	eng	I don't like his rude manner.
260752	eng	I was very much shocked to hear his daughter using such bad language.
260753	eng	I don't know how to pronounce his name.
260754	eng	I know him only by name.
260755	eng	I know him by name but I have never actually spoken to him.
260756	eng	I don't remember his name.
260757	eng	I don't fully remember his name.
260758	eng	I don't know his name.
260759	eng	I have to give in to his order.
260760	eng	I looked him in the eyes.
260761	eng	I was irritated by his indecision.
260763	eng	I marveled at his courage.
260765	eng	I cannot help admiring his courage.
260766	eng	I am his friend and will remain so.
260767	eng	I am going to assert his guilt.
260768	eng	I declined his invitation to dinner.
260769	eng	I watched a ring of smoke that floated from his cigar into the air.
260771	eng	I will accept his request.
260773	eng	I cannot comply with his request.
260774	eng	I don't know the day when he will come.
260775	eng	I was forced to support his theory.
260776	eng	I was fascinated with him.
260777	eng	I prefer the updated version of his cookbook.
260778	eng	I doubt the truth of his story.
260779	eng	I was deeply moved by his speech.
260780	eng	I don't like the way he talks.
260781	eng	I leaned forward, eager to catch every word he spoke.
260782	eng	I listened to his talk.
260785	eng	I was much moved by his speech.
260786	eng	I was much impressed by his story.
260787	eng	I was much impressed by his speech.
260788	eng	I couldn't get the point of his speech.
260790	eng	I doubt his story.
260791	eng	I don't trust his story.
260792	eng	I can't bring myself to trust his story.
260793	eng	I caught him by the arm.
260794	eng	I cannot stand his arrogance any longer.
260795	eng	I can't stand his arrogance any longer.
260796	eng	I cannot put up with his arrogance.
260797	eng	I thought it best for him to say nothing about the matter.
260798	eng	I don't think he is fit for the job.
260800	eng	I am of the opinion that he will succeed.
260801	eng	I pledged my loyalty to him.
260802	eng	I don't have as much money as he does.
260803	eng	I am not more intelligent than him.
260804	eng	I am not older than he is.
260805	eng	I can't speak English as well as he.
260806	eng	I am not as tall as he.
260808	eng	I asked him if he would go too.
260809	eng	I am two years younger than he.
260810	eng	I am his junior by three years.
260811	eng	He can play the piano better than I.
260812	eng	I am older than he by three years.
260813	eng	I am taller than he.
260814	eng	I'm younger than he is.
260815	eng	I am older than him.
260816	eng	I am shorter than he.
260817	eng	I have an advantage over him.
260818	eng	I charged them too much money for their room.
260819	eng	I saw them enter the bank.
260820	eng	I sat apart from them.
260821	eng	I saw them leave the coffee shop downstairs.
260822	eng	I'm annoyed about them forgetting to pay.
260823	eng	I didn't resist the pressure they forced on me.
260824	eng	I am sure of their passing the examination.
260825	eng	I took for granted that they would give me a receipt.
260826	eng	I saw them play baseball.
260827	eng	I saw them walking arm in arm.
260828	eng	I have nothing to do with them.
260829	eng	I went to Nikko along with them.
260830	eng	I am studying it in cooperation with them.
260832	eng	I congratulated them on the birth of their daughter.
260833	eng	I feel very sorry that I had put them to so much trouble.
260834	eng	I explained the rules of the game to them.
260835	eng	I told them to study harder.
260836	eng	I gave them clothing and some food.
260837	eng	I always tried to be strict with them and not to smile.
260838	eng	I had no choice but to read it out to them.
260839	eng	I waved my hand to them.
260840	eng	I was treated like a child by them.
260841	eng	I couldn't run fast enough to keep up with them.
260842	eng	I sympathized with them, and promised that I would do what I could to help.
260844	eng	I ordered them to leave the room.
260845	eng	I am ignorant of the reason for their quarrel.
260847	eng	I know neither of them.
260848	eng	I am not concerned with their trouble.
260849	eng	I gave three pencils to each of them.
260850	eng	I saw through their plot at once.
260851	eng	I will never forget their warm hands.
260852	eng	I like their pictures.
260853	eng	I sat among them.
260854	eng	I believe in what they said.
260856	eng	I asked for their approval.
260857	eng	I know all of them.
260858	eng	I do not know every one of them.
260859	eng	I know none of them.
260860	eng	I must prepare their breakfast.
260861	eng	I interpreted their silence as consent.
260862	eng	I cannot meet their demands.
260863	eng	I gave way to their demands.
260864	eng	I don't know either of them.
260865	eng	I think they must be twins, but she says they cannot be so.
260866	eng	I suppose they are coming.
260867	eng	I do not know any of them.
260868	eng	I don't know all of them.
260869	eng	I am quite unqualified to teach them.
260870	eng	I went to the airport to see them off.
260871	eng	I dropped them off at Kanda.
260873	eng	I know them.
260874	eng	I know both of them.
260876	eng	I waited for him for an hour.
260877	eng	He shall not come here again.
260878	eng	I am to pick him up at five.
260879	eng	I saw her at the station five days ago, that is, last Friday.
260880	eng	I want to surprise him.
260882	eng	I think him a good teacher.
260883	eng	I will make him go.
260884	eng	I felt bad about picking on him.
260886	eng	It is a fact that I dislike him.
260887	eng	I made him go there at once.
260888	eng	I don't blame you for hitting him.
260889	eng	I couldn't help admiring him.
260890	eng	I know him very well.
260891	eng	I have a fine contempt for him.
260892	eng	I took him for Mr Brown.
260893	eng	I looked on him as the boss.
260894	eng	I call him Mike.
260896	eng	I don't know him at all.
260897	eng	I can't make him out at all.
260898	eng	I pointed at him.
260899	eng	I regarded him as a good teacher.
260900	eng	I remember him well.
260901	eng	I am well acquainted with him.
260902	eng	I took him aside.
260903	eng	I conducted him out.
260904	eng	I consider him a great scientist.
260906	eng	I tried to stop him, but he left me behind.
260907	eng	When I called him right-wing, I mean that his thinking is old-fashioned.
260908	eng	I barely restrained the impulse to strike him.
260909	eng	I did so with a view to pleasing him.
260910	eng	I tried to please him, which I found very difficult.
260911	eng	I said so with a view to pleasing him.
260912	eng	I can't help feeling sorry for him.
260913	eng	I cannot forgive him because he insulted me in public.
260914	eng	I took him to the Kyoto Imperial Palace.
260915	eng	I scared him out of cheating on the exam.
260916	eng	I supposed him to be rich.
260917	eng	I recognized the actor the minute I saw him.
260918	eng	I was astonished at sight of him.
260919	eng	I went to the airport to see him off.
260920	eng	I went to the hospital to visit him.
260921	eng	I have a high opinion of him.
260922	eng	I gave him a ride in my car last night.
260923	eng	I took him out for a walk.
260924	eng	I look up to him as my teacher.
260925	eng	I second his nomination.
260926	eng	I decided that he should be transferred to the branch.
260927	eng	I tried but failed to stop him.
260928	eng	I can't bend him to my will.
260929	eng	I invited him to my house.
260930	eng	I made him my servant.
260931	eng	I regard him as a poet.
260932	eng	I intended to have visited him at his office.
260933	eng	I took him for my brother.
260934	eng	I have him eating out of my hand.
260935	eng	I help him.
260936	eng	I went to the airport to meet him.
260937	eng	I have a mind to help him.
260939	eng	I could not help laughing at him.
260941	eng	I don't trust him; be careful what you say when he's around.
260942	eng	I believe in him.
260943	eng	I have trust in him.
260944	eng	I trust him because he never tells a lie.
260945	eng	I took him for my close friend.
260946	eng	I look on him as my best friend.
260947	eng	I think of him as one of my good friends.
260948	eng	I suppose him to be honest.
260949	eng	I believe him honest.
260950	eng	I cannot find fault with him.
260951	eng	I can't find fault with him.
260952	eng	I persuaded him into accepting the offer.
260953	eng	I persuaded him to go to the party.
260954	eng	I persuaded him to be examined by the doctor.
260955	eng	I persuaded him to give himself up to the police.
260956	eng	I've managed to talk him into buying a new bed.
260957	eng	I tried to persuade him, but in vain.
260959	eng	I have absolute trust in him.
260960	eng	I think highly of him.
260961	eng	Far from respecting him, I dislike him.
260962	eng	I'm waiting for him.
260963	eng	I have a great regard for him.
260964	eng	I consider him a great writer.
260965	eng	I feel very sorry for him.
260966	eng	I thought him very clever.
260967	eng	I came to know him.
260968	eng	I regarded him as the best doctor in town.
260969	eng	I regard him as an enemy.
260970	eng	I called him up on the phone.
260971	eng	I have made him angry.
260972	eng	I was careful not to say anything to make him angry.
260973	eng	I met him at Tokyo Station.
260974	eng	I rate him among the best modern composers in Japan.
260975	eng	I made an ass of him.
260977	eng	I took him for his brother.
260978	eng	I planned to introduce him to her.
260979	eng	Much as I pitied him, I could not help him.
260980	eng	He cast reflections on me.
260981	eng	I showed him into the room.
260982	eng	I visited him only to find him absent.
260983	eng	I didn't call on him because I wanted to.
260984	eng	I have never called on him.
260985	eng	I intended to have called on him, but I couldn't.
260986	eng	I will make a friend of him.
260987	eng	I made him go.
260988	eng	I forced him into complying with my wish.
260989	eng	I am going to call on him tomorrow.
260990	eng	I considered him a friend.
260991	eng	I cannot but admire him.
260992	eng	I relied on him.
260993	eng	I thought him clever.
260994	eng	I would sooner starve than betray him.
260995	eng	I tried to stop him but he made off in a hurry.
260996	eng	I have never heard her say 'No'.
260997	eng	I suggested that she go alone.
260998	eng	I was not conscious of her presence.
260999	eng	I don't know when she got married.
261000	eng	I do not know when she can come.
261002	eng	I was fascinated by her opera singing.
261003	eng	I know that she is cute.
261004	eng	I found her mending a skirt.
261005	eng	I know that she is Spanish.
261007	eng	I object to her going there alone.
261008	eng	I saw her enter the room.
261009	eng	I found out that it was difficult for her to solve that problem.
261010	eng	I am surprised that she should have done such a thing.
261011	eng	I gave her just what she needed.
261012	eng	I cannot make out what she is driving at.
261013	eng	I am quite in the dark as to what she is going to do.
261014	eng	I asked where she lived.
261015	eng	I did not notice how she was dressed.
261016	eng	I can't bear to see her cry.
261017	eng	I allowed her to go to the party.
261018	eng	I can't picture her playing the piano.
261019	eng	I asked her if she had been to Mexico.
261020	eng	Not a letter did I receive from her.
261021	eng	I was very glad to get a present from her.
261022	eng	I was expecting a letter from her.
261023	eng	I got a letter from her.
261024	eng	I received a letter from her.
261025	eng	I was invited to dinner by her.
261026	eng	She gave me several books.
261029	eng	I saw her swim.
261030	eng	I heard her speak English fluently.
261031	eng	I couldn't figure out what she was talking about.
261032	eng	I have no idea where she lives.
261033	eng	I heard her sing a song.
261034	eng	I have never heard her sing.
261035	eng	I heard her singing a song.
261036	eng	I think it certain that she will succeed as a singer.
261037	eng	I arrived at the moment she was leaving.
261038	eng	I am growing to hate the girl.
261039	eng	I hope she will get well.
261040	eng	I could hardly make out what she said.
261041	eng	I don't like her.
261042	eng	I wish her happiness.
261043	eng	I helped her wash dishes.
261044	eng	I have known her since she was a child.
261045	eng	I take it for granted that she will join us.
261046	eng	I was thinking about what she had said to me.
261047	eng	I objected to her treating me like a child.
261048	eng	I made a bet that she would win the game.
261049	eng	I heard her singing in her room.
261050	eng	I received a letter which was written by her.
261051	eng	I noticed that she was wearing new glasses.
261052	eng	I noticed she was wearing a new hat.
261053	eng	I think she is kind.
261054	eng	I was delighted at the news of her success.
261055	eng	I insist that she was honest.
261056	eng	I have known her since she was a baby.
261057	eng	I saw her crossing the street.
261058	eng	I informed him of her arrival.
261060	eng	I was glad that she visited me unexpectedly.
261061	eng	I saw her at it with great enthusiasm.
261062	eng	I was afraid of her having been punished.
261063	eng	I remember the horror I felt when she screamed.
261064	eng	I know that she is beautiful.
261065	eng	I didn't know that she was ill.
261066	eng	I was given to understand that she was ill.
261067	eng	I hope she will get over her disease.
261068	eng	I was disappointed at her absence.
261069	eng	I have never seen her help her father.
261070	eng	I didn't notice her going out of the room.
261072	eng	I saw her clean the room.
261073	eng	I helped her hang the picture on the wall.
261074	eng	I know that she has been busy.
261075	eng	I think that she will discuss trade friction.
261076	eng	I was all the more worried for her silence.
261078	eng	I wait here until she comes.
261079	eng	I can't make her out.
261080	eng	I tried to efface the memory of her tears.
261081	eng	I waited for her to speak.
261082	eng	The longer I listen to her, the less I like her.
261084	eng	I have kept company with her for about 10 years.
261085	eng	I talked to her for an hour.
261087	eng	I accompanied her on a walk.
261088	eng	I know better than to quarrel with her.
261089	eng	I'd like to go skiing with her.
261090	eng	I have to talk with her about the new plan.
261091	eng	I canceled an appointment with her.
261092	eng	I met her the year that my uncle William died.
261093	eng	I'll never forget going to Hawaii with her.
261094	eng	I've been on close terms with her since childhood.
261095	eng	I didn't get along with her.
261096	eng	I've known her for a long time.
261098	eng	I told her once and for all that I would not go shopping with her.
261099	eng	I said that I didn't go shopping with her.
261100	eng	I had nothing to do with her.
261101	eng	I almost never met her.
261102	eng	I am nearly as tall as she.
261103	eng	I shook hands with her.
261105	eng	I agreed with her.
261106	eng	I talked with her for an hour.
261107	eng	I'd like to go on a picnic with her.
261108	eng	I intended to go with her, but I was too busy.
261109	eng	I had a nice chat with her.
261110	eng	I want to make her acquaintance.
261111	eng	I hope to marry her.
261112	eng	I made up my mind to marry her.
261113	eng	I have known her for five years.
261114	eng	I am engaged to her.
261115	eng	I exchange letters with her.
261116	eng	I talked with her to my heart's content.
261117	eng	I can't tell her from her twin sister.
261118	eng	I talked to her on the telephone.
261119	eng	I am glad to have her company.
261121	eng	I will part company with her.
261122	eng	I am on visiting terms with her.
261123	eng	I couldn't tell her from sister.
261125	eng	I am friends with her.
261126	eng	I made friends with her.
261127	eng	I want to get in touch with her.
261128	eng	I had a lot of difficulty getting in touch with her.
261129	eng	I want to talk to her.
261130	eng	I told her to do that work at once.
261131	eng	I told her she looked pale, and asked if she was all right.
261132	eng	I owe her 100,000 yen.
261133	eng	I made sure to not let her do such a thing again.
261134	eng	I am going to stop her ever doing that again.
261135	eng	I met her three days ago.
261136	eng	I asked her to pick me up around four.
261137	eng	I told her to be home by nine.
261138	eng	I advised her to come by 9:00.
261139	eng	I remember seeing her.
261140	eng	I bought her a toy cat, but she wasn't happy with it.
261141	eng	I bade good night to her.
261142	eng	I offered to lend money to her.
261143	eng	I don't think she is capable of doing this job. To start with, she is far too old.
261145	eng	I argued her out of going skiing.
261146	eng	I bought a wonderful watch for her.
261147	eng	I did that which she asked me to do.
261148	eng	I asked her if she could go to the party.
261149	eng	I want her to do the difficult work.
261150	eng	I don't like her to go in such a dress.
261151	eng	I told her I'd keep it secret, so I've kept that to myself.
261152	eng	I was aching to tell her the secret.
261153	eng	I debated whether to ask her about it or not.
261154	eng	I promised her not to do it again.
261155	eng	I had difficulty convincing her of the dangers of smoking.
261156	eng	I was very worried about her.
261157	eng	I meet her on occasion at the club.
261159	eng	I made her a dress.
261160	eng	I told her what to do.
261161	eng	I'm not at all satisfied with her.
261162	eng	I have made up my mind to propose to her.
261163	eng	I counseled her to wait a little longer.
261164	eng	I am ashamed of not having been kind to her.
261165	eng	I told her not to let go of the rope, but she did.
261166	eng	I met her at the station, but I did not recognize her in uniform.
261167	eng	I said nothing to her, which made her upset.
261168	eng	I'll give her some flowers.
261169	eng	I'd like to see her.
261170	eng	I hope that I'll see her.
261171	eng	I am glad to see her.
261172	eng	I recognized her as soon as I saw her.
261173	eng	Hardly had I met her when I fell in love with her.
261174	eng	I would like to express my gratitude to her.
261175	eng	I said to her, "You look pale. Are you all right?"
261176	eng	I persuaded her to be at home.
261177	eng	I told her to quickly finish the report.
261178	eng	I am going to let her do as she likes.
261179	eng	I told her not to go.
261180	eng	I demanded that she should go.
261181	eng	I wanted her to come here this evening.
261182	eng	I asked her if I could read the book.
261184	eng	I informed her of my departure.
261185	eng	I informed her of my success.
261186	eng	I didn't have the courage to tell her the fact.
261187	eng	I informed her of my arrival.
261188	eng	I lent her my camera.
261189	eng	I showed her my room.
261190	eng	I was disappointed in her.
261191	eng	I must make an apology to her.
261192	eng	I charmed a secret out of her.
261193	eng	I remember writing to her.
261194	eng	I have no time to write to her.
261195	eng	I gave her what little information I had.
261196	eng	I can't afford to buy her a new dress.
261197	eng	I have a deep affection for her.
261198	eng	I ought to have told her the truth.
261199	eng	I made her a doll.
261200	eng	He presented her with a doll.
261201	eng	I informed her about the success.
261202	eng	I bought her a nice Christmas present.
261204	eng	I advised her to catch a morning train.
261205	eng	I ran into her in the street.
261206	eng	I wrote a long letter to her.
261207	eng	I ran as fast as possible to catch up with her.
261208	eng	I ran as fast as I could to catch up with her.
261209	eng	I meant to call her, but I forgot to.
261210	eng	I called her up.
261211	eng	I gave her a comic book to read.
261213	eng	I tried to ask her a riddle.
261215	eng	I asked her a difficult question.
261216	eng	I asked her if she knew his address.
261217	eng	I followed her into the room.
261218	eng	I got her to clean my room.
261219	eng	I told her to tell me the truth, but she shook her head.
261220	eng	I lent her 500 dollars free of interest.
261221	eng	I love her.
261222	eng	I got her a wrist watch.
261223	eng	I have three times as many books as she has.
261224	eng	I can make out what she said.
261225	eng	I'm going to her cocktail party.
261226	eng	I was worried on her account.
261227	eng	I'm not acquainted with her.
261228	eng	I am not acquainted with her.
261229	eng	I can't stand her jealousy.
261230	eng	I kept an eye on her suitcase.
261231	eng	I'm immediately behind her.
261232	eng	I like her style; she's aggressive and knows what she wants.
261233	eng	I was amazed by her quick response.
261234	eng	I will do anything I can do for her.
261235	eng	I repeated the word several times for her.
261236	eng	I gave a bunch of roses to her in return for her hospitality.
261237	eng	I regret having fallen in love with a girl like her.
261238	eng	I am concerned for her safety.
261239	eng	I was anxious for her safety.
261240	eng	I appreciated her sentiments.
261241	eng	I made her play the piano against her will.
261242	eng	I was entranced by her singing.
261243	eng	I was full of curiosity about her past.
261244	eng	I was fascinated by her sweet voice.
261245	eng	I was keyed up over her impending operation.
261246	eng	I focused the camera on her face.
261247	eng	I saw sorrow's print upon her face.
261248	eng	I stared her in the face.
261249	eng	I caught a glimpse of her face.
261250	eng	I was unable to look her in the face.
261251	eng	I took a close shot of her face.
261253	eng	I'm fed up with her complaints.
261254	eng	I don't know the reason for her absence.
261255	eng	I'm anxious about her health.
261256	eng	I heard her to the end.
261257	eng	I'm sick of her excuses.
261258	eng	I can hardly understand what she says.
261259	eng	I took what she said literally.
261260	eng	I can't make out what she said.
261261	eng	I couldn't for the most part make out what she said.
261262	eng	I gathered from her words that she liked him.
261263	eng	I could not catch her words.
261264	eng	I read anger in her face.
261265	eng	I congratulated her on her success in the examination.
261266	eng	I like her dark eyes.
261267	eng	I have done with her job.
261268	eng	I helped her with her work.
261269	eng	I stood still, my whole attention fixed on the movements of her fingers.
261271	eng	I called her office, but no one answered.
261273	eng	I noticed her hands shaking.
261274	eng	I can remember the warmth of her hands.
261275	eng	I believe what is written in her letter.
261276	eng	I must answer her letter.
261277	eng	I can't remember her address.
261278	eng	I don't know his address.
261279	eng	I spent several days sorting through her papers.
261280	eng	I can't do without her help.
261281	eng	I'm tired of her complaints.
261282	eng	I like her novel.
261283	eng	I accepted her invitation.
261284	eng	I don't like the way she laughs.
261285	eng	I had a good laugh at her joke.
261286	eng	I thanked her for her kind hospitality.
261287	eng	I gave her a present in return for her kindness.
261288	eng	I noted a trace of eagerness in her voice.
261289	eng	I had to take care of her baby.
261290	eng	I was offended by her crude manners.
261291	eng	I sat beside her.
261292	eng	I pulled her by the sleeve, but she went on talking unconcernedly.
261293	eng	I was moved by her love for other people.
261294	eng	I'm fed up with her laziness.
261295	eng	I don't like her manner.
261296	eng	I was invited to her birthday party.
261297	eng	I interpreted her silence as a refusal.
261298	eng	I wrote down her phone number.
261299	eng	I tried to find out her telephone number.
261300	eng	I was impatient for her arrival.
261301	eng	I guessed her to be 40.
261302	eng	I got very annoyed at her remarks.
261303	eng	I was fascinated by her beauty.
261304	eng	I'm very concerned about her illness.
261305	eng	I dislike her unfriendly attitude.
261307	eng	I felt drawn toward her.
261309	eng	I can't remember how to spell her name.
261310	eng	I can't think of her name at once.
261311	eng	I tried to avoid looking at her eyes.
261312	eng	I was taken in by her promise.
261313	eng	I greatly admire her for her bravery.
261314	eng	I was deceived by her appearance.
261315	eng	I like her sense of style. Her clothes and makeup always look good.
261316	eng	I gave in to her demands.
261317	eng	I was charmed by her way of speaking.
261318	eng	I don't like the way she speaks.
261319	eng	I was completely deceived by her story.
261320	eng	I listened to her story.
261321	eng	I believe her story.
261322	eng	I took her arm.
261323	eng	I thought it better that she should take a vacation.
261324	eng	I think she is sick.
261325	eng	I think she is a good dancer.
261326	eng	I love you more than her.
261327	eng	Although I am her elder, she treats me as if I were her servant.
261328	eng	I have known her for two years.
261330	eng	I took Ann for her sister.
261331	eng	I cannot praise her enough.
261333	eng	I hugged her tightly.
261334	eng	I had a good opinion of her.
261335	eng	I thought her very clever.
261336	eng	I know her slightly.
261337	eng	I caught a glimpse of her.
261338	eng	I asked her for a date.
261339	eng	I asked her for a date, only to have her say no.
261340	eng	I know her very well.
261341	eng	I suggested to him that she be invited to the party.
261342	eng	I wanted to surprise her.
261343	eng	I turned away as if I didn't like her.
261344	eng	I know her well.
261345	eng	I know her well. She is my friend.
261346	eng	I don't love her.
261347	eng	I can't help loving her.
261348	eng	I don't love her, not even if she loves me.

261350	eng	I look on her as my best friend.
261351	eng	I sent her home.
261352	eng	I cannot excuse her.
261353	eng	I excited her.

261358	eng	I want to make her happy.
261359	eng	I made her happy.
261361	eng	I couldn't stop myself from longing for her.
261362	eng	I treated her as my own daughter.
261363	eng	I was able to help her.
261364	eng	I cannot but believe her.
261365	eng	I admire her truly.
261366	eng	I consider her as an honest woman.
261367	eng	I persuaded her to substitute for me in that job.
261368	eng	I talked her into marrying him.
261369	eng	I tried to persuade her in vain.
261370	eng	I failed to persuade her.
261371	eng	I became weary of waiting for her.
261372	eng	I don't know her and I don't think I want to.
261373	eng	She is a stranger to me.
261374	eng	I gave offense to her.
261375	eng	I met her at Tokyo Station.
261376	eng	I waited for her as long as two hours.
261377	eng	It took me some time to persuade her.
261378	eng	I took her for her sister.
261380	eng	I took her for her sister. They look so much alike.
261381	eng	I made her my secretary.
261382	eng	I mistook her for Minako. They look so much alike.

262244	eng	I became aware of being closely observed by a man sitting next to me.
262245	eng	I looked into the next room.
262247	eng	I couldn't control my tears.
262248	eng	I was brought to tears.
262249	eng	I want to go abroad, for instance, to Italy and Spain.
262250	eng	I like hot tea better than cold.

262274	eng	I went as far as Kyoto by train.
262275	eng	I went to Kobe by train.
262276	eng	I like to travel by train.
262277	eng	I ran as fast as I could to catch the train.
262279	eng	I missed the train. I should have come earlier.
262280	eng	I ran to the station not to miss the train.
262281	eng	I got my foot caught in a train door.
262282	eng	I came across him on the train.
262283	eng	It occurred to me that I had left my bag on the train.
262284	eng	I call my sweetheart darling.
262286	eng	I was wet with dew.
262287	eng	I stood up for an old man old man to take my seat.
262288	eng	I stood at a respectful distance from the old man.
262289	eng	I remember asking an old man the way.
262290	eng	I'm saying this out of kindness.
262291	eng	I helped an old woman across the street.
262292	eng	I gave up my seat to an old lady.
262293	eng	I gave up smoking six months ago.
262294	eng	I got up about six.
262296	eng	I got up at six.

262301	eng	I will be back at half past six.
262302	eng	I get up at 6:30.
262303	eng	I have been studying English for six years now.
262304	eng	I've made a first draft of my thesis.
262305	eng	I had to work on an essay.
262306	eng	I meant to have finished writing the paper.
262307	eng	I need a Japanese-English dictionary.
262308	eng	I don't like to be spoken to.
262309	eng	I experienced a feeling of antipathy towards the speaker.
262310	eng	I want somebody to talk to.
262312	eng	I tried to change the subject.
262313	eng	I tried to change the subject, but they went on talking about politics.
262314	eng	My arm is hurting badly.
262315	eng	I broke my arm.
262316	eng	I must have my watch repaired.
262317	eng	I stood with my arms folded.
262318	eng	I'm a person who lives for the moment.
262319	eng	I tried to open the door with all my force.

262321	eng	You must make good on your promise to me.
262322	eng	No one admires him more than I do.
262323	eng	I don't like it, either.
262324	eng	So do I.
262325	eng	I am seventeen years old, too.
262326	eng	I didn't know you were coming here either.
262327	eng	I'm glad to meet you, too.
262328	eng	I want to have a part-time job, too.
262329	eng	Please take me along with you.
262330	eng	Nice seeing you, too.
262331	eng	This is also the first time I've been to this area.
262332	eng	I myself did not know him.
262333	eng	I'm a stranger here myself.
262334	eng	I'm a stranger here myself. I'm afraid I can't help you.
262335	eng	I would not have known him.
262336	eng	I wish I could find one just like it.
262337	eng	I don't, either.
262338	eng	Nor am I.
262339	eng	I think so, too.
262340	eng	I get off there, too.
262341	eng	I've been invited there, too.
262342	eng	I also went there.
262343	eng	I've heard a lot about that, too.
262345	eng	I was just thinking of the same thing. I'm all for that.

262352	eng	I like English, too.
262353	eng	I will also become a grown-up before long.
262354	eng	I love music, too.
262355	eng	All of us, including me, rode the bus.
262356	eng	I am no more interested in physics than you are.
262357	eng	I'm fine too.
262358	eng	I also went.
262359	eng	Let me in under your umbrella.
262360	eng	I also heard a similar story.
262361	eng	I can ride a horse, too.
262362	eng	I am a teacher, too.
262363	eng	I am also a citizen of Tokyo.
262364	eng	I'd like to order the same.
262365	eng	I will do it the same.
262366	eng	I do not like him either.
262367	eng	I wish I could swim as far as he can.
262368	eng	You and I are both students at this school.
262369	eng	I also stopped sleeping.
262370	eng	Mother is more anxious about the result of the examination than I am.
262371	eng	He cannot be older than I.
262372	eng	He is my senior by three years.
262375	eng	Do you take me for forty? You are wide of the mark.
262376	eng	It is no use trying to deceive me.
262377	eng	Please show me around.
262378	eng	You can't bend me to your will.
262379	eng	Would you introduce me to your friend, Mr Murphy?
262380	eng	Don't pick on me, please.
262381	eng	I entreat your pardon.
262382	eng	Don't let me down.
262383	eng	Don't make sport of me.
262385	eng	Please call me Joe.
262386	eng	Send me there.
262387	eng	Don't apply that nickname to me.
262388	eng	It is very kind of you to invite me to the party.
262389	eng	They had great fun at my expense.
262390	eng	Deceive me once, and I will forgive you; deceive me twice, and you're a double-crosser.
262392	eng	It is no use trying to play a trick on me.
262393	eng	The ones who shout at me don't bother me.
262396	eng	You can call me Bob.
262397	eng	Could you introduce me to Mr Ono of Randolph, Ltd?
262400	eng	Please leave me alone. I am busy.
262401	eng	I think I can reach the branch if you'll give me a boost.
262402	eng	It is kind of you to drive me home.
262403	eng	Later, the nurse told me she had done her best to make me well.
262404	eng	Don't make little of me.
262405	eng	What surprised me was his cold attitude.
262407	eng	Please look at me.
262408	eng	Seeing me, the dog wagged its tail.
262409	eng	Seeing me, she was embarrassed.
262410	eng	He looked at me and barked.
262411	eng	Seeing me, the baby began to cry.
262412	eng	Look at me.
262413	eng	No sooner had he seen me than he began to run away.
262414	eng	Seeing me, the dog rushed up to me.
262415	eng	As soon as she saw me, she greeted me with a smile.
262417	eng	Stop bothering me!
262418	eng	Don't treat me like a child.
262419	eng	I hope you will hear me out.
262420	eng	It was the teacher's narrative that bored me to death.
262421	eng	It was his lengthy narrative that bored me to death.
262422	eng	It is kind of you to give me a ride.
262423	eng	Please come to my room to help me.
262424	eng	Please help me.
262425	eng	It is very kind of you to help me.

262427	eng	It is kind of her to help me.
262428	eng	How kind of you to help me!
262429	eng	Let me step inside.
262430	eng	I'll be glad if you will help me.
262431	eng	He took a risk when he helped me.
262435	eng	I have no one to help me.
262436	eng	I have a lot of friends to help me.
262437	eng	I intend to decline his offer to help me.
262438	eng	It is very kind of you to invite me.
262439	eng	How nice of you to invite me along!
262440	eng	Don't laugh at me.
262441	eng	Don't wait dinner for me.
262443	eng	Don't leave me behind!
262444	eng	Let me in, please.
262445	eng	Don't bar me out.
262447	eng	Tell him either to call on me or to ring me up.
262448	eng	Don't pass me over.
262449	eng	Will you take me to the gate?
262450	eng	It is very kind of you to invite me to dinner.
262451	eng	It is kind of him to invite me to dinner.
262452	eng	You won't let me down.
262453	eng	The girl staring back at me was angry.
262454	eng	Don't deceive me.
262455	eng	Are there any messages for me?
262457	eng	Nobody has heard of it but me.
262458	eng	All the members but me have faith in what he says.
262459	eng	Everybody knows it except me.
262460	eng	Everyone except me knew it.
262461	eng	Everyone except me was invited.
262462	eng	Everybody is busy except me.
262463	eng	From my personal point of view, his opinion is right.
262464	eng	For myself, I would like to take part in the game.
262465	eng	In my personal opinion I am against the plan.
262466	eng	Let me give you my personal opinion.
262467	eng	Get off my back about my personal life!
262470	eng	Methinks my own soul must be a bright invisible green.
262471	eng	Don't interfere in private concerns.
262472	eng	I myself did it.
262473	eng	I'll get my son to go instead of going myself.
262474	eng	I myself saw it.
262475	eng	As for me, instead of trying to be a cool, international man, I would like to be an open-minded earth person.
262476	eng	I wish I had a room of my own.
262477	eng	I myself have never seen a UFO.
262478	eng	I have never been there myself.
262479	eng	Don't pry into my private life.
262481	eng	We're going to the movies. Are you game?
262483	eng	We have freed you from a great anxiety.
262484	eng	It is impossible for us to cross that river.
262485	eng	There is no telling when we will fall ill.
262487	eng	When we went to karaoke, Tom went on singing all night.
262488	eng	We arrived here fast, didn't we?
262489	eng	It is becoming important for us to know how to use a computer.
262490	eng	Two hours is too short for us to discuss the matter.
262492	eng	We do not all go.
262493	eng	The field where we used to play ball is now all built up.
262494	eng	Even though we tried hard, we couldn't beat Jane.
262495	eng	When we got to the station, the train had already left.
262496	eng	By the time we reached home, the sun had completely set.
262497	eng	When we went to the hall, the concert had already begun.
262498	eng	Three years have passed since we married.
262499	eng	When we say that a language is culturally transmitted - that is, that it is learned rather than inherited - we mean that it is part of that whole complex of learned and shared behavior that anthropologists call culture.
262500	eng	The man whom we saw in the park was Mr Hill.
262501	eng	There are not enough chairs for us to sit on.
262503	eng	The music we listened to last night was wonderful.
262504	eng	The best policy for us to observe is to mind our own business.
262505	eng	In modern times we have gone through two world wars as the end result of international disputes.
262506	eng	In spite of our congratulations, he frowned and turned away.
262508	eng	Is there anyone we invited who hasn't come yet?
262509	eng	Our bus left at eight, arriving in Boston at eleven.
262510	eng	The bullet train we were on pulled out at 12 sharp.
262511	eng	Your help is indispensable to our success.

262514	eng	The day when we arrived was a holiday.
262515	eng	It was raining when we arrived.
262517	eng	The English Channel was rough when we came across.
262518	eng	The higher we go up, the thinner the air becomes.
262519	eng	They gave us a hearty welcome when we arrived.
262520	eng	It began to rain as we came near the pass.
262521	eng	The hotel which I am staying at is near the station.
262522	eng	The hotel at which we stayed was very comfortable.
262523	eng	There was nothing that we could do for them.
262524	eng	There is enough room for us to play.
262525	eng	It is a good idea for us to play shogi after dinner.
262526	eng	Beth looked after our dog while we were away.
262527	eng	We had an unpleasant experience there.
262528	eng	Would you like to eat with us?
262530	eng	Would you like to play soccer with us?
262531	eng	Won't you join us for dinner?
262532	eng	Let's ask some questions.
262533	eng	It's great fun for us to be with her.
262534	eng	It makes a difference to us whether it rains tomorrow.
262535	eng	Give us two knives and four forks, please.
262536	eng	We have the ability to memorize information.
262537	eng	We have everything we need; money, time, and brains.
262538	eng	We had a pleasant evening.
262539	eng	We have a lot of homework to do.
262541	eng	We have many friends to visit in Tokyo.
262544	eng	I asked the waiter to see about getting us a better table.
262545	eng	Don't forget to write to us.
262546	eng	None of us have succeeded.
262547	eng	None of us could arrive at the harbor on time.
262548	eng	Our class consists of thirty students.
262550	eng	Our class will go on a picnic next week.
262551	eng	Our soccer game will be postponed.
262552	eng	Not all of us are against his idea.
262554	eng	Our team did very well.
262555	eng	Our football team has a good defense.
262556	eng	Our team triumphed over theirs.
262558	eng	Our hotel faces the coast.
262559	eng	Some of us went by bus, and the others by bicycle.

262574	eng	I hope to see our relationship expand.
262575	eng	Our basic problem is the lack of know-how.
262577	eng	Our holiday plans are still up in the air.
262578	eng	The air we breathe consists of oxygen and nitrogen.
262579	eng	All our plans went wrong.
262580	eng	Our plans went wrong.
262581	eng	Our plan was objected to by the majority.
262583	eng	Our dog will bite strangers.
262584	eng	You shall listen to us.

262592	eng	All our attempts failed.
262593	eng	Don't worry about us.
262594	eng	Our car ran out of gas after two minutes.

273627	eng	The solution of one may prove to be the solution of the other.
273628	eng	Many support the former alternative, but I prefer the latter.
273629	eng	The former is better than the latter.

273675	eng	How lonely and helpless she must feel left all by herself!
273677	eng	He is utterly impossible.
273678	eng	That is not all together false.

273730	eng	All things considered, we cannot say that he is wrong.
273731	eng	All things considered, I think you should go back home and support your old parents.
273732	eng	Everything was done in accordance with the rules.
273733	eng	I like none of them.
273734	eng	Do everything according to the cookbook.
273735	eng	The whole company stood in silence for a few moments, as a tribute to the dead.

276055	eng	In the second place, if we do not go, someone else will read the inscription on the stone and find happiness, and we shall have lost it all.

282712	eng	The other boys teased him when he got his hair cut.
282714	eng	I have to comb my hair.
282715	eng	I used a ribbon to tie my hair into a ponytail.
282716	eng	You should go and have your hair cut.
282717	eng	Bind one's hair at the back.
282718	eng	I've got to fix my hair.
282719	eng	I'd like you to cut my hair.
282721	eng	You look nice with your hair short.
282722	eng	A girl came running, with her hair streaming in the wind.
282723	eng	Didn't it ever occur to them that they would be punished?
282724	eng	She resolved not to pay the fine.
282725	eng	The fine shall be paid in cash.
282726	eng	A lot of my hair has fallen out.
282727	eng	Is there any other way besides extraction?
282728	eng	Your tooth must be extracted.
282729	eng	Should I have my tooth extracted?
282730	eng	Thanks to a fundamental restructuring, our surplus has swelled three-fold.
282731	eng	Thank to a fundamental restructuring, our surplus has swelled threefold.
282732	eng	The pigeon has flown away.
282733	eng	The judgement went against the government.
282734	eng	The judgement was against him.
282735	eng	The decision was in favor of the defendant.
282736	eng	Judgement will be given tomorrow.
282737	eng	The judge can't stop.
282739	eng	The judge was exhausted from the nervous strain.
282740	eng	The judge sentenced him to one year's imprisonment.
282741	eng	The judge bound the spectators to keep quiet.
282742	eng	He will be here in half an hour.
282743	eng	It rained like mad for about a half-hour.
282744	eng	Half of the melons were eaten.
282745	eng	Show me short-sleeved ones, please.
282746	eng	I only ride a bicycle at odd times.
282747	eng	Do you offer any half-day tours?
282748	eng	You must come every six months for a check-up.
282749	eng	Six months ago I had an operation for the cataract in my right eye.
282750	eng	I had a Caesarian section six months ago.
282751	eng	Give me half of it.
282752	eng	Half-forgotten music danced through his mind.
282753	eng	You'll get brownie points if you respond quickly.
282754	eng	The anti-nuclear energy movement is being led by a number of organizations.
282756	eng	The rebels made a barricade across the road.
282757	eng	The rebel was ultimately captured and confined to prison.
282759	eng	The rebels took control of the capital.
282760	eng	Rebellion it always sells at a profit.
282761	eng	The defiant manner is characteristic of teenagers.
282762	eng	Opposition leaders say it's possible the Communists could end up in a small minority.
282763	eng	All political dissidents were purged under the former regime.
282764	eng	He couldn't help doing so in the face of opposition.
282765	eng	I had no desire to say anything against you.
282766	eng	The members of the opposition party were enraged against the bill.
282767	eng	The noes have it.
282768	eng	A rebellion was brewing.
282769	eng	A revolt broke out.
282770	eng	The revolt was crushed.
282771	eng	The rebel concealed his ambition to destroy the regime.
282772	eng	The rebels have captured the broadcasting station.
282773	eng	The wind filled the sails.
282774	eng	The sails fluttered in the wind.
282775	eng	All the sails were taken down.
282776	eng	He hammered nails into the plank.
282777	eng	Boards are used to make floors.
282778	eng	The plank froze to the ground.
282779	eng	Crime is on the increase.
282780	eng	It cannot be denied that crime is on the increase.
282781	eng	Every crime calls for punishment.
282782	eng	Crime has often been related to poverty.
282783	eng	Crime does not pay.
282784	eng	Crime doesn't pay.
282786	eng	Crimes sometimes result from ignorance of the law.
282787	eng	Criminals are deprived of social rights.
282788	eng	The criminal got very tired from the fight with the two officers.
282789	eng	Criminals generally do not single out police officers.
282790	eng	I was asked to cooperate with them for the criminal investigation.
282791	eng	The crime investigators are looking into the murder case.
282792	eng	The crime rate is increasing in this country.
282793	eng	The crime rate is rising steadily.
282794	eng	The criminal was arrested by the police.
282795	eng	The criminals have all been apprehended.
282796	eng	The criminal and his companions ran away while we took our eyes off.
282797	eng	The criminal is not Bob, but his twin brother.

282807	eng	The prisoner escaped under cover of night.
282808	eng	The criminal came out of the house with arms raised.
282809	eng	It's totally without precedent for the suspect's attorney to be the true culprit.
282810	eng	You must realize that prosperity does not last forever.
282811	eng	Prosperity depends on hard work.
282812	eng	Please tell me which bus to take to go downtown.
282813	eng	We wandered aimlessly around the shopping district.
282814	eng	Extra special treatment is imperative to get the vessel through government red tape, so that she can leave port on time.
282815	eng	The entire sales staff has worked around the clock for a week.
282816	eng	The sales plan allows of no alteration.
282817	eng	The meeting on sales promotion is dragging on.
282818	eng	Accessories were laid out on the shelf for sale.
282819	eng	We are writing to inform you that Mr Koichi Ohara has been appointed as Manager of the Technical Department in succession to Mr Taro Iida.
282820	eng	It may snow in the evening.
282821	eng	Dinner is ready, Father.
282822	eng	A dinner will be given next Saturday.
282823	eng	There's no point in hiring a babysitter for the evening.
282824	eng	It may well rain before tonight.
282825	eng	The trend towards late marriage is going to increase more and more.
282826	eng	It is not proper to be late for a dinner party.
282827	eng	At the dinner party he insisted on my making a speech.
282828	eng	I want to mention the release of our new software edition at the banquet.
282829	eng	Late in life the miser learned to be generous with money.
282830	eng	I'll stand you a dinner.
282833	eng	The number is 932-8647, but I don't know the area code.
282834	eng	You seem to have the wrong number.
282835	eng	You've got the wrong number.
282836	eng	I'm afraid you have got the wrong number.
282837	eng	I think you have the wrong number.
282839	eng	I am afraid you have the wrong number.
282840	eng	None of the programs look interesting to me.
282841	eng	Certain parts of the show have been toned down to make it suitable for a family audience.
282842	eng	The program starts at nine o'clock.
282843	eng	The program will finish with the national anthem.
282844	eng	He is above all meanness.
282846	eng	Too much humility is pride.
282847	eng	Don't be a dog.
282848	eng	In the country, the colors of the sky and of the foliage are entirely different from those seen in the city.
282849	eng	He was not of an age but for all time.
282850	eng	He is into the Internet.
282851	eng	He, and he alone, must go.
282852	eng	Isn't he gorgeous? - So tall and smart-looking.
282853	eng	He recently had the bad luck to incur his boss' wrath and got sent out to work in the boondocks.
282854	eng	He said he dashed this proposal off in one sitting. It's pretty sloppy.
282855	eng	He'll never show it, but I think that deep down, he's seriously worried.
282856	eng	He's unstoppable right now but the question is how long he can remain at the pinnacle of his career.
282857	eng	He seems really depressed and lifeless today. I wonder what took the wind out of his sails.
282858	eng	I feel like he's grown cold toward me lately.
282860	eng	He has a lot of confidence.
282861	eng	I hope he will not let us down again by being late.
282862	eng	His boosterism makes it sound wonderful but I wonder if he understands how hard it's going to be to actually carry out.
282863	eng	He cannot have done it by himself.
282864	eng	He was so healthy up to the minute of his sudden death. You really never know what might happen next.
282865	eng	He was so vigorous in making love that his companion for the evening went down for the count.
282866	eng	He may well be proud of his father.
282867	eng	It is strange that he should have done such a thing.
282868	eng	He is Mr Brown, chairman of the committee.
282869	eng	He gave me whatever help I needed.
282870	eng	Everybody suspected him of taking a bribe.
282871	eng	When he said "water," she gave him water.
282872	eng	It's amazing that he won the championship at the age of nineteen.
282873	eng	I had him pegged for a one-rounder at most.
282874	eng	He is unable to finish it in an hour.
282875	eng	I think it wrong that he should go alone.
282877	eng	He can't be under thirty.
282878	eng	He will call for me about six.
282879	eng	I wish he had gotten a hit in the bottom half of the seventh inning.
282880	eng	If he was to return at seven o'clock, why didn't he?
282881	eng	I did not think he was so timid.
282882	eng	If only he had been there.
282883	eng	He is the owner of the liquor shop.
282884	eng	He has every reason for getting angry with you.
282885	eng	Is he your teacher?
282886	eng	He will go in your place.
282887	eng	If he had given up smoking then, he might not be suffering from such a disease.
282888	eng	I think it's a great pity that he died so young.
282889	eng	Do you think he did the job on his own?
282890	eng	Is he the owner of that car?
282891	eng	Everybody knows that he lost his leg in the war.
282892	eng	He was behaving so stupidly that I couldn't keep my temper.
282893	eng	He made such a long speech that we all got bored.
282894	eng	He walked so fast that she couldn't keep up with him.
282895	eng	That he grew up in America is well-known.
282896	eng	It's true that he is in America.
282897	eng	It was because he was injured that he decided to return to America.
282898	eng	It is definite that he will go to America.
282899	eng	I have not heard from him since he left for America.
282900	eng	Have you heard from him since he left for America?
282901	eng	He had not gone though all that hard training for nothing - he won first prize.
282902	eng	If he did not watch so much television, he would have more time for study.
282903	eng	He was clever to leave so early.
282904	eng	It is strange that he should be put up at such a cheap hotel.
282905	eng	That he did such a terrible thing is certain.
282906	eng	It is strange that he should say such a thing.
282907	eng	I can't bear to see him cry like that.
282908	eng	If he were a good pitcher, we would win this game.
282909	eng	I arranged that he be admitted to a good hospital.
282910	eng	What he says makes no sense at all.
282911	eng	I have a general idea of what he means.
282912	eng	He suddenly started doing an impression of an announcer and we all cracked up.
282913	eng	What he said about England is true.
282914	eng	I don't understand his reluctance to go.
282916	eng	He is certain to turn up some time.
282918	eng	Please tell me when he'll arrive here.
282919	eng	It is not certain when he came here.
282920	eng	I don't know when he'll come here.
282921	eng	I don't know when he entered the building.
282922	eng	I couldn't figure out where on earth he was heading for.
282923	eng	Whether he will come at all is doubtful.
282924	eng	Don't bother with what he said.
282925	eng	Can you believe what he said?
282926	eng	Now that he has gone, we miss him very much.
282927	eng	I don't know when he returned from France.
282928	eng	I cannot recall when he moved to Boston.
282929	eng	If he keeps drifting aimlessly, his late father will turn over in his grave.
282930	eng	It is not known when he came up to London.
282931	eng	I don't know when he'll come back.
282932	eng	Please check on when he will return.
282933	eng	Ask her when he will come back.
282934	eng	There is no telling when he will show up.
282935	eng	I'm not sure as to when he will turn up.
282936	eng	I don't know for certain when he will arrive.
282937	eng	It will be reported when he is coming to Japan.
282938	eng	I didn't notice when he left the room.
282940	eng	I am not sure when he will be back.
282941	eng	Please tell me when he'll be back.
282942	eng	Do you know when he will come?
282943	eng	I am not sure when he will come.
282944	eng	I cannot tell when he will come, but when he comes, he will do his best.
282947	eng	I do not know for certain when he will come.
282948	eng	Tell me when he will come.
282949	eng	You are doubtless aware of his absence.
282950	eng	Without him, I would be helpless.
282951	eng	It's nice to be rid of him!
282952	eng	It is strange that he should say no.
282954	eng	What he said in his interview makes sense.
282955	eng	He is no more a liar than you are a liar.
282956	eng	He can't have told a lie.
282957	eng	It was obvious that he was lying.
282958	eng	I have never heard him lie.
282959	eng	It occurred to me that he might have told a lie.
282960	eng	He cannot have told a lie.
282961	eng	He never visits us without bringing some presents for my children.
282962	eng	She took advantage of his confusion to escape.
282963	eng	It is fact that he wants to visit Egypt.
282964	eng	He said he would keep from chatting.
282965	eng	He attended the meeting for his father.
282966	eng	He is impatient to see you.
282967	eng	The court found him guilty of stealing money.
282968	eng	The more he flatters, the less I like him.
282970	eng	It's natural for him to get mad.
282971	eng	He broke out into rage.
282972	eng	I caught him cheating in the examination.
282973	eng	I'll give him your message when he comes.
282974	eng	We will begin the party when he comes.
282975	eng	I will go when he comes back.
282976	eng	I was writing a letter when he came.
282977	eng	I will start after he comes.
282978	eng	Let's begin the discussion after he comes.
282979	eng	He cannot have been there yesterday.
282980	eng	Don't count on him to lend you any money.
282981	eng	There is no persuading him to join the club.
282982	eng	It makes no difference to me whether he comes or not.
282983	eng	It is of no consequence to me that he is coming.
282984	eng	I expect him to come.
282985	eng	Until he comes, I cannot go away.
282986	eng	I wonder where to hang the picture he gave me.
282987	eng	He was accredited with these words.
282988	eng	It is a pity that he should miss such a chance.
282989	eng	I'm disappointed that he's not here.
282991	eng	I wish he were here.
282992	eng	It is strange that he is not here. He always comes at this time.
282993	eng	Don't you think it strange that he is not here?
282994	eng	When he was here, he would swim in the morning.
282995	eng	Let's suppose that he is here.
282996	eng	I'll tell him so when he comes here.
282997	eng	Would that he were here to help us.
282999	eng	I want to know if he'll come here.
283000	eng	I believe that he comes here.
283001	eng	I will go out if he comes here.
283002	eng	That he comes here is surprising.
283003	eng	It is certain that he will come here.
283004	eng	I don't know when he'll be here.
283006	eng	A year has passed since he came here.
283007	eng	Hard work has carried him this far.
283008	eng	I observed him come along here.
283009	eng	In case he gives me a phone call, tell him that I will call him back.
283011	eng	I saw him come this way.
283013	eng	It is surprising that he should not know this.
283014	eng	He is the master of this house.
283015	eng	He should be promoted in the light of what he has done for this company.
283016	eng	I must bring home the fact that he is wrong in this case.
283018	eng	It is true that he accepted this job.
283019	eng	It'll take him two days to finish this work.
283020	eng	The time will come when he will regret this.
283021	eng	I don't have the remotest idea what he will do next.
283022	eng	It is easy for him to answer this question.
283023	eng	How long did it take him to write this novel?
283024	eng	He laid out this garden.
283025	eng	He must have entered this room.
283026	eng	I often see him taking a walk in this neighborhood.
283027	eng	It is said that he wrote this book.
283028	eng	He can't have read this book.
283029	eng	It is true that he is good at playing golf.
283030	eng	He can't have written this; it's not his handwriting.
283031	eng	He was heard to sing at the concert.
283032	eng	It is odd that he is so late.
283033	eng	I thought it strange that he should be up so late.
283034	eng	That he should behave like this!
283035	eng	I stayed so he wouldn't feel lonely.
283036	eng	It was impolite of him not to say goodbye.
283037	eng	I know that he'll call with another price increase.
283038	eng	I never saw him in jeans.
283039	eng	It'll be a pity if he fails.
283040	eng	The wind he gave off smells.
283041	eng	What he did was nothing less than madness.
283042	eng	He comes back from Sydney today.
283043	eng	It was natural for him to be familiar with jazz.
283044	eng	It took him several weeks to recover from the shock.
283045	eng	I suggested that he go there at once.
283046	eng	There is no hope of his getting well soon.
283047	eng	I do hope that he will get well soon.
283048	eng	There is no hope that he will come soon.
283049	eng	It will be a long time before he has fully recovered.
283050	eng	Seeing that he's not preparing at all, it seems that he's not planning to take the exam.
283051	eng	It is funny for him to say so.
283052	eng	It is quite common for him to say so.
283053	eng	He cannot have said so.
283054	eng	He did it not for me but for himself.
283055	eng	It was impolite of him to do so.
283056	eng	He had every reason for doing so.
283057	eng	He does so not because he hates you, but because he loves you.
283059	eng	Since he says so, it must be true.
283060	eng	It is a marvel that he should say so.
283061	eng	What he said is true.
283062	eng	It's quite natural for him to think so.
283063	eng	That he should think so is quite natural.
283064	eng	It is quite natural that he think so.
283065	eng	Small wonder that he thinks so.
283066	eng	What he said there was surprisingly difficult.
283067	eng	Had he been there, he would have told you to mind your manners.
283068	eng	He may be there.
283069	eng	I was surprised to see him there.
283070	eng	He has his reasons for staying there.
283071	eng	His decision to stay there was a surprise to all of us.
283072	eng	It will be dark by the time he gets there.
283073	eng	See to it that he does not go there.
283074	eng	I think it necessary for him to go there.
283075	eng	It was yesterday that he went there.
283076	eng	It was clear that he went there.
283077	eng	It is strange that he should not tell me anything about it.
283079	eng	It will take some time before he understands it.
283080	eng	He had the role of narrating the television drama.
283081	eng	If he had attended the party, they would have been encouraged.
283082	eng	It is not rare for him to make such a mistake.
283083	eng	As he entered the house, two things caught his eye.
283084	eng	What was his motive for setting the house on fire?
283085	eng	He decided not to buy the house, because in the first place it was too expensive, and in the second place it was too far from his office.
283086	eng	He was heard singing the song.
283087	eng	He may well respect the artist.
283088	eng	It is strange that he should not have attended the meeting.
283089	eng	He made the company what it is today.
283090	eng	He has made the company what it is today.
283091	eng	He is the man who drew the picture.
283092	eng	He is in charge of the class.
283093	eng	It occurred to me that he must have lost the money.
283094	eng	The fact remains that he accepted the money.
283095	eng	He has good reason to be against the plan.
283096	eng	It is easy for him to carry out the plan.
283097	eng	He was wrong to go ahead with the plan.
283098	eng	He made up for the deficit.
283099	eng	He made the ultimate decision.
283100	eng	It goes without saying that he's the best person for the job.
283101	eng	He can't have done the work for himself.
283102	eng	If he doesn't accept the job, some other person will.
283103	eng	The reason why he should resign his job is that he is not equal to it.
283104	eng	It took him a week to finish the work.
283105	eng	It will take him two hours to finish the work.
283106	eng	Nobody believed he stood a chance of winning the match.
283107	eng	It is strange that he should have lost the game.
283108	eng	It is strange that he knows nothing about the matter.
283109	eng	He cannot have said that.
283110	eng	I think there is little probability of his succeeding in the enterprise.
283111	eng	His complete ignorance of the accident surprised me.
283112	eng	Can it be true that he has denied that fact?
283113	eng	He was responsible for the car accident.
283114	eng	It occurred to me that he must have stolen the dictionary.
283115	eng	He designed the car.
283116	eng	Whether he wrote the novel or not is not known.
283117	eng	He designed the new building.
283118	eng	It is strange that he should have refused the offer.
283120	eng	It is possible for him to swim across the river.
283121	eng	He assumed full responsibility for it.
283122	eng	His acceptance of the present was regarded as bribery.
283123	eng	It was natural that he should win the contest.
283124	eng	It will take him at least two years to be qualified for that post.
283125	eng	This is the hut in which he lived.
283126	eng	None of us knew his decision to win the long-distance race.
283127	eng	It must be easy for him to find the way.
283128	eng	It is certain that he didn't go out that day.
283129	eng	We know nothing except that he did not come home that day.
283130	eng	It cost him ten dollars to get the ticket.
283131	eng	I have the impression that he knows the secret.
283132	eng	The marvel is that he succeeded in the adventure.
283134	eng	It is difficult for him to solve the problem.
283136	eng	We besought that he might give us the medicine.
283137	eng	It is natural that he should refuse that request.
283138	eng	He made up the story.
283140	eng	He was wise not to participate in it.
283141	eng	The moment he touched it, it blew up.
283142	eng	I can't believe that he is that depressed.
283143	eng	For him to finish it in a day would be impossible.
283144	eng	He can not have done that.
283145	eng	The time when he did it was not known.
283146	eng	It is entirely up to him whether he does it or not.
283147	eng	It is impossible for him to do it.
283148	eng	It is evident that he did it.
283149	eng	The fact that he did not do it cannot be denied.
283150	eng	It is impossible for him to finish it in an hour.
283151	eng	It is impossible for him to do it in a day.
283152	eng	He can't have solved it.
283153	eng	I don't care whether he'll lend it to me or not.
283154	eng	Whether he wrote it or not will always remain a secret.
283156	eng	It was obvious to all that he meant it.
283157	eng	By the time he was ready to cut his eye-teeth his parents were already dead.
283158	eng	When he gets up on stage to sing one of his out-of-tune solos, I get so nervous for him that I get sweaty palms.
283159	eng	I think it quite strange that he should not know such a thing.
283160	eng	He cannot have done such a thing.
283161	eng	It is inconceivable to me that he would do such a thing.
283162	eng	He may well get scolded for doing that.
283163	eng	I can't fancy his saying that.
283164	eng	It is strange that he should say so.
283165	eng	That he should say such a thing!
283167	eng	It is no wonder that he should say such a thing.
283168	eng	Can he have said such a thing?
283171	eng	Can you imagine him driving such a splendid car?
283173	eng	It is a pity that he died so young.
283175	eng	It will be difficult for him to get up so early.
283176	eng	The reason why he came so early is not evident.
283177	eng	It is sad that he has been sick for such a long time.
283178	eng	He must be a good walker to walk such a long distance.
283179	eng	Is there any reason for him to resign so suddenly?
283180	eng	I thought it unusual that he was up so late at night.
283181	eng	He cannot have done such a silly thing.
283182	eng	It is rare that he should make such a mistake.
283183	eng	He cannot have said such an unreasonable thing.
283186	eng	He cannot have said such nonsense.
283187	eng	It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
283188	eng	It was a sight to see him dance.
283189	eng	It is regrettable that he was not elected captain of the team.
283190	eng	When he started to eat his chicken, it tasted a little funny.
283191	eng	He is the very person I was talking of.
283192	eng	If and when he arrives I'll pay.
283193	eng	He came out of the room at last.
283194	eng	Look at him raising his arm in triumph.
283195	eng	The reason why he left the tennis club is obscure.
283196	eng	I don't know if he locked the door.
283197	eng	Nobody could tell what he meant by that.
283198	eng	Do you know what has become of him?
283199	eng	I cannot understand why he left so suddenly.
283200	eng	When he would not give them higher pay, they went on strike.
283201	eng	Do you know why he has been absent from school?
283202	eng	Who knows what has become of him?
283203	eng	Tell me what has become of him.
283204	eng	No one can imagine what has become of him.
283205	eng	I don't know what has become of him.
283206	eng	What do you think has become of him?
283207	eng	I cannot guess at all what is going on with him.
283208	eng	It beats me how he got that money.
283209	eng	No one knows how he has amassed his enormous fortune.
283210	eng	I have no idea how he escaped.
283211	eng	I stepped aside for him to pass.
283212	eng	Do you know where he bought his camera?
283214	eng	No one could tell where he was.
283215	eng	Tell me exactly where he lives.
283217	eng	I have no idea where he lives.
283218	eng	God knows where he fled.
283219	eng	It doesn't matter where he comes from.
283220	eng	I don't know where he comes from.
283221	eng	It is all the same to me where he goes.
283222	eng	Do you know where he went?
283223	eng	I don't know where he went.
283224	eng	I have no idea where he has gone.
283225	eng	There is no way of knowing where he's gone.
283226	eng	God knows where he has gone.
283227	eng	I wish he would make up his mind one way or other.
283228	eng	He looked so funny that I couldn't help laughing.
283229	eng	He told us such a funny story that we all laughed.
283230	eng	I know for certain that he is a man of great importance.
283231	eng	He was naturally very angry.
283232	eng	He told us such funny stories that we all laughed.
283233	eng	Tell me how he got it.
283234	eng	How he escaped still puzzles us.
283235	eng	It is interesting how he learned Japanese cooking.
283236	eng	Isn't there any way to predict how he'll act?
283238	eng	No matter how hard he may study, he cannot master English in a year or two.
283239	eng	Tell me how did he smiled at you.
283240	eng	I don't know what plan he will try.
283241	eng	We can know in advance what excuse he will make.
283242	eng	I don't know what he is like.
283243	eng	I can't figure him out.
283244	eng	It is his laziness that he must overcome.
283245	eng	He hit me, not her.
283246	eng	I can't figure out why he said so.
283247	eng	It is a mystery why he did not finish the poem.
283248	eng	I can't figure out why he did it.
283249	eng	I can't make out why he is so much troubled.
283250	eng	I can't make out why he isn't here yet.
283251	eng	It's obvious why his stomach hurts.
283252	eng	It is a mystery why he quit his job.
283253	eng	Do you know why he put off his departure?
283254	eng	It is still a mystery why he suddenly left the town.
283255	eng	Don't lose your temper whatever he may say.
283256	eng	Don't trust him no matter what he says.
283257	eng	I can hardly make out what he says.
283258	eng	He took charge of the arrangements for the party.
283259	eng	I had been reading a letter when he came in.
283260	eng	The meeting was going off without a hitch until he threw a wet blanket on it by making silly remarks.
283261	eng	He is anything but a fool.
283262	eng	When he came to Tokyo for the first time, this college had not been opened yet.
283263	eng	As soon as he got on the bus, it began to move.
283264	eng	When he arrived at the bus stop, the bus was already out of sight.
283265	eng	He wouldn't be caught dead playing pachinko.
283266	eng	It is two years since he left for Hawaii.
283267	eng	They are investigating the mystery of the universe thoroughly.
283268	eng	If you heard him playing the piano, you would never think he is an eight-year-old boy.
283269	eng	Keep silent while he is playing the piano.
283270	eng	He played the piano and she sang.
283271	eng	She insisted that he play the piano.
283272	eng	He may well get very angry.
283273	eng	He has good reason to get very angry.
283274	eng	He cannot have completed the work by himself.
283275	eng	It is doubtful whether he did his homework by himself.
283276	eng	Everybody thought it strange that he lived alone.
283277	eng	Two months have passed since he left for France.
283278	eng	He went to France not so much for sightseeing as for observation.
283279	eng	If you were to hear him speak French, you would take him for a Frenchman.
283280	eng	He's the new CEO from the parent company in France.
283281	eng	I saw him coming with his briefcase under his arm.
283282	eng	What he said to Beth was nothing less than an insult to her.
283283	eng	I found him lying on the bed.
283284	eng	I took for granted that he got homesick.
283285	eng	I don't like him any more than he likes me.
283286	eng	If he asks, I will give it; if not, not.
283287	eng	I gave him as much food as he wanted.
283288	eng	Don't believe all the stories he's put about.
283289	eng	I can assure you of his earnestness.
283290	eng	He won the race again.
283291	eng	It is very doubtful whether he is still alive.
283292	eng	He hasn't come yet.
283293	eng	He has not come yet. Something may have happened to him.
283294	eng	It is strange that he has not come yet.
283295	eng	No sooner had he struck the match than the bomb exploded.
283296	eng	Did you know he bought a condominium?
283297	eng	It is hardly possible for him not to make any mistake.
283298	eng	I saw him playing cards with all of them.
283299	eng	If he were a little younger, he would be eligible for the post.
283300	eng	If he had been a little more careful, he would have succeeded.
283301	eng	If he had been a little more careful, the accident would have been avoided.
283302	eng	Let's wait here till he comes back.
283303	eng	The news that he brought delighted us.
283304	eng	If he had studied harder, he would have passed the exam.
283305	eng	I wish he would write more often.
283306	eng	The gate had already been closed when he returned.
283307	eng	I'll get the work done by the time he gets back.
283308	eng	When he came, we were having dinner.
283309	eng	It's uncertain if he'll come.
283310	eng	Everything was in order until he came.
283312	eng	It is clear that he is guilty.
283313	eng	Now it would be better to keep a sharp lookout for what he might do.
283314	eng	He thought of a good solution.
283315	eng	It will be some time before he gets well.
283316	eng	It is not probable that he will get well.
283317	eng	My uncle would not have employed him but that he was very energetic.
283318	eng	The horse kicked at him when he approached it.
283319	eng	He didn't live to say another word.
283320	eng	My pride prevented me from borrowing money from him.
283321	eng	It is not good to borrow money from him.
283322	eng	I haven't heard from him for ages.
283323	eng	Do you often hear from him?
283324	eng	We got an unexpected present from him. I guess he felt a little obligated after what we did for him.
283325	eng	I couldn't get a definite answer from him.
283326	eng	I have heard nothing else from him yet.
283327	eng	I have not heard a word from him as yet.
283328	eng	I haven't heard a word from him as yet.
283329	eng	I got a scribbled note from him, but haven't heard from him since.
283331	eng	I have had no news from him yet.
283332	eng	He sent back a message that everyone was well.
283333	eng	I have heard nothing from him for five years.
283335	eng	He was a great influence on me.
283336	eng	I have heard nothing from him.
283337	eng	Months went past without any news from him.
283339	eng	He wrote to me yesterday.
283340	eng	The motorcycle which I borrowed from him broke down.
283341	eng	Have you got a letter from him?
283342	eng	I received an invitation from him, but didn't accept it.
283344	eng	I had a phone call from him.
283345	eng	Have you heard from him?
283346	eng	He proposed to Miss Lee and she accepted.
283347	eng	Is it true that he won the race?
283350	eng	It is not likely that he did it on purpose.
283351	eng	I'm pretty sure he came late on purpose.
283352	eng	He acted as our guide.
283353	eng	I was annoyed with him for interrupting me.
283354	eng	We have to attend to what he tells us.
283355	eng	You are mistaken if you think he is wrong.
283356	eng	Although he was wrong, he didn't say he was sorry.
283357	eng	It is clear that he is a great artist.
283358	eng	The fact that he was a great statesman cannot be denied.
283359	eng	It is impossible for him to become a doctor.
283360	eng	If he had taken his doctor's advice, he might still be alive.
283361	eng	We thought it was in the cards for him to aim to become a doctor.
283362	eng	The town where he was brought up lies east of Osaka.
283363	eng	It makes no difference to me whether he joins us or not.
283364	eng	It wasn't Mary that he went to the museum with.
283365	eng	She would often hear him grumbling to himself.
283366	eng	The fact that he did not accept any money shows that he is an honest man.
283367	eng	It is true that he won first prize.
283369	eng	He is least likely to come.
283370	eng	It is her eldest daughter that he loves most.
283371	eng	He is most likely to succeed.
283372	eng	It is certain that he is the tallest of us all.
283373	eng	I am adamant that he undertake it.
283374	eng	When he retired, his son took over his business.
283375	eng	His decision to retire surprised all of us.
283377	eng	It's obvious that you told a lie.
283378	eng	It is possible that he is telling a lie.
283379	eng	It never occurred to me that he might tell a lie.
283380	eng	He's never told a lie.
283381	eng	I knew all along that he was telling a lie.
283382	eng	He assures us that he didn't attach a false statement.
283383	eng	Are you taking in all he is saying?
283384	eng	The car he's driving is not his.
283385	eng	He seldom, if ever, goes to the movies.
283387	eng	I heard the news of his death with deep regret.
283388	eng	He can no more swim than a hammer can.
283389	eng	To hear him speak English, you would take him for a native speaker.
283390	eng	I often listened to him speak in English.
283391	eng	If he is proficient in English, I'll employ him.
283392	eng	If he were proficient in English, I would hire him.
283393	eng	He can speak French, not to mention English.
283394	eng	Two years have passed since he went over to American in order to study English.
283395	eng	Hearing him speak English, one would take him for an Englishman.
283396	eng	To hear him speak English, you would take him for an Englishman.
283397	eng	To hear him speak English, you would take him for an American.
283398	eng	To hear him speak English, you would mistake him for an Englishman.
283399	eng	To hear him speak English, you would take him for a native.
283401	eng	If he could speak English, I would employ him right away.
283402	eng	The moment he arrived at the station, it began to rain.
283403	eng	When he reached the station, the train had already left almost half an hour before.
283404	eng	When he got to the station, the train had already left.
283405	eng	Were it not for the fact that he is a billionaire, she would never marry him.
283406	eng	His extensive knowledge of music was a revelation to us.
283407	eng	I heard him coming downstairs.
283408	eng	I found him a genius at chemistry.
283409	eng	It is clear that he pretended to be ill.
283410	eng	He never does anything but she smells it out.
283411	eng	He started to say something, but I beat him to it.
283412	eng	We don't care what he does.
283413	eng	Guess what he told me.
283415	eng	Whatever he may say, I won't change my mind.
283416	eng	It is remarkable that he said nothing at all.
283417	eng	What do you think he did?
283418	eng	Do you know what he has done?
283419	eng	It was clear what he meant to do.
283420	eng	It was clear what he was trying to go.
283422	eng	I don't care what he does.
283423	eng	There is no telling what he will do.
283425	eng	I cannot understand what he is driving at.
283426	eng	No matter what he says, don't trust him.
283427	eng	Can you make out what he is trying to say?
283429	eng	No matter what he may say, don't trust him.
283431	eng	Do you know what he said?
283432	eng	It was rather difficult for me to make out what he was saying.
283434	eng	What do you think he has in mind?
283435	eng	There is no telling what he is thinking.
283436	eng	I can't imagine what he is thinking.
283438	eng	I don't know the reason why he will not go on to college.
283439	eng	There is no telling what time he will come.
283440	eng	I'm uncertain what time he is coming.
283443	eng	I don't mind in the slightest who he is.
283444	eng	It is clear that he is at home.
283445	eng	He broke into a house.
283446	eng	I went to market after he came home.
283447	eng	He may well be proud of his house.
283448	eng	He had hardly left home when it began to rain.
283449	eng	As soon as he went out of the house, it began to rain.
283450	eng	His running away from home is due to his father's severity.
283451	eng	It is fact that he ran away from home.
283452	eng	It was after a meeting in America that he decided to write a book for non-scientists.
283453	eng	I never heard him sing.
283454	eng	Can you hear his singing?
283455	eng	I see him singing, but this isn't often.
283456	eng	He sang a song.
283457	eng	He is father to the bride.
283458	eng	He is commander of our troops.
283459	eng	It is certain that he will agree with us.
283460	eng	He deprived us of our liberty.
283461	eng	I expect that he will help us.
283462	eng	Is it certain that he will help us?
283463	eng	I wish he had attended the meeting.
283464	eng	I see no reason why he doesn't relate to the firm.
283465	eng	He persuaded his firm to let him go back to his old job.
283466	eng	Everyone knows that he worked hard to get to the top of the company.
283467	eng	He made a speech on behalf of our company.
283468	eng	There are rumors in the air that he was fired.
283469	eng	It is strange for him to be dismissed.
283470	eng	There is no reason why he should be dismissed.
283471	eng	There is little if any hope for his recovery.
283472	eng	I had hoped that he would recover.
283473	eng	Is there any chance of his recovery?
283474	eng	Is there any prospect of his recovering?
283475	eng	There is little hope of his recovery.
283476	eng	There is little, if any, hope of his recovery.
283477	eng	It's even chances that he will get well.
283478	eng	There is no hope of his recovery.
283479	eng	It is this window that he broke.
283480	eng	I am suspicious of him.
283481	eng	It's true that he saw a monster.
283482	eng	I can hardly imagine him going abroad.
283484	eng	Just because he likes painting, it doesn't follow he knows how to paint.
283485	eng	I helped him out with his picture.
283486	eng	It was not until he was forty that he started to paint pictures.
283487	eng	We heard him come downstairs.
283488	eng	I heard him go down the stairs.
283489	eng	Did you see him go out?
283490	eng	He is in charge of entertaining the foreign guests.
283491	eng	He argued that nuclear weapons were a threat to peace.
283492	eng	He found that the things he had studied in school were not useful in the business world.
283493	eng	He can not have gone to school.
283494	eng	He can't have gone to school.
283495	eng	It is only natural that he should do well at school.
283496	eng	It is because his mother is ill that he cannot come to school.
283497	eng	It is strange for him to be absent from school.
283498	eng	It is for this reason that he left school.
283499	eng	It is by this reason that he left school.
283500	eng	It's such a long time since he left school.
283501	eng	He is anything but a scholar.
283502	eng	It was a glass that he broke.
283503	eng	The vase broken by him is my aunt's.
283504	eng	Little did I imagine he would achieve a perfect game.
283505	eng	He is the minister responsible for the environment.
283506	eng	It is plain that he is wrong.
283507	eng	It is certain that he is wrong.
283508	eng	It's obvious that he's in the wrong.
283509	eng	Look at the book which he put on the desk.
283510	eng	I remember the time when he returned.
283511	eng	He came back not because he was homesick, but because he was running short of money.
283512	eng	Will you tell him about it when he comes home?
283513	eng	As soon as he comes back, let me know.
283514	eng	Let's start after he comes home.
283515	eng	Please wait till he comes back.
283516	eng	Let's leave things as they are until he comes back.
283517	eng	I'll wait here till he comes back.
283518	eng	It will have stopped raining by the time he comes back.
283519	eng	He came back, and it rained soon.
283520	eng	Let's leave as soon as he gets back.
283522	eng	When he was leaving, he told me that he would come again by the 25th.
283523	eng	It was because he was ill that he decided to return home.
283524	eng	It was because he was sick that he decided to return home.
283525	eng	The sun had already set when he got home.
283526	eng	I was just going to write a letter when he came home.
283527	eng	I suggested to her that we go to the movies after he came home.
283528	eng	Upon returning home, he found a letter in the mailbox.
283529	eng	When he came to, he was lying in the park.
283532	eng	I didn't tell him the truth for fear he would get angry.
283533	eng	It is best that he should do his duty.
283534	eng	He was elected chairman.
283535	eng	His absence was due to illness.
283536	eng	The reason he was absent was that he had a severe headache.
283537	eng	Now that he is absent, I will have to work in his place.
283538	eng	I was pleased with the rapidity with which he mastered Japanese.
283539	eng	After he left, she started feeling uneasy.
283540	eng	I stayed there until he had left.
283541	eng	When he shouted, the veins in his neck stood out clearly.
283542	eng	His threat got me to start studying seriously.
283543	eng	To his surprise, the train made a quick stop.
283544	eng	To his amazement, the door opened all by itself.
283545	eng	To his surprise, the thief turned out to be his own son.
283546	eng	He was right to give up smoking.
283547	eng	I have a feeling that he may blow in sometime soon.
283548	eng	He moved into my neighborhood.
283549	eng	We cried banzai at the news that he won the gold medal.
283550	eng	We congratulated him on winning a gold medal.
283551	eng	Some new books were added to the library at his expense.
283552	eng	I caught him stealing the money.
283553	eng	It's clear that he stole money from the safe.
283554	eng	Because he is rich, it doesn't follow that he is happy.
283555	eng	I never counted on his being rich.
283556	eng	It is clear that he is rich.
283557	eng	The police suspect that he robbed the bank.
283558	eng	Whatever he asks you, you mustn't answer.
283559	eng	Were he to see you, he would be surprised.
283560	eng	He cannot have told you a wrong number.
283562	eng	It is certain that he will agree to your plan.
283563	eng	I bet that he'll accept your proposal.
283564	eng	No wonder he refused your offer.
283565	eng	The reason he refused your offer is obvious.
283566	eng	Don't you know he is enraged at your insult?
283567	eng	It came out that what he had told the police was not true.
283568	eng	I can't account for his absence.
283569	eng	I am impatient with his inability to make decisions.
283570	eng	I am convinced that he is innocent.
283571	eng	It's just possible that he'll eventually recover the use of his legs.
283572	eng	It is not you but her that he wants to marry.
283573	eng	The woman whom he married is very beautiful.
283574	eng	How did you know that he is married?
283575	eng	They have been married for ten years.
283576	eng	His good health is attributed to getting plenty of sleep.
283577	eng	It was a miracle that he recovered.
283578	eng	He was seen to enter the building.
283579	eng	The box he found was empty.
283580	eng	I'm sure that he is clever.
283581	eng	It is not clear whether he is wise or not.
283582	eng	I am no more intelligent than he.
283583	eng	When he went out the front door, the bus was just coming around the corner.
283584	eng	When he turned up, we had been waiting for two hours.
283585	eng	We were talking about him when he appeared.
283586	eng	His appearance animated the party.
283587	eng	There was an awkward silence when he appeared.
283588	eng	I have no idea where he is at present.
283589	eng	I think it's true that he wasn't at the scene.
283591	eng	All that he says is true.
283592	eng	Whatever he says is true.
283593	eng	What he says is false.
283594	eng	What he says is very important.
283595	eng	Admitting what he says, I still think that he is in the wrong.
283596	eng	Few students could understand what he said.
283597	eng	He says firefighting is a feast or famine job.
283599	eng	What he said turned out to be false.
283600	eng	What he said cannot be true.
283601	eng	Don't take any notice of what he said.
283602	eng	Some of the things he said got under my skin.
283603	eng	Gradually the true meaning of what he said began to dawn on me.
283604	eng	What he said may well be true.
283605	eng	What he said is, in a sense, true.
283607	eng	What he said was by no means true.
283608	eng	What he said then shocked me.
283609	eng	What he said is not true.
283612	eng	What he said counts for nothing.
283613	eng	What he has said is true of them.
283615	eng	What he said turned out to be true.
283617	eng	Do tell me what he said.
283618	eng	Do you believe what he said?
283619	eng	I remember what he said.
283620	eng	Only a few understood what he said.
283621	eng	Everything he said was right.
283622	eng	What he said was to the contrary.
283623	eng	I got the gist of what he was saying.
283624	eng	What he is saying doesn't make sense.
283625	eng	What he says sounds very sensible to me.
283627	eng	He was heard to shut the door behind him.
283628	eng	It is evident that he has made a mistake.
283629	eng	I like him.
283630	eng	I understand him to be happy.
283631	eng	I know quite clearly what he thinks.
283632	eng	It is Egypt that he wants to visit.
283633	eng	The dog followed him wherever he went.
283634	eng	It is advisable for him to go.
283635	eng	It is definite that he will go.
283636	eng	I don't care whether he leaves or stays.
283637	eng	His success delighted his parents.
283638	eng	It is doubtful whether he will pass.
283639	eng	I would like to have seen him before he left the country.
283640	eng	He hasn't been heard from since he left the country.
283641	eng	I copied in my notebook whatever he wrote on the blackboard.
283642	eng	I wish he were here now.
283643	eng	I know nothing as to where he is now.
283644	eng	Make certain where he is now.
283645	eng	We are worried about where he is now.
283646	eng	It is certain that he is in Hawaii now.
283647	eng	Where he will live doesn't interest us.
283648	eng	We were surprised when we saw him in the office this morning.
283649	eng	I am uncertain when he will come next.
283650	eng	I don't know if he will visit us next Sunday.
283651	eng	You should read such a good book as he is reading now.
283652	eng	Sport has made him what he is.
283653	eng	What he is today he owes to his father.
283655	eng	I don't know the reason he is absent today.
283656	eng	Do you know the reason why he cut class today?
283657	eng	It is no laughing matter that he couldn't graduate from university this year.
283658	eng	The dinner he ate this evening was inferior in quality to that dinner.
283659	eng	His reelection seems sure.
283660	eng	What he needs most is a good job.
283661	eng	It serves him right that he missed the last train.
283662	eng	He was the first to arrive.
283663	eng	He was the first person to arrive.
283664	eng	He was the first to come.
283665	eng	His boast that he is the best pitcher is true.
283666	eng	There is no doubt about his ability.
283667	eng	There is no room to doubt that he is a gifted artist.
283668	eng	I must make sure whether he is at home or not.
283669	eng	The model plane they built was fragile.
283671	eng	The fish he caught yesterday is still alive.
283672	eng	He came to see you yesterday.
283673	eng	What he said yesterday is not consistent with what he had said last week.
283674	eng	What he said yesterday is not true.
283675	eng	What he told me yesterday is a white lie.
283676	eng	It is doubtless that he was murdered.
283677	eng	I read in the newspaper that he had been murdered.
283678	eng	The number of prey they killed was the same.
283679	eng	Whether he agrees or not, we won't change our plans.
283680	eng	He fell in with a strange man when he was taking a walk.
283681	eng	It doesn't matter whether he agrees or not.
283682	eng	It makes no difference whether he agrees or not.
283683	eng	It is uncertain whether he will agree or not.
283684	eng	I don't care whether he agrees or not.
283685	eng	I am certain that he will quit his job.
283686	eng	He has every reason to quit his job.
283688	eng	There must be something wrong with the pen he is using.
283689	eng	His constant complaints aroused my rage.
283690	eng	I thought it strange that he didn't turn up.
283691	eng	He is certain to turn up.
283692	eng	Let's wait here until he turns up.
283693	eng	I've known him ever since he was a child.
283695	eng	He is actually not the manager.
283696	eng	The estate went to his daughter when he died.
283697	eng	What will become of the children after his death?
283698	eng	The news of his death spread abroad.
283700	eng	I was surprised at the news of his death.
283701	eng	It was yesterday that he died.
283702	eng	It is a great pity he was given up for lost.
283704	eng	The evening he died was stormy.
283705	eng	He has been dead for three years.
283706	eng	It has been ten years since he died.
283707	eng	She still hated him, even after he died.
283708	eng	Ten years have passed since he died.
283709	eng	With his death, the oldest family in this village died out.
283710	eng	He has been dead for five years.
283711	eng	Three years have passed since he died.
283712	eng	Either he or I am to attend the meeting.
283713	eng	I don't know whether he'll join us or not.
283715	eng	I wish he were on our team.
283717	eng	That he refused our proposal was big surprise to us.
283718	eng	If only he would marry me!
283719	eng	It is surprising that he should have said such things of me.
283720	eng	It never occurred to me that he might insist on treating me to dinner.
283721	eng	I wonder what he promised to do for me.
283722	eng	I hope he will see me and listen to my future plans.
283723	eng	What he told me proved true.
283724	eng	He is the chief of my department.
283726	eng	Either he is to blame, or I am.
283727	eng	He is wrong or I am.
283728	eng	Either he or I have to attend the convention.
283729	eng	Whether he agrees to my opinion or not, I will do the work.
283730	eng	He has my fate in his hands.
283731	eng	What he finds in my face I can't guess.
283732	eng	He's charging me roughly four times as much as he charged when he started cutting my lawn.
283733	eng	I think it doubtful whether he understood my explanation.
283734	eng	He went in place of me.
283735	eng	It is necessary that he follow my advice.
283736	eng	If he had taken my advice, he would now be rich.
283737	eng	I think it was a mistake that you didn't take my advice.
283738	eng	I don't know whether he's younger or older than I am.
283739	eng	He went into the water before me.
283740	eng	It never occurred to me that he loved me.
283742	eng	It is not likely that he did it on purpose to deceive me.
283743	eng	I felt like hitting him when he tried to cheat me.
283744	eng	He chose to have me stay.
283745	eng	I was surprised because he lifted me up with ease.
283746	eng	I saw him looking at me.
283748	eng	I know he is watching me.
283750	eng	It has dawned upon me that he does not like me.
283751	eng	He came to my rescue.
283752	eng	I began to understand the reason why he hated me.
283753	eng	I expected that he would visit me.
283755	eng	It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
283756	eng	I don't know whether he will agree to our plan or not.
283757	eng	It is true that he got full marks on the test.
283758	eng	It is no wonder that he passed the examination.
283759	eng	That he passed the exam is surprising to us.
283760	eng	I was pleased to hear that he had succeeded in the examination.
283761	eng	I'm glad that he passed the exam.
283762	eng	It is certain that he passed the examination.
283763	eng	I take it for granted that he will succeed in the examination.
283764	eng	I was informed of his failure in the examination.
283765	eng	It was a bitter disappointment to him when he failed his examination.
283766	eng	Never did I expect that he would fail the examination.
283767	eng	It is certain that he will pass the examination.
283768	eng	I can't ensure that he will pass the examination.
283769	eng	Is it any wonder that he failed in the examination?
283770	eng	His failing the test is no laughing matter.
283771	eng	It is truly regrettable that he failed the examination.
283772	eng	It'll serve him right if he fails the exam; he doesn't study at all.
283773	eng	He is certain to win the game.
283774	eng	It was pure chance that he won the game.
283776	eng	The dog who he kept sometimes barked at strangers.
283777	eng	No wonder that he has failed in the enterprise.
283778	eng	It is not because he had a faculty for business but because he was lucky that he succeeded in business.
283779	eng	It was fortunate that he was taken to a nearby hospital right away after the accident.
283780	eng	I accept that he was telling the truth.
283781	eng	He is the president of the company in fact.
283782	eng	I question whether he'll come in time.
283783	eng	I doubt if he will come on time.
283784	eng	If only he arrives in time!
283785	eng	You can rely upon his being punctual.
283786	eng	You cannot calculate on his punctuality.
283787	eng	There is not much possibility of his coming on time.
283788	eng	What he did next was quite a surprise to me.
283789	eng	There is no knowing what he will do next.
283790	eng	His next two books were novels.
283791	eng	He was passing by on his bicycle when he heard a cry for help.
283792	eng	It took him three months to learn to ride a bicycle.
283793	eng	I am very much surprised to hear that he got badly injured in a motorcar accident.
283794	eng	He can't possibly write the letter by himself.
283795	eng	There is a picture of his own painting.
283796	eng	The woman who he thought was his aunt was a stranger.
283797	eng	That was all he needed to operate his computer.
283798	eng	It looked almost impossible for him to finish his book.
283799	eng	He may well be proud of his daughter.
283801	eng	It is certain that he helped them for the benefit of himself.
283802	eng	There is a rumor that he has resigned.
283803	eng	There is no reason why he should resign.
283804	eng	There are rumors that he will resign.
283805	eng	There is a rumor about that he is going to resign.
283807	eng	I didn't know he had decided to leave his job.
283808	eng	It is not surprising that he resigned.
283809	eng	Because he was unemployed, their wedlock failed.
283810	eng	I was surprised that he had failed.
283812	eng	It is no wonder that he failed.
283813	eng	His failure was due to his idleness.
283814	eng	It is no wonder that he has failed.
283815	eng	I am afraid he will make a mistake.
283816	eng	That he will fail is certain.
283817	eng	It is hardly conceivable to me that he will fail.
283818	eng	I expect him to get over the shock of his failure.
283819	eng	The ease with which he answered the question surprised us.
283820	eng	I found it impossible to explain what he is really like.
283821	eng	The photo he showed added color to his story.
283823	eng	He was about to apologize when the man punched him in the face.
283824	eng	He kindly drove me to the station.
283825	eng	His car was seriously damaged when he backed into a telephone pole.
283826	eng	He may well be proud of his car.
283827	eng	Someone saw him wash his car.
283828	eng	I saw him wash the car.
283829	eng	He guaranteed my debt.
283830	eng	We must take into account the fact that he is young.
283831	eng	You had better take his youth into account.
283832	eng	He was an early riser in his youth.
283833	eng	Whether he has the operation depends upon the availability of the organ.
283834	eng	It has slowly dawned upon us that he will not help.
283835	eng	Tell me the reason why he was fired.
283836	eng	Is there any possibility of his resigning?
283837	eng	I am positive that he has finished.
283839	eng	The place where he lives is far from town.
283840	eng	There were no flowers or trees on his street.
283841	eng	Do you know the town where he lives?
283842	eng	Would you see to it that they get properly fed?
283843	eng	He played an important part.
283844	eng	As soon as he went out, it began to rain.
283845	eng	It began to rain when he went out.
283846	eng	His primary reason for going out was to see Patty.
283847	eng	I heard him go out.
283848	eng	As soon as he left, the bank closed.
283849	eng	His departure means that there will be peace in the house.
283850	eng	Three and a half hours have passed since he left.
283851	eng	The medicine he had prescribed failed to take effect.
283852	eng	It was ten years ago that he first came to Japan.
283853	eng	His oral agreement may not mean anything without his signed contract.
283854	eng	The novels he wrote are interesting.
283855	eng	Had it not been for his help, I couldn't have finished the report.
283856	eng	She would have failed but for his help.
283857	eng	I don't doubt that he will help me.
283858	eng	We took it for granted that he would help us.
283859	eng	On few occasions was he willing to ask for any help.
283860	eng	I'm always surprised at the way he talks to girls.
283861	eng	It looks like he's winning.
283862	eng	I'll bet 10,000 yen on his winning.
283863	eng	There is a good chance that he will win.
283864	eng	There is little chance of his winning.
283865	eng	Whether he will be offered the scholarship or not is still in the air.
283866	eng	His writing of a novel surprised us.
283867	eng	I'm satisfied if he has become any wiser.
283868	eng	I took it for granted that he would consent.
283869	eng	When he smiled, the children saw his long, gray teeth.
283870	eng	You mustn't despise him because he didn't win a prize.
283871	eng	His jumbo jet ought to have arrived in Osaka now.
283872	eng	When does his train arrive at Kyoto?
283873	eng	It is important for him to get the job.
283874	eng	Never have I heard him complaining about his meals.
283875	eng	He said he would pay for the dinner.
283876	eng	I can assure you of his reliability.
283878	eng	I was on the spot when he had a heart attack.
283879	eng	I hope he will succeed in his new position.
283881	eng	He is a new addition to the teaching staff.
283882	eng	To me he's no different from a million other dull middle aged men.
283883	eng	While he was reading a newspaper, his dog was lying beside him.
283885	eng	He can't know the truth.
283886	eng	It is true that he stole the pearl.
283887	eng	It is true that he couldn't know the truth.
283888	eng	He is anything but a gentleman.
283889	eng	I like him not because he is kind but because he is honest.
283890	eng	He thoughtfully gave me a helping hand.
283891	eng	You shouldn't let him get away with cheating.
283892	eng	That he is a man of character cannot be denied.
283893	eng	I doubt that he can make a speech in public.
283894	eng	No one in the neighborhood believed him to be a genius even after he had achieved world-wide fame.
283895	eng	The news that he had succeeded delighted them.
283896	eng	He has succeeded by virtue of his constant efforts rather than his talent.
283897	eng	He succeeded, not because he made efforts, but because he happened to be lucky.
283898	eng	His success is the result of hard work.
283899	eng	It is through hard work that he succeeded, not through good luck.
283900	eng	He owes his success to good luck.
283901	eng	I have not succeeded just because I worked hard.
283902	eng	He owes his success only to good luck.
283903	eng	It's natural that he should have succeeded.
283904	eng	He owed his success to both ability and industry.
283905	eng	It is no wonder that he has succeeded.
283907	eng	Never did I dream that he would succeed.
283908	eng	Whether he will succeed or not depends upon his health.
283909	eng	His success depends on his efforts.
283910	eng	There is little doubt as to whether he will succeed or not.
283912	eng	Whether he will succeed or not depends on his efforts.
283913	eng	It is certain that he will succeed.
283914	eng	I hope that he will succeed.
283915	eng	That he will succeed is certain.
283916	eng	Who can guarantee his success?
283917	eng	He couldn't possibly succeed.
283919	eng	Let's help him so that he will succeed.
283920	eng	There is little, if any, possibility of his success.
283921	eng	There was a strong likelihood of his succeeding.
283922	eng	There is little hope of his success.
283923	eng	There is very little hope of his success.
283924	eng	There isn't any hope of his success.
283925	eng	I led him to expect success.
283926	eng	We have some doubt as to whether he has chosen the right course.
283927	eng	I admit that he is right.
283928	eng	I am of the opinion that he is right.
283929	eng	I don't know exactly when he will arrive.
283930	eng	I doubt if he is honest.
283931	eng	We cannot gainsay that he is honest.
283932	eng	I will answer for his honesty.
283933	eng	There are sufficient grounds for believing he is honest.
283934	eng	How can we be sure of his honesty?
283935	eng	I found him honest.
283936	eng	There is no doubt that he is honest.
283937	eng	His honesty is beyond doubt.
283938	eng	Admitting that he is honest, I doubt his ability.
283939	eng	I would never question his honesty.
283941	eng	Granted that he is honest, but I doubt his ability.
283942	eng	We respect him all the more for his honesty.
283943	eng	I am proud of his honesty.
283944	eng	Her honesty is beyond question.
283945	eng	I answer for his honesty.
283946	eng	I answer for his honesty, for I know him well.
283948	eng	He can't be an honest man.
283949	eng	There is no way to confirm that he is alive.
283950	eng	That he is alive is certain.
283951	eng	I was relieved to hear that he was alive.
283952	eng	I don't know whether he is dead or alive.
283953	eng	There is no hope of his being alive.
283954	eng	There is little, if any, hope of his being alive.
283955	eng	That he survived was remarkable.
283956	eng	It was in 1950 that he was born.
283957	eng	The village in which he was born is far from here.
283958	eng	It snowed heavily in the morning he was born.
283959	eng	Where was he born and raised?
283960	eng	He brings home the bread and butter.
283961	eng	I vouch for his sincerity.
283962	eng	His red face showed his anger.
283963	eng	His constant insults aroused my anger.
283964	eng	The examination he took last week was very hard.
283965	eng	He is the boy of whom I spoke the other day.
283966	eng	He is specializing in the study of economics.
283967	eng	It is apparent that he will win the election.
283968	eng	Is there any possibility that he'll win the election?
283969	eng	There is little hope of his winning the election.
283970	eng	Because he is good, it does not follow that he is wise.
283971	eng	It's unusual for him to get up early.
283972	eng	I believe him to get up early.
283973	eng	Do you think he is the guy that broke the window?
283974	eng	The distance he ran was much greater than had been expected.
283975	eng	I saw him running.
283976	eng	The apples which he sent to me were delicious.
283977	eng	It is only natural that he be proud of his son.
283978	eng	He's every reason to be proud of his son.
283979	eng	He is justly proud of his son.
283980	eng	It's not surprising that he be proud of his son.
283981	eng	He may well be proud of his sons.
283982	eng	I've never heard him speak ill of others.
283983	eng	He batted three runners home.
283984	eng	I cannot help his being lazy.
283985	eng	His colleagues gave him a present when he retired.
283986	eng	No wonder he was arrested.
283987	eng	It is clear that he has made a big mistake.
283988	eng	He acted like he owned the place.
283989	eng	The bigger words he used, the harder it was to find anything inside of them.
283990	eng	His mother's prophecy that he would be a great musician was later fulfilled.
283991	eng	I don't know whether he's a college student or not.
283992	eng	I really like him!
283993	eng	To his great joy, his team won the game.
283994	eng	Much to his surprise, he found his dog dead.
283995	eng	It never occurred to me that he was a prison-breaker.
283996	eng	After he bumped into the shelf, the priceless china fell and shattered into fragments.
284002	eng	He sent me a birthday card.
284003	eng	He run fastest by a long chalk.
284004	eng	If only he had known!
284006	eng	I knew that he was trying to use that money to become governor.
284007	eng	His delay made the situation all the worse.
284008	eng	Give him this message the moment he arrives.
284009	eng	I'll give him this message the moment he arrives.
284010	eng	Let's leave as soon as he arrives.
284011	eng	I stepped aside so that he could come in.
284012	eng	That he grew up in China is well-known.
284013	eng	His knowledge of Chinese enables us to carry out our plan smoothly.
284014	eng	I took it for granted that he would become a member.
284015	eng	He intervened and settled the matter peacefully for the time being.
284016	eng	Hardly had he finished breakfast when the telephone rang.
284017	eng	Hardly had he finished breakfast when the doctor came.
284018	eng	He was brilliant in the morning sun.
284019	eng	It was yesterday that I saw him walking down the street.
284020	eng	May he live long!
284022	eng	We saw him walking across the street.
284023	eng	He was seen to cross the street.
284024	eng	We saw him walk across the street.
284025	eng	When he was about to pass, the Sphinx jumped in front of him.
284026	eng	I stepped aside so that he could pass.
284027	eng	The errors apparent in his results are due more to carelessness than faulty procedures.
284028	eng	I couldn't help laughing when I saw him lying face down covered with mud.
284030	eng	The gun went off while he was cleaning it, and the bullet almost struck his wife.
284031	eng	You can easily tell that he is a genius.
284032	eng	That he is a genius is clear to everyone.
284033	eng	It is not too much to say that he is a genius.
284034	eng	I saw him enter the store.
284035	eng	He must have missed the train.
284036	eng	It is certain that he missed the train.
284037	eng	I had been reading a book for some time when he called.
284038	eng	We were in the middle of lunch when he gave me a ring.
284039	eng	Ten years have passed since he went to America.
284040	eng	The crowd cheered when he appeared.
284041	eng	I was annoyed with him for his interruptions.
284042	eng	Naturally he got angry.
284043	eng	I think it natural that he got angry.
284044	eng	No wonder he is so angry.
284046	eng	It is rare for him to get angry.
284047	eng	It is quite natural that he should be angry.
284048	eng	I think it natural for him to get angry.
284049	eng	It's natural for him to get angry.
284050	eng	I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
284051	eng	There's no denying his ability as a pitcher, but he is rather injury-prone.
284052	eng	It is half a year since he went to Tokyo.
284053	eng	On his getting to Tokyo, I'll telephone you.
284054	eng	I think it certain that he went to Tokyo.
284055	eng	No one went to the station to see him off when he left for Tokyo.
284056	eng	Needless to say he is one of the best writers of the present generation.
284057	eng	There was a long interval before he answered.
284058	eng	There was a long interval before he replied.
284059	eng	The train will have started by the time he arrives.
284060	eng	No sooner had he arrived than the bus departed.
284061	eng	Let me know when he will arrive.
284062	eng	He may well be proud of his bright son.
284063	eng	Where the heck does he work?
284064	eng	There is no need for him to work.
284065	eng	It was extraordinary that he did not agree.
284066	eng	It is strange that he should have lost his way.
284067	eng	He was seen crossing the road.
284069	eng	The results he has got are, in the main, satisfactory.
284070	eng	The crowd yelled when he scored a goal.
284071	eng	He did the work on his own.
284072	eng	Let me know why it was that he came suddenly.
284073	eng	I don't know at all why he quit his job suddenly.
284074	eng	His sudden appearance surprised us all.
284075	eng	I was surprised at his sudden appearance.
284076	eng	His sudden appearance gave rise to trouble.
284077	eng	He was seen to go upstairs.
284078	eng	He came to Japan as a child.
284079	eng	He has been in Japan for three years.
284080	eng	It has been two years since he came to Japan.
284081	eng	He is a famous physicist not only in Japan, but in the world.
284082	eng	It has been three months since he left Japan.
284083	eng	It has been ten years since he left Japan.
284084	eng	The door shut after him.
284085	eng	He came in, and at the same time the bell rang.
284086	eng	I had been reading for an hour when he came in.
284087	eng	I had been reading a book for about an hour when he came in.
284088	eng	Did you notice him coming in?
284089	eng	It was dark when he came in.
284090	eng	The atmosphere became strained when he came.
284091	eng	I had been studying English for two hours when he came in.
284093	eng	I had been reading a book when he came in.
284094	eng	There is no hope of his being appointed.
284095	eng	I would have taken care of him if I had known that he was ill with a fever.
284096	eng	It is true that he went bankrupt.
284097	eng	The first item he bought was an alarm clock.
284098	eng	We took it for granted that he had been punished.
284099	eng	He deserves punishment.
284100	eng	We thought it natural that he should be punished.
284101	eng	He's in charge of the sales department.
284102	eng	He or I am to blame.
284103	eng	It was uncertain whether he would marry her.
284104	eng	I agree to his marrying her.
284105	eng	There is no question that he will marry her.
284106	eng	It is a pity that he can not marry her.
284107	eng	The day came at last when he had to part from her.
284108	eng	It stands to reason that he should apologize to her.
284109	eng	It was cruel of him to say such things to her.
284110	eng	It is cruel of him to say such things to her.
284112	eng	He may well get angry with her.
284113	eng	That he is in love with her is true.
284114	eng	He told her and she smiled.
284115	eng	We couldn't stop him from hitting her.
284116	eng	No one knows whether he loves her or not.
284117	eng	That he loved her was certain.
284118	eng	There's nothing that can be done about his feeling sorry for her.
284119	eng	It's clear from his actions that he loves her.
284120	eng	It was obvious to everybody that he was tired.
284121	eng	We were all ears when he started to tell us his secret.
284122	eng	Spectators gathered as he climbed into the plane.
284123	eng	It's a miracle he wasn't killed in the plane crash.
284124	eng	The picture painted by him is of great value.
284125	eng	Look at the picture which he painted.
284126	eng	He cannot have been ill.
284127	eng	He can't have been ill.
284128	eng	Let's keep it secret that he is ill.
284129	eng	Can it be true that he is ill?
284130	eng	It seems obvious that he is unable to swim.
284131	eng	You must allow for his being ill.
284132	eng	The fact that he was sick was not very impressive to her.
284133	eng	It is true that he is ill.
284134	eng	It never occurred to me that he might be ill.
284135	eng	He can't be ill.
284137	eng	You ought to have known that he was sick in bed.
284138	eng	It was the bad weather that caused his illness.
284139	eng	He fell ill three years ago.
284140	eng	Just because he is poor, it does not follow that he is unhappy.
284141	eng	She despises him only because he is poor.
284142	eng	To my surprise, he failed in the exam.
284143	eng	Everything chose to go wrong during his absence.
284144	eng	His rudeness was conscious, not accidental.
284145	eng	He complains with good reason.
284148	eng	He is managing the business for his father.
284149	eng	He will succeed to his father's property.
284151	eng	His face says that he lost.
284152	eng	The news that he had got injured was a shock to her.
284153	eng	It is an open secret that he deals in weapons.
284154	eng	He entered the room, to be confronted by a policeman.
284156	eng	Hardly had he entered the room, when she burst into tears.
284158	eng	He was seen to enter the room.
284159	eng	I noticed him sneak into the room.
284160	eng	He burst into the room.
284161	eng	He had no sooner gone out of the room than all of them burst out laughing.
284162	eng	I heard him go out of the room.
284163	eng	Seeing that he is angry, there must be some misunderstanding.
284164	eng	We had a hard time doing the job because he was always complaining.
284165	eng	In the years he had worked so hard for equality, new laws had been passed.
284166	eng	He painted the picture which is on the wall.
284167	eng	I didn't know he had decided to leave.
284168	eng	No wonder he didn't feel like studying.
284169	eng	As he was studying, the door was suddenly flung open.
284170	eng	She was all eyes as he opened the jewelry box.
284171	eng	I had just finished my homework when he visited me.
284172	eng	We had known him for five years when he died.
284173	eng	His death was partly my fault.
284174	eng	They say that he has been dead for two years.
284175	eng	It is three years since he died.
284176	eng	I ran after him with a pile of papers that he'd left behind.
284177	eng	I know he is busy.
284178	eng	It is impossible that he is busy.
284179	eng	I know that he was busy.
284180	eng	That he was busy is true.
284182	eng	There is no need to take his advice if you don't want to.
284183	eng	All he wanted was time to finish his painting.
284184	eng	He put the idea into my head.
284185	eng	I could read between the lines that he wanted me to resign.
284186	eng	He had been reading for two hours when she came in.
284187	eng	You can count on him to tell the truth.
284188	eng	His failure to tell me the truth caused an accident.
284189	eng	It is doubtful whether he is telling the truth.
284190	eng	It's no good his trying to find the true reason.
284191	eng	I can't figure out what he really wants.
284192	eng	He writes a daily journal, and that inspired me to try doing the same thing, but in English.
284193	eng	It is true that he goes abroad every year.
284194	eng	His perfect score brought the class average up.
284195	eng	A burglar broke in while he was asleep.
284196	eng	He was about to fall asleep, when he heard his name called.
284197	eng	We are not alone in believing that he is not guilty.
284198	eng	It goes without saying that he is not guilty.
284199	eng	We have every reason to believe him innocent.
284200	eng	I was relieved to hear that he was safe.
284201	eng	They rejoiced when they heard he was safe.
284202	eng	Make certain that he returned home safely.
284203	eng	The news of his safe arrival delighted his family.
284204	eng	I'm anxious for him to return safe.
284205	eng	There is no hope of his coming back safe.
284206	eng	That he is innocent is quite certain.
284207	eng	It was evident to all of us that he was innocent.
284209	eng	No one believes that he is innocent.
284210	eng	If he is innocent, it follows that his wife is guilty.
284212	eng	It is preferable that he gets there by tomorrow.
284213	eng	I wonder whether he'll make it here on time tomorrow. Want to bet a can of juice on it?
284214	eng	I saw him sawing a tree.
284215	eng	She inferred from his silence that he was angry.
284216	eng	Do you think his silence denotes guilt?
284217	eng	I felt myself insulted when he kept silence.
284218	eng	We didn't move so that we would not wake him up.
284219	eng	Let's wait until he wakes up.
284220	eng	When he awoke it was day.
284221	eng	As soon as he returns, I will tell you.
284222	eng	Tell him so, when he comes back.
284223	eng	Give him the message when he comes back.
284224	eng	I will tell him so when he comes back.
284225	eng	When he came back, the woman had walked off.
284226	eng	The hope of his return encouraged me.
284227	eng	How about waiting here until he gets back?
284229	eng	Wait here till he comes back.
284230	eng	There was nothing for it but to wait till he came back.
284231	eng	Whatever will become of his wife if he does not return?
284232	eng	I will finish it by the time he comes back.
284233	eng	We have to stay a decision until he comes back.
284234	eng	I will wait here until he comes back.
284235	eng	Let's wait till he comes back.
284236	eng	It makes no difference to me whether he likes baseball or football.
284237	eng	I want to meet him to see whether or not he gives me useful information.
284238	eng	What do you think made him break his promise?
284239	eng	It is doubtful whether he will keep his word.
284240	eng	It goes without saying that he keeps his promise.
284241	eng	It wasn't easy for him to keep his promise.
284243	eng	He is famous as a good doctor.
284244	eng	He is likely to win the championship.
284245	eng	I could not but admire his courage.
284246	eng	We know him to be a brave man.
284247	eng	It never occurred to me that he might fail his friend.
284248	eng	They say he is guilty, but I believe the contrary.
284251	eng	It cannot be denied that he is guilty.
284253	eng	The fact remains that he is guilty.
284254	eng	I know him for a man of ability.
284255	eng	I see that he is an able man.
284256	eng	The reason which he gave is hard to understand.
284257	eng	It is not so much money as fame that he wanted.
284258	eng	I was taking a bath when he came.
284259	eng	I had written the letter when he came.
284260	eng	When he came, I was doing my homework.
284262	eng	We will leave as soon as he comes.
284263	eng	Let's start as soon as he comes.
284264	eng	Let me know in no time when he comes.
284265	eng	I'll tell him so when he comes.
284266	eng	Let's do it when he comes.
284267	eng	Will you let me know when he comes?
284269	eng	Ask him about it when he comes.
284270	eng	I expected that he would come.
284271	eng	Whether he comes or not, we'll begin the party on time.
284272	eng	I bet five dollars that he will not come.
284273	eng	Seeing that he has not come, he may be on a trip.
284275	eng	It was extraordinary that he did not come.
284276	eng	If he doesn't come, we won't go.
284277	eng	Whether he comes or not, the result will be the same.
284278	eng	Whether he comes or not, I'll go.
284281	eng	It doesn't matter whether he comes or not.
284282	eng	It matters little whether he comes or not.
284283	eng	It is doubtful whether he will come or not.
284284	eng	It is uncertain whether he is coming or not.
284285	eng	I don't know whether he comes or not.
284287	eng	It isn't certain whether he will come or not.
284291	eng	It makes no difference whether he will come or not.
284293	eng	I thought it doubtful whether he would come or not.
284294	eng	I doubt if he will come.
284295	eng	I don't know whether he will come or not.
284296	eng	I am doubtful whether he will come.
284297	eng	It makes no difference whether he comes or not.
284302	eng	I think it possible that he may come.
284303	eng	There's no possibility of his coming.
284304	eng	That he will come is certain.
284306	eng	I telephoned to make sure that he was coming.
284307	eng	The news that he would come, quickly got abroad.
284308	eng	You had better be ready in case he comes.
284309	eng	He will blow our party.
284310	eng	I hope that he will come.
284311	eng	It matters little whether he comes late or not.
284313	eng	It is certain that he will come.
284314	eng	It is no good waiting for him to come.
284315	eng	I will wait here till he comes.
284316	eng	Be waiting here until he comes.
284319	eng	Let's wait till he comes.
284320	eng	Is there any likelihood of his coming?
284322	eng	Let me know the time when he will come.
284323	eng	I will get through with my homework before he comes.
284324	eng	It is a pity that he can't come.
284325	eng	There is no guarantee that he'll be back next week.
284326	eng	It is on his father that he depends.
284327	eng	His disappointment was obvious to everyone.
284328	eng	There is no denying that he is clever.
284329	eng	I remember him as a cute, bright little boy.
284330	eng	He is acting for the chief director.
284331	eng	His standing up was the signal for everybody to start leaving the room.
284332	eng	He cannot have gone against his parents.
284333	eng	They shut his water off because he didn't pay the bill.
284334	eng	It was only recently that he got well.
284335	eng	The girl with whom he fell in love left him after a few months.
284336	eng	It's evident to everybody that he's in love.
284337	eng	The girl to whom he is speaking is Nancy.
284338	eng	The matter that he is talking about is important.
284339	eng	Is he speaking English, French, or German?
284341	eng	When he finished speaking, there was a silence.
284342	eng	He spoke, and all were silent.
284343	eng	To hear him talk, you might take him for a girl.
284344	eng	To hear him talk, you would take him for a foreigner.
284345	eng	To hear him speak, you'd take him for a foreigner.
284346	eng	Who is that gentleman to whom he is speaking?
284347	eng	I asked him to stop talking, but he still went on.
284349	eng	His broken arm was the result of a slip on the ice.
284350	eng	The loss of his sense of smell was due to a head injury.
284351	eng	He is sure to succeed in the attempt.
284352	eng	I wish I were as handsome as he.
284353	eng	He is what we call a walking dictionary.
284354	eng	He is the very man that we've been looking for.
284355	eng	He is the very man that I have waited for.
284356	eng	He may be the very man that I need.
284357	eng	He is the very best inventor in the class.
284358	eng	He is the only person for the job.
284359	eng	He is the very man for the job.
284360	eng	He is the right man for the post.
284362	eng	He is the very man I want.
284363	eng	He is the very person I have wanted to see.
284364	eng	It never occurred to me that he was the right man in the right place.
284365	eng	He is just the man for the job.
284366	eng	It occurred to me that he was the right man.
284367	eng	He is the very best baseball player in our school.
284368	eng	He is a genius, if ever there is one.
284369	eng	He is a real gentleman.
284370	eng	His words pierced to the heart of the matter.
284371	eng	He failed in his attempt to swim across the river.
284372	eng	Only he read the letter.
284373	eng	His parents as well as he are very kind to me.
284374	eng	Not only he but also I am to go.
284375	eng	He is the only one that doesn't observe the custom.
284376	eng	He's so cool that we all think he's charismatic.
284377	eng	What is he like?
284378	eng	Isn't my boyfriend terrible? He always takes me to see horror movies, even though he knows I don't like them. I hate it.
284379	eng	He is my type!
284380	eng	You really have to manage him carefully.
284381	eng	He is a proud one, you see.
284382	eng	He's supposed to be living in Nagano. What's he doing at Tokyo station?
284383	eng	If he can do it well, so much more can we.
284384	eng	I am to meet him at ten.
284385	eng	I'd better see him.
284386	eng	When I understood him I thought better of him.
284387	eng	I feel comfortable in his company.
284388	eng	Being with him always makes me happy.
284389	eng	I never feel at ease in his company.
284390	eng	Don't be so foolish as to go with him.
284391	eng	May I go with him?
284392	eng	I feel relaxed with him.
284393	eng	I wonder what's wrong with him. He keeps breaking his word these days.
284394	eng	There is no getting along with him.
284395	eng	He is very difficult to get along with.
284396	eng	It's very hard to get along with him.
284397	eng	I don't think I can get along with him.
284398	eng	Not a day passes without having an argument with him.
284399	eng	I dream of seeing him there.
284400	eng	For his part he could have done worse.
284401	eng	There was no irritation on his part.
284402	eng	He is the last person I would want to go skiing with.
284404	eng	I compromised with him on the matter.
284405	eng	He and his companion asked me to come along with them.
284407	eng	I don't think your seeing him is good for you.
284408	eng	I had a quarrel with him about trifles.
284409	eng	I'll fix it up with him.
284410	eng	My association with him did not last long.
284411	eng	I inferred from our conversation that he was unhappy with his job.
284413	eng	I benefited much from my association with him.
284414	eng	He and I have been good friends since we were children.
284415	eng	Do you want me to fix you up with him?
284416	eng	Don't disappoint him.
284417	eng	I have known him for ten years.
284418	eng	I have been on friendly terms with him for more than twenty years.
284419	eng	Don't get too close with him.
284420	eng	I get on well with him.
284421	eng	I've been friends with him since we were children.
284422	eng	I'm always meeting him there.
284423	eng	He and I have a near-telepathic understanding of each other. No sooner does one of us say something than the other is already responding.
284424	eng	Do you have access to him?
284425	eng	I cannot get along with him.
284427	eng	I often went fishing with him.
284428	eng	I want to talk frankly with him.
284429	eng	I haven't met him.
284430	eng	He and I have been inseparable friends since our student days.
284431	eng	I am in touch with him.
284432	eng	He's just a business associate.
284435	eng	I just can't get along with him.
284436	eng	I'm on good terms with him.
284438	eng	I once sat at the same table with him at a dinner party.
284439	eng	He is a childhood friend.
284440	eng	Shake hands with him.
284441	eng	If you disagree with him, he is liable to get angry.
284442	eng	Unlike him, his son is tall.
284443	eng	I disputed with him about world peace for an hour.
284444	eng	I feel secure with him.
284449	eng	I had to choose going with him or staying here alone.
284450	eng	Those whom he lived with respected him.
284451	eng	I'm going fishing with him.
284452	eng	I can't bear to work with him.
284453	eng	I hesitated to go to the movie with him.
284454	eng	I'm looking forward to seeing him.
284455	eng	I was happy to see him.
284456	eng	Why did you turn away when you met him?
284457	eng	It's no use arguing with him.
284458	eng	It is no use trying to argue with him.
284459	eng	It is vain to argue with him.
284460	eng	No sooner had I come into contact with him than I determined to get to know him well.
284461	eng	I would rather die than marry him.
284462	eng	I don't intend to marry him.
284463	eng	It is no use arguing with him.
284464	eng	Who is younger, he or I?
284465	eng	He and I are pretty much the same build.
284466	eng	I have nothing in common with him.
284467	eng	His ideas conflict with mine.
284468	eng	He and I walked together.
284469	eng	He and I are cousins.
284470	eng	He and I are classmates.
284471	eng	He and I discussed the waste problem in terms of recycling.
284472	eng	He and I can not speak Spanish.
284473	eng	He and I stayed at the hotel.
284474	eng	He and I are brothers.
284475	eng	He and I are teachers.
284476	eng	He and I are bosom friends.
284477	eng	He and I share a room.
284478	eng	He is my namesake, but no relation.
284480	eng	You must not come in contact with him.
284481	eng	You must not keep in touch with him.
284482	eng	You should have nothing to do with him.
284483	eng	I had to meet him halfway.
284484	eng	I got to know him.
284485	eng	I have known him for two years.
284486	eng	How long have you known him?
284487	eng	Have you known him for a long time?
284488	eng	I fell into company with him.
284489	eng	I want to come to terms with him.
284490	eng	No one can cope with him.
284491	eng	When I talked with him on the phone, he sounded tired.
284492	eng	I, as well as he, am not convinced.
284493	eng	You as well as he are diligent.
284494	eng	I am no more diligent than he is.
284495	eng	I cannot tell him from his brother.
284496	eng	It is easy to tell him from his brother.
284497	eng	A gulf divided him from them.
284498	eng	When he got her alone for a moment, he asked for a date.
284499	eng	He and she got married three years ago.
284500	eng	Don't keep company with him.
284501	eng	He is difficult to get along with.
284502	eng	I found it difficult to get along with him.
284503	eng	You'd better not keep company with him.
284504	eng	We can just about read each other's minds.
284505	eng	Make an appointment with him.
284506	eng	He and his friend sat on the bench.
284507	eng	I am meeting him next Friday.
284508	eng	Could you get in touch with him?
284509	eng	I want to contact him. Do you know his phone number?
284511	eng	I want to have a talk with him.
284512	eng	Did you ever talk to him?
284513	eng	Please don't cut in while I'm talking with him.
284514	eng	Keep off the religious issue when talking with him.
284515	eng	It doesn't pay to talk with him.
284516	eng	It is no use talking to him. He never listens.
284517	eng	We may as well begin without him.
284518	eng	He is good for five thousand dollars.
284519	eng	He'll always come through.
284520	eng	I'm sure he can give you a good game of tennis.
284521	eng	He is doing a super job.
284522	eng	He can say such things.
284523	eng	He could do it.
284524	eng	No matter what he may do, he will be praised.
284526	eng	He can be trusted.
284527	eng	He is able to do it better than I am.
284528	eng	He deserves a promotion.
284529	eng	He is a good match for me.
284530	eng	He will make my sister a good husband.
284531	eng	I owe him 1,000 dollars.
284532	eng	He suckered me out of ten dollars.
284533	eng	He kept me waiting for an hour.
284534	eng	He was paid 10000 dollars.
284535	eng	Don't speak to him like that.
284536	eng	As soon as she met him, she burst into tears.
284537	eng	You will have to apologize when you see him.
284538	eng	If a fire should break out in your neighborhood, what would you do?
284539	eng	Let me introduce you to him.
284541	eng	Don't expect too much of him.
284542	eng	He will be given American citizenship.
284543	eng	We must stop him from doing such stupid things.
284544	eng	He put me off with a vague answer.
284545	eng	I threw him a nice ball.
284546	eng	When I told him I had some good news for him, he was all ears.
284547	eng	When would you like to see him?
284549	eng	I offered him whisky or gin, but he said he didn't need either.
284550	eng	I got even with him.
284551	eng	I expect much of him.
284552	eng	I will make him pay the money.
284553	eng	When I asked him to lend me some money, he turned down my request.
284554	eng	You might just as well throw your money into the sea as lend it to him.
284555	eng	Let him pay for it.
284556	eng	I've got to remember to return this money to him.
284557	eng	I accommodated him with money.
284558	eng	He gave me a cold.
284559	eng	We've got to shake him up.
284560	eng	I had him carry my bag.
284561	eng	Please pour him a glass of beer.
284562	eng	Can he do this job?
284563	eng	He is not equal to the task.
284564	eng	If he finds out, certainly he will be very angry.
284565	eng	I will have him repair this watch.
284566	eng	Shall I have him mail this letter?
284567	eng	I'll get him to carry this case upstairs.
284568	eng	I want him to read this.
284569	eng	I tried in vain to persuade him not to smoke any more.
284570	eng	Do you want him?
284571	eng	I'm going to ask him for an autograph. Do you have anything to write with?
284572	eng	The fan asked for his autograph.
284573	eng	I cannot do otherwise than obey him.
284574	eng	Tell him to come here at once.
284575	eng	I demanded that he pay the debt back at once.
284576	eng	I asked him to do that.
284577	eng	We made a point of his going there.
284578	eng	It is no use trying to convince him of that.
284579	eng	It was discreet of you to keep it a secret from him.
284580	eng	Don't trust him with such a large sum of money.
284582	eng	I will have him carry the baggage upstairs.
284583	eng	When I told him I liked the picture, I really meant that.
284584	eng	He shall pay you the money at once.
284585	eng	Do you think that he is equal to the task?
284586	eng	Get him to help you with the work.
284588	eng	Did you acquaint him with the fact?
284589	eng	I gave him the book.
284590	eng	Is it necessary for me to explain the reason to him?
284591	eng	Let him do it.
284592	eng	I couldn't get him to do it.
284593	eng	He shall have it.
284594	eng	Don't let him touch it.
284595	eng	Let him do it alone.
284596	eng	Don't let him do it alone.
284597	eng	It is marvelous that he should have done such a thing.
284598	eng	Don't put such silly thoughts into his head.
284599	eng	You shouldn't say such rude things to him.
284600	eng	Give him plenty of work to do.
284601	eng	You can ask him for help.
284603	eng	I couldn't get him to stop smoking.
284604	eng	It is next to impossible to make him stop smoking.
284605	eng	I warned you off about him.
284606	eng	Give him a break!
284607	eng	Give him a fair half.
284608	eng	That is all I know about him.
284609	eng	I will tell you about him.
284610	eng	I had enough to keep up with him.
284611	eng	What I told you about him also holds good for his brother.
284612	eng	Rumors were current about him.
284613	eng	Many a story has been told about him.
284614	eng	Judging by what everyone says about him, I think he is just the right man for the post.
284615	eng	The trouble with him is that he is not punctual.
284617	eng	I managed to make him understand it.
284618	eng	I may have met him somewhere before, but I can't recall where.
284620	eng	Ask him where he parked his car.
284622	eng	It was easy for him to answer the quiz.
284623	eng	It is easy for him to carry the stone.
284624	eng	To him wealth is the great prize in life.
284625	eng	Everything went well with him.
284626	eng	It will be difficult for him to speak in public.
284627	eng	It was difficult for him to hide his pride in his success.
284628	eng	She is everything to him.
284629	eng	It's easy for him to compose a good poem.
284630	eng	He won't have a look-in.
284631	eng	However much advice we give him, he still does exactly what he wants.
284632	eng	Whatever faults he may have, meanness is not one of them.
284633	eng	He has a daughter who is pretty.
284634	eng	He doesn't have the ability to do the work properly.
284635	eng	He has a daughter who is very pretty.
284636	eng	I have no fault to find with him.
284637	eng	He has several men to work for him.
284638	eng	He is a bit of a coward.
284639	eng	He has knowledge and experience as well.
284640	eng	He has a son and two daughters.
284641	eng	He had two or three rather competent assistants.
284642	eng	He has two sons that don't go to school yet.
284643	eng	He has two daughters, one is a pianist and the other is a violist.
284644	eng	He has two daughters.
284645	eng	He has no less than three hundred books.
284646	eng	He has three sons, who work in the same office.
284647	eng	He has a strong shoulder for you to lean on.
284648	eng	I'd rather not meet him.
284649	eng	He was suspect in that he had no alibi.
284650	eng	He has the backing of a certain politician.
284651	eng	I cannot thank him enough.
284652	eng	In an emergency he had nothing to fall back upon.
284653	eng	As is usual with him, he arrived a quarter of an hour late.
284654	eng	I'm always surprised by him.
284655	eng	He has a nice place in the country.
284656	eng	For all his faults, I like him.
284657	eng	It seemed that he was short of money.
284658	eng	He has no girlfriend.
284659	eng	He has a fair income.
284660	eng	He has something of the artist in him.
284661	eng	I can't seem to get him to fix this machine.
284662	eng	He had no idea what these words meant.
284663	eng	He is equal to this work.
284664	eng	He did not relish this simple family life.
284665	eng	He has no title to this land.
284666	eng	Let's conceal this secret from him.
284667	eng	It's as easy as pie for him.
284668	eng	I don't remember when I first met him.
284669	eng	He has a son whose name is John.
284670	eng	He had a magnificent sense of humor.
284671	eng	He had a lot of work to do.
284672	eng	He has a lot of things to do.
284673	eng	He had no particular reason to go there.
284674	eng	To him the five minutes seemed like as five hours.
284675	eng	He had no friend from whom he could borrow the money.
284676	eng	He found the shoes too small for him.
284677	eng	He is not up to the task.
284681	eng	He has the ability to do the job.
284682	eng	I doubt his ability to do the job.
284683	eng	He is competent for the job.
284684	eng	He is to blame for the failure.
284685	eng	He had enough wisdom to refuse the offer.
284686	eng	He has the strength to survive the illness.
284687	eng	He couldn't understand the sentence.
284688	eng	Will he have the backbone to speak out against the bill?
284689	eng	He didn't have enough experience to cope with the problem.
284691	eng	I don't doubt his ability to do it.
284692	eng	He could make nothing of it.
284693	eng	He is unable to do it.
284694	eng	He had no confidence to do it.
284695	eng	He has good grounds for believing that.
284696	eng	It is right up his alley.
284697	eng	He doesn't need such treatment.
284698	eng	Having often seen him, I know him quite well.
284699	eng	He is easy to reach.
284700	eng	He had a strong alibi.
284701	eng	I just can't seem to outdo him. I've got a lot to learn.
284702	eng	There's something unusual about him.
284704	eng	There's something mysterious about him.
284705	eng	He doesn't have a dry sense of humor.
284706	eng	It is difficult to gain access to him.
284707	eng	He has no specific aim.
284708	eng	He had little, if anything, to say.
284709	eng	I'll be seeing him again.
284710	eng	He had plenty of fight left in him.
284711	eng	He talks as if he knew everything.
284712	eng	He has another son.
284713	eng	He can not endure already.
284714	eng	I can't put up with him any longer.
284715	eng	He doesn't understand the principle of the thing.
284716	eng	He seems to be bankrupt of humor.
284717	eng	As is often the case with him, he cheated in that exam.
284718	eng	As is often the case with him, he went to the office without shaving.
284719	eng	As is often the case with him, he left his textbook at home.

285023	eng	You didn't see him.
285024	eng	Tell him not to be late for school.
285025	eng	Don't meddle in his affairs.
285026	eng	So far as he was concerned, things were going well.
285027	eng	I found it truly regrettable that he should take offence.
285028	eng	He had the jump on me.
285029	eng	He is no longer full of activity.
285030	eng	To add to his difficulties his son died a sudden death.
285031	eng	He acquired the habit of smoking.
285032	eng	Don't cross him or you'll regret it.
285033	eng	Don't oppose him.
285034	eng	I advised him to take a rest.
285035	eng	I'll ask him where he is planning to go during the vacation.
285036	eng	I signed for him to approach.
285037	eng	I demanded that he should pay.
285038	eng	You had as well throw your money into the ditch as give it to him.
285039	eng	You should have known better than to lend him money.
285040	eng	It was very kind of you to lend him some money.
285043	eng	It is stupid of you to lend him your money.
285044	eng	What a fool I was to lend him the money.
285045	eng	He shall go to the bank.
285047	eng	Let him play your guitar.
285048	eng	I mentioned your name to him.
285049	eng	Ask him to sketch out his plan.
285050	eng	Did you advise him to go to the police?
285053	eng	It was difficult to persuade him to change his mind.
285054	eng	Nothing could induce him to change his mind.
285055	eng	Luckily he did not see me.
285056	eng	I remember giving him the key.
285057	eng	Give him rigid training.
285058	eng	I would be grateful if you could give him some information on local conditions.
285059	eng	Let him say what he will.
285060	eng	Let him have his say.
285061	eng	He had his share of luck.
285062	eng	Please tell him to get rid of the dead leaves.
285063	eng	I left the rest to him and went out.
285064	eng	I have given leave to do what he likes.
285065	eng	Woe betide him!
285067	eng	I entrusted my property to him.
285068	eng	It is useless to try to persuade him to agree.
285070	eng	I remember well the time I first met him.
285072	eng	Will you tell him I called?
285073	eng	It took a long time for me to convince him that I was right.
285074	eng	I couldn't make him understand my English.
285075	eng	I had him paint my house.
285076	eng	I got him to mend my watch.
285077	eng	I got him to clean my room.
285078	eng	We learned that he had an accident.
285079	eng	I think it is important to tell him the facts.
285081	eng	We didn't need to ask him to resign.
285082	eng	After I asked him a question, what he meant was clarified.
285083	eng	Did you acknowledge his letter?
285085	eng	You cannot prevent him from drinking.
285086	eng	I intended to hand the paper to him, but I forgot to.
285087	eng	It's no use asking him for help.
285088	eng	She was too proud to ask him for help.
285089	eng	It was foolish of her to ask him for help.
285090	eng	It is a good idea asking him for help.
285092	eng	I gave him some helpful advice.
285093	eng	Why don't we ask his advice?
285094	eng	I not only gave him some advice, I gave him some money.
285095	eng	There's little merit in asking him for help.
285096	eng	He is impossible to beat.
285097	eng	I mailed a parcel to him.
285098	eng	If you would like me to introduce you to him, I will write him right away.
285099	eng	Please give him detailed and specific directions.
285101	eng	She cooked him meals.
285102	eng	I provided him with food.
285103	eng	I furnished them with food.
285104	eng	He got a new job.
285105	eng	I impregnated his mind with new ideas.
285106	eng	I am deeply in debt to him.
285107	eng	It is honest of her to tell him the truth.
285108	eng	His prospects of success are barred.
285109	eng	I admit that he is sincere.
285110	eng	He was absolved from blame.
285111	eng	He is under suspicion of theft.
285112	eng	His explanation is by no means satisfactory.
285113	eng	Please wait on him first.
285114	eng	I was itching for him to finish his talk.
285115	eng	I asked him to open the window.
285116	eng	I met him halfway and lent him $100.
285117	eng	Try sounding him out and see if he'll come around.
285118	eng	I urge you to tell him the truth.
285119	eng	His wife's misunderstanding about him did not go away.
285120	eng	My attitude towards him changed.
285121	eng	Tell him to wait.
285122	eng	Let me put him on.
285123	eng	I undertook responsibility for him.
285124	eng	Just a minute, please. I'll call him to the phone.
285125	eng	I handed a map to him.
285126	eng	Try to keep up with him.
285128	eng	You should apologize to him for coming late.
285129	eng	I told him not to be late.
285130	eng	I cautioned him against being late.
285131	eng	Giving advice to him is like talking to a brick wall.
285132	eng	There is no point in giving him advice.
285133	eng	I will write him a civil answer.
285134	eng	I wrote a long letter to him.
285135	eng	I hope he will live long.
285139	eng	It took me at least half an hour to get the message across to him in English.
285140	eng	I had difficulty in making him understand the message in English.
285141	eng	I called him up.
285142	eng	Did you telephone him?
285143	eng	Why don't you call him up?
285144	eng	I tried to call him, but the line was busy, and I couldn't get through.
285146	eng	I'll give him a buzz.
285147	eng	Please call him up.
285148	eng	I forget to telephone him.
285149	eng	I should have known better than to call him.
285150	eng	I called him up, but he wasn't there.
285151	eng	I was going to call him, but thought better of it.
285152	eng	Please ask him to call me.
285153	eng	I tried to call him up, but the line was busy.
285154	eng	Let him use the telephone.
285155	eng	I couldn't get him on the phone.
285156	eng	I hope he hasn't had an accident.
285157	eng	Don't tell him the answer.
285158	eng	I don't want to bow down to him.
285159	eng	I felt sympathy for him.
285160	eng	I read the letter to him.
285161	eng	Ask him if he can speak Japanese.
285162	eng	There is no point in trying to introduce Japanese literature to him.
285163	eng	If you leave it to him, it'll be all right.
285164	eng	Let's leave it up to him.
285165	eng	It was gambling that brought about his ruin.
285167	eng	Make him feel that he is still someone important.
285168	eng	You may as well tell him nothing about her.
285169	eng	Lend him as much money as he needs.
285170	eng	What he needs is not money but love.
285171	eng	Don't give him more money than is necessary.
285172	eng	Nothing comes amiss to him.
285173	eng	The judgement went against him.
285174	eng	It's no easy task to keep up with him.
285175	eng	He has none of his father's aggressiveness.
285176	eng	I want to get even with him for the insult.
285178	eng	It is no use getting angry at him.
285179	eng	I had a good dinner at his expense.
285180	eng	It is just that we should pay his share.
285181	eng	I keep telling him to listen, but he won't.
285182	eng	She said good-bye to him and left the house.
285183	eng	I took leave of him.
285184	eng	Grab him.
285185	eng	It is careless of you tell him the truth.
285186	eng	I would rather you hadn't told him the truth.
285187	eng	I'm crazy about him!
285189	eng	Give him the benefit of the doubt.
285190	eng	The task assigned to him was to do marketing research.
285191	eng	I have business with him.
285192	eng	I will have him come.
285193	eng	Have him come.
285194	eng	I'll ask him if he will come.
285195	eng	I had no choice but to do what he asked.
285196	eng	If you ask him, he will help you.
285197	eng	He accommodated me when I asked him for change.
285198	eng	She turned her head away lest he see her tears.
285199	eng	There's no way to get in touch with him.
285200	eng	Judging from what he says, he seems to be a man of ability.
285201	eng	It is useless to talk to him.
285202	eng	Few girls can even speak to him.
285203	eng	You may as well talk to a stone wall as to him.
285204	eng	It is no use talking with him.
285205	eng	You may speak to him.
285207	eng	It would be better for you to speak to him.
285208	eng	It would be nice to tell her.
285209	eng	I didn't need to tell him.
285210	eng	What is the theme of his latest novel?
285211	eng	You can rely on his proven ability.
285212	eng	His anger is understandable.
285213	eng	It's difficult to evaluate his ability.
285214	eng	His two sons wanted their father's house.
285215	eng	One of his two daughters lives in Tokyo, and the other in Nara.
285218	eng	His idea is superior to yours.
285220	eng	His idea is beyond the reach of my understanding.
285221	eng	His idea counts for nothing.
285222	eng	Judging from his accent, he is from Kansai.
285223	eng	You can see from his chin that takes after his father.
285224	eng	I hit him on the chin.
285225	eng	That nickname fits him perfectly.
285226	eng	I've had quite enough of his impudence.
285227	eng	His advice inclined me to change my mind.
285228	eng	His advice encouraged me to try it again.
285230	eng	None of his advice was very useful.
285231	eng	Did that uncle of his often visit America?
285232	eng	I can't stand that attitude of his.
285233	eng	That story of his sounds very unlikely.
285234	eng	All his endeavors proved unsuccessful.
285235	eng	His alibi is above suspicion.
285236	eng	His alibi seemed cast-iron.
285237	eng	His poor dog is still alive.
285239	eng	Try to bring out the best in him.
285240	eng	According to him, she is honest.
285241	eng	What he said bears out my assumption.
285243	eng	I can hardly hear him.
285244	eng	What he said was brief and to the point.
285245	eng	What he says is brief and to the point.
285246	eng	I can't make him out.
285247	eng	Mr. Suzuki is angry about Tom's prank.
285248	eng	His shot didn't carry well against the wind.
285249	eng	He lived and died in obscurity.
285250	eng	What he said is capable of several interpretations.
285253	eng	What he said is a good idea.
285254	eng	What he said is still dark.
285255	eng	Is there any evidence that supports his position?
285256	eng	What he says has nothing to do with this problem.
285257	eng	What he's saying just isn't consistent.
285258	eng	Don't speak ill of him in his absence.
285260	eng	His cordiality may not be authentic.
285261	eng	His family is very large.
285262	eng	His nagging distressed her.
285263	eng	Did you hear of him?
285264	eng	If it had not been for his error, we would have won.
285265	eng	What size of collar does he take?
285266	eng	His nephew was absorbed in the splendid fireworks.
285267	eng	His motorcycle is the latest model.
285268	eng	His overcoat is worn out.
285269	eng	He blew the deal.
285270	eng	Thanks to him, I could get a job.
285271	eng	He stuck me with debts of 1,000,000 yen.
285272	eng	His grandfather died of cancer a year ago.
285273	eng	His grandfather went off the deep end about five years ago.
285274	eng	His grandfather is what is called a self-made man.
285275	eng	How old might his grandfather be?
285276	eng	His uncle will undertake the responsibility for him.
285277	eng	His uncle went to Europe on business a week ago and he is now either in London or in Paris.
285278	eng	His uncle died five years ago.
285280	eng	His grandmother looks healthy.
285281	eng	His aunt takes care of his dog during the day.
285282	eng	His aunt looks young.
285283	eng	The ice gave way under his weight.
285284	eng	His money was all gone.
285285	eng	His brother passed away last month.
285286	eng	His brother is a famous soccer player.
285287	eng	No one will be caught by his flattery.
285288	eng	His father died after his return home.
285289	eng	His father doesn't play golf.
285290	eng	It is said that his father died in a foreign country.
285291	eng	I hear that his father is abroad.
285292	eng	It is said that his father is in hospital now.
285293	eng	His father calls him Tom.
285294	eng	His mother is constantly complaining about it.
285295	eng	His mother used to be a singer.
285296	eng	His mother is an English teacher.
285297	eng	His mother looks young for her age.
285298	eng	His mother will not consent to his going there alone.
285299	eng	His bag was badly damaged.
285300	eng	His camera is three times as expensive as mine.
285301	eng	Let me go in place of him.
285302	eng	His affectations are annoying.
285303	eng	His absence yesterday was due to his cold.
285304	eng	Our conversation was interrupted by his sneezes.
285306	eng	There is no end to his complaining.
285307	eng	He studied as hard as anybody in his class.
285309	eng	At times I can't understand him.
285310	eng	I know nothing about him.
285311	eng	I don't know any more about him. I know him, but only to say hello to.
285312	eng	She may well be angry at his remark.
285313	eng	The magic of his words attracted the audience.
285314	eng	It's hardly worthwhile worrying about him.
285315	eng	I do not know anything about him.
285318	eng	I can answer for his honesty, since I have known him for a long time.
285319	eng	Do not take any notice of him.
285320	eng	I just know his name, that's all.
285321	eng	I thought he was an American but he turned out to be an Englishman.
285322	eng	I could not help feeling sorry for him.
285323	eng	It gradually dawned on me that I had misunderstood him.
285324	eng	To do him justice, he is honest.
285325	eng	To do him justice, he is a man of common sense.
285327	eng	You say he is a workaholic, but you know there are some people who feel happiest when they're working.
285328	eng	Don't laugh at him.
285329	eng	I cannot help laughing at him.
285330	eng	The more you know about him, the more you like him.
285331	eng	I cannot but feel sorry for him.
285332	eng	Tell me about him.
285333	eng	He has had a clean record for the past ten years.
285334	eng	This invention of his proved to be of great value.
285335	eng	This book of his isn't interesting at all.
285336	eng	At his concerts, she screams for him from a distance.
285337	eng	His concert attracted many people.
285338	eng	His concert was unreal.
285339	eng	It is worthwhile listening to his concert.
285340	eng	What he did was against humanity.
285341	eng	What he did is not wrong.
285342	eng	His shirt was stained with sauce.
285343	eng	He spoke too fast for the student.
285344	eng	Some people laugh at his jokes, but others don't.
285345	eng	His joke killed me.
285346	eng	Everybody could not help laughing at his joke.
285347	eng	His jokes are always flat.
285349	eng	I could not help laughing at his jokes.
285350	eng	I couldn't help laughing at his joke.
285351	eng	Every effort will be made to obtain tickets to his showing.
285352	eng	His shirt was gray and the tie was yellow.
285353	eng	He is far above me in skiing.
285354	eng	His skill at skiing is the admiration of us.
285355	eng	We fully appreciate his excellence as a skier.
285356	eng	His great symphony was performed.
285357	eng	He's really something to see every time he gets up on stage.
285358	eng	His excellent work stands out.
285359	eng	I was disappointed with his speech.
285360	eng	Tell me the substance of his speech.
285361	eng	The content of his speech was very good.
285362	eng	His speech went on and on.
285363	eng	His speech bored me.
285364	eng	His speech appealed to us.
285365	eng	His speech was short and to the point.
285366	eng	His speech moved them to tears.
285367	eng	The content of his speech was interesting.
285368	eng	He was purged of all suspicion.
285369	eng	The seat of his pants is shiny.
285370	eng	His slacks are all wrinkled.
285371	eng	His extravagance is out of proportion to his wage.
285372	eng	Don't let what he said get to you. He was just getting back at you for what you said.
285373	eng	Such conduct on his part gave rise to her parents' suspicion.
285374	eng	He said the words in a very small voice.
285375	eng	His courage is worthy of high praise.
285376	eng	That paper of his deal with environmental problems.
285377	eng	Do you know the way that he does it?
285378	eng	His brief repose was interrupted by her arrival.
285379	eng	His overall was covered with paint-stains.
285380	eng	He has atrocious table manners.
285381	eng	His designs are highly original.
285382	eng	I have been in his employ for just twenty years.
285383	eng	Each time I went to see him, I found him at work.
285384	eng	You had better make sure that he is at home, before you call on him.
285385	eng	He had everyone howling with his stories of all his past bloopers.
285386	eng	I made a dive for his knife.
285387	eng	His accent suggests he is a foreigner.
285388	eng	Judging from his accent, he must be from Kyushu.
285389	eng	His tie came undone.
285390	eng	His tie corresponds well with his suit.
285391	eng	I began to see what he was getting at.
285392	eng	The insurance on his violin costs $200 a year.
285393	eng	His bike ran into a guard-rail.
285394	eng	The food is very good in the dormitory where he lives.
285395	eng	His foolish proposal was approved unanimously.
285396	eng	His object in traveling to Paris was to meet with the President.
285397	eng	He has a bad style.
285398	eng	He is making good progress in playing the piano.
285399	eng	His piano playing sounded fantastic.
285400	eng	His business plan looks good on paper but I get the feeling it would never work in practice.
285401	eng	I was annoyed with him for being so late.
285402	eng	I slept through his dull speech.
285403	eng	We all laughed at his pink tuxedo.
285404	eng	His immoral actions did not go unnoticed.
285405	eng	The girl looked embarrassed at his rude question.
285406	eng	His pride was slightly touched.
285407	eng	His knowledge of French is poor.
285408	eng	It is evident from his behavior that he lies.
285409	eng	His behavior is always honorable.
285410	eng	His behavior was anything but polite.
285411	eng	His behavior won general applause.
285412	eng	His behavior really got on my nerves.
285413	eng	I felt disgust at his behavior.
285414	eng	I'm looking forward to his present.
285415	eng	His project was funded by grants.
285416	eng	He is taller than his brother.
285417	eng	He can do it far better than I can.
285418	eng	There was no objection on his part.
285419	eng	There was no mistake on his part.
285420	eng	The odds are in his favor.
285421	eng	His bark is worse than his bite.
285423	eng	The scar on his cheek hardly shows now.
285424	eng	The spectators were excited by his home run.
285425	eng	His handling of the ball borders on wizardry.
285426	eng	All of us went besides him.
285427	eng	Everyone but him comes from Kyushu.
285428	eng	I have no money in my pocket.
285429	eng	Her cheeks began to glow at his compliments.
285430	eng	His diligence turned out a disadvantage after all.
285431	eng	They attributed his bad manners to lack of training in childhood.
285432	eng	I was embarrassed by his bad manners.
285433	eng	His manners were far from pleasant.
285434	eng	His stupid answer surprised everybody.
285435	eng	He's well respected for his management skills.
285436	eng	His error brought the project to nothing.
285437	eng	May his soul rest in Heaven.
285438	eng	Can you establish his innocence?
285439	eng	His son has a gift for music.
285440	eng	There is no doubt that his sons are good boys.
285441	eng	His e-mail address is hirosey@genet.co.jp.
285442	eng	No woman could measure up to his standard.
285443	eng	He did a real snow job on my daughter.
285444	eng	He bored me with his endless tales.
285445	eng	There must be some reason for what he has done.
285446	eng	It was entirely by chance that I found out what he was doing.
285448	eng	His way of doing things was much disliked.
285449	eng	His infectious humor stimulated applause.
285450	eng	He has a very good sense of humor.
285451	eng	This is a historical examination of the birth of his unique architectural style.
285452	eng	I was most impressed by his good behavior.
285453	eng	I don't go for men of his type.
285454	eng	Such an alert man as he couldn't have failed to adapt himself to the new situation.
285455	eng	Such a diligent man as he is sure to succeed.
285456	eng	We shall not see his like again.
285459	eng	It will take you a whole lifetime to understand a crank like him.
285460	eng	It is no wonder that a man of his ability is successful.
285462	eng	His lighter has done ten years' service.
285463	eng	His report has just been handed in.
285464	eng	I'm annoyed at his selfishness.
285465	eng	His selfishness was such that nobody liked him.
285466	eng	Nothing vexed her more than his selfishness.
285467	eng	His wagon drew up at the entrance to the market.
285468	eng	I don't like his affected manner of speaking.
285469	eng	It was difficult to live on his meager earnings.
285470	eng	Nothing replaced his love.
285472	eng	His love grew cold.
285473	eng	His affection is cooling.
285474	eng	His poor grades may come from lack of study.
285475	eng	I will cure him of the bad habit.
285476	eng	There is no sense in speaking ill of him.
285477	eng	Don't call him names.
285478	eng	But for his steady support, my venture would have resulted in a failure.
285479	eng	I'm anxious about his safety.
285480	eng	His idea is too abstract to be of practical use to us.
285481	eng	His plan seems very good from my point of view.
285482	eng	His request was equivalent to an order.
285483	eng	His great learning has at last been recognized.
285484	eng	His great ability was fully appreciated by his friends.
285485	eng	It should be added that his remarks had no direct influence on the constituency.
285486	eng	I do not suspect that his opinion is any different from ours.
285487	eng	His ideas carry a lot of weight.
285488	eng	His opinions carry weight.
285489	eng	His opinion is free from prejudice.
285490	eng	I am in accord with his view.

285498	eng	His view is quite logical.
285499	eng	His opinions are in accord with ours.
285500	eng	His opinion is quite different from ours.
285501	eng	His opinion was completely beside the point.
285502	eng	His remarks added up to a condemnation of my plan.
285503	eng	He is humble about his opinion.

285518	eng	He differs in opinion from her.
285519	eng	His opinions are variable.
285520	eng	His opinion inclines towards the conservative.
285521	eng	His remark was really out of line.
285523	eng	It would not be amiss to ask his views.
285524	eng	I want you to meet him in order to hear his opinion.
285525	eng	Don't go against his wishes.
285526	eng	We should confirm his intentions once more.
285527	eng	He won the day by virtue of his strength of will.
285528	eng	His will was transmitted to his younger brother.
285529	eng	His nasty comments fueled the argument.
285530	eng	His clothes are worn out.
285531	eng	His ashes are buried here.
285532	eng	He leaves a widow and a daughter.
285533	eng	His doctor told him not to drink alcohol.
285534	eng	His doctor advised him to give up smoking.
285535	eng	His family moved into a new house in the suburbs.
285536	eng	His only son succeeded to all his wealth.
285537	eng	All his hopes evaporated when he lost his only son in the war.
285538	eng	His life was full of ups and downs.
285539	eng	His life was full of variety.
285541	eng	His chief attraction lies in his character, not his books.
285542	eng	His drinking habit is an old one.
285543	eng	His right leg was asleep.
285544	eng	His lie complicated matters.
285545	eng	I know of him, but I don't know him personally.
285546	eng	Have you ever heard of him?
285547	eng	His driving was against traffic rules.
285548	eng	He is a very careful driver.
285549	eng	His doom is sealed.
285550	eng	His luck has changed, he is going to the dogs, but no one even lifts a finger to help him.
285551	eng	His influence is still potent.
285552	eng	What I don't like about his films is that they're not grounded in reality.
285553	eng	There are few, if any, mistakes in his English.
285554	eng	His score on the English test is quite satisfactory.
285555	eng	I'm amazed at his rapid progress in English.
285556	eng	His knowledge of English is poor.
285557	eng	His ability in English is above average.

285573	eng	With his father's help, he would have succeeded in this task sooner.
285574	eng	Had it not been for his aid, I could not have finished the work.

304916	eng	Both he and his sister are invited to the party.
304917	eng	He is neither a stock nor a stone.
304918	eng	He isn't coming, either.
304919	eng	They were walking two hundred meters in advance.
304920	eng	Neither of them seemed old.
304921	eng	Some pitied them.
304922	eng	What they said to you is exactly the opposite of what they told me yesterday.
304923	eng	Their excuses cut no ice with her.
304924	eng	There is no telling when they will come.
304925	eng	I'm ready whenever they challenge me.
304926	eng	Do you know when they will arrive?
304927	eng	It was obvious that they had told a lie.
304928	eng	She was dismayed at their ignorance in etiquette.
304929	eng	I know they are in love with each other.
304930	eng	I wish they would stop fighting.
304931	eng	They have been here for an hour.
304932	eng	The fact that they came here is undeniable.
304933	eng	What they are doing is ruining the economy.
304934	eng	I was informed that they had gone on strike.
304935	eng	Then it dawned on me that they were speaking Spanish.
304936	eng	They have a less selfish reason for trying it.
304937	eng	It is worthwhile to ask what sort of picture they found there.
304938	eng	They don't seem to approve of the plan.
304939	eng	They were at the bottom of the scheme.
304940	eng	It is cruel of them to make the boy work so hard.
304941	eng	It was not clear whether they had accomplished it or not.
304942	eng	If only they hadn't done that, I might have been able to get somewhere.
304943	eng	It is strange that they should get so angry.
304944	eng	It seems strange that they feel so angry.
304945	eng	When I saw them on a date, I asked them, "Do I hear wedding bells?"
304946	eng	It is a mystery how they escaped from prison.
304947	eng	The step they took provided at best a temporary solution to the problem.
304948	eng	We didn't know what train they'd be on.
304949	eng	I cannot understand why they are such good friends: they have little in common.
304950	eng	I don't know why they are so steamed off at us.
304952	eng	I took it for granted that they adored Hannah.
304953	eng	They seldom, if ever, speak in French.
304954	eng	Ask him whether they still live in Tokyo.
304955	eng	Not all of them are happy.
304956	eng	I like all of them.
304957	eng	All of them are not poor.
304958	eng	Between them they can finish in a week.
304959	eng	I've been expecting good news from them.
304960	eng	There was not a single word of gratitude from them.
304961	eng	We had a lot of spontaneous offers from them.
304962	eng	We received a cordial welcome from them.
304964	eng	Ascertain whether they are safe or not.
304965	eng	It is surprising that they should have a second house in America.
304966	eng	To see them sitting together, you'd take them for twins.
304967	eng	I saw them play baseball in the playground.
304968	eng	It is doubtful whether they will be able to swim.
304969	eng	The train had already left when they got to the station.
304971	eng	When they got to the station, the train had already left.
304972	eng	I don't care about what they say.
304973	eng	It is important that he find out what they are doing.
304975	eng	It was before dawn that they got the fire under control.
304976	eng	It was inevitable that they would meet.
304977	eng	There are many problems for them to deal with.
304978	eng	There is little hope that they are alive.
304979	eng	It goes without saying that they are in the wrong.
304980	eng	I will telephone you as soon as they return.
304981	eng	I'll wait here until they come back.
304982	eng	It's Spain that they are going to on holiday.
304983	eng	It is good for them to work during their vacation.
304984	eng	They were stupid not to follow your advice.
304985	eng	Tell me the reason why they are absent.
304986	eng	There can be no doubt about their marriage.
304987	eng	The news of their marriage spread throughout the village.
304988	eng	They got married only recently.
304989	eng	When they got married, they both swore to never lie.
304990	eng	They have been married for four years.
304991	eng	I think they have been married for five years.
304992	eng	They have only been married two months.
304993	eng	Do you know how long they have been married?
304994	eng	When they said they were going to get married, it blew my mind.
304995	eng	The rumor that they would get married spread at once.
304996	eng	They stayed married for the sake of their children.
304997	eng	Here is a new video for them to watch.
304998	eng	I watched them destroy the old building.
304999	eng	The stock they sold buyers was a lemon.
305001	eng	The research done by them shows that Americans are not interested in Japan.
305002	eng	There was some monkey business going on when they were negotiating that last contract; money passed under the table.
305003	eng	They were through with work.
305005	eng	The idea they put to us fell in exactly with what we ourselves had in mind.
305007	eng	I was not aware of the danger until they warned me.
305008	eng	His story doesn't agree with what they have said to me.
305009	eng	I spoke slowly so that they might understand me.
305010	eng	Have you ever known them to come on time?
305011	eng	What does it matter how they bring up their own children?
305012	eng	Who will look after the baby while they're out?
305013	eng	The dinner they served was badly cooked.
305014	eng	They had hardly started when it began to rain.
305015	eng	We do not anticipate their buying a new car.
305016	eng	Were they busy last week?
305017	eng	You must take action for their early release.
305018	eng	You know how crazy they are over their little bundle of joy.
305020	eng	It was my fault that they came late.
305021	eng	Make sure that they come here late.
305022	eng	I feel in my bones that they will never get along well together.
305023	eng	The precise time of their arrival is not known.
305024	eng	Ten minutes after they had passed Nara, the car ran out of gas.
305025	eng	It is five years since they came to Japan.
305026	eng	The manual they asked him to read was two inches thick.
305027	eng	No wonder they have elected him chairman.
305028	eng	They are hugging and kissing.
305029	eng	They may properly claim the protection of the law.
305030	eng	They welcomed me warmly, so I felt at home.
305031	eng	I took the wheel while he slept.
305032	eng	Don't interpret their silence as obedience.
305033	eng	When they woke up they saw a stone lying next to them.
305034	eng	I hope they don't resort to violence to accomplish their goals.
305035	eng	Until they came back, she had been busy.
305036	eng	I shouldn't wonder if they came after all.
305037	eng	What a blessing it is that they did not come.
305038	eng	It will be some time before they come.
305039	eng	A party of scientists were on board with them.
305040	eng	It is vain to argue with them about the problem.
305041	eng	My association with them didn't last long.
305042	eng	I can't fit in with them.
305043	eng	Don't associate with them.
305044	eng	They talk a lot to one another, over the telephone and in person.
305045	eng	I concurred with them in giving him the prize.
305046	eng	You have to hurry if you want to go with them.
305047	eng	Laugh with them.
305048	eng	I am working with them towards world peace.
305049	eng	It's no use bandying words with them.
305051	eng	He went at them with his fists.
305052	eng	Anything you could do in support of their effort would be very much appreciated.
305053	eng	They scarcely need it at all.
305054	eng	They have seen better days.
305055	eng	Queer rumors about them were in the air.
305056	eng	It's important for them to go out.
305057	eng	They have nowhere else to go.
305058	eng	They have a lot in common.
305059	eng	They have nothing to complain about.
305060	eng	They have a ten-year-old son.
305061	eng	They have two sons and one daughter.
305062	eng	They had two daughters, who became famous pianists.
305063	eng	They have the right to do so.
305064	eng	They have little chance to practice it.
305065	eng	I haven't seen them anywhere.
305066	eng	They hardly have any time left.
305067	eng	They have no house to live in at all.
305068	eng	They have something in common with each other.
305069	eng	They are wanting in industry.
305070	eng	They have no sense of sin.
305071	eng	Since they had no children of their own, they decided to adopt a little girl.
305072	eng	They had only one child.
305073	eng	They have enough capital to build a second factory.
305074	eng	They have but the shadow of freedom.
305075	eng	They had no house in which to live.
305076	eng	They have not less than ten children.
305077	eng	They did not have much food to eat.
305078	eng	They had no food.
305079	eng	They are free from care.
305080	eng	They have twin daughters.
305082	eng	They have their own troubles.
305084	eng	They have two daughters.
305085	eng	They had a lot of children to provide for.
305086	eng	They require extra help.
305087	eng	I told them again to turn down the radio.
305088	eng	I want to ask them when their big day is.
305089	eng	They have no claim to the property.
305090	eng	A child was born to them.
305091	eng	I could not make myself understood to them in English.
305092	eng	I'll have to make amends to them for my mistake.
305093	eng	I'll have them repair my car.
305094	eng	May the blessing of God be upon them.
305095	eng	A baby was born to them.
305096	eng	They had a baby last week.
305097	eng	I'm considering going with them.
305098	eng	I walked quietly so that they would not hear me.
305099	eng	He stopped to talk to them.
305100	eng	He stopped talking to them.
305101	eng	Three quarters of them agreed.
305102	eng	Their only son has been dead for three years.
305103	eng	They broke up after 7 years of marriage.
305104	eng	I overheard their mockery.
305105	eng	None of them were present at the meeting.
305106	eng	Over ten percent of them can do the work.
305107	eng	Two of them were drowned.
305108	eng	The three of them were the only ones to apologize to her.
305109	eng	Which of them is your brother?
305110	eng	Which of them can sing better?
305111	eng	I hope that neither of them was involved in the traffic accident.
305112	eng	Some of them are my friends.
305113	eng	How many of them survived is not known.
305114	eng	Several of them are opposed to the bill.
305115	eng	None of them are present.
305116	eng	None of them could understand what she was implying.
305117	eng	Their climbing of Mt. Everest was a great achievement.
305118	eng	Thanks to them, I got well at last.
305119	eng	Join me with them in their movement.
305120	eng	There are many factors behind the quarrel between them.
305121	eng	There is no telling how long their quarrel will last.
305122	eng	Their quarrel sprung from misunderstanding.
305123	eng	Let them take care of themselves.
305125	eng	Their concert was a big hit.
305126	eng	Follow close behind them.
305128	eng	Their first fall there was a trial for them.
305129	eng	We are three points ahead of their team.
305130	eng	Their team doesn't have a ghost of a chance of winning this season.
305131	eng	Their team's name is NWO.
305132	eng	Shall I carry coffee to them?
305133	eng	Their boat needs painting.
305134	eng	I think most of them took part in the plot.
305135	eng	I guess most of them went home.
305136	eng	They are mostly polite.
305137	eng	It is your business to take care of them.
305138	eng	Even after being approved, difficulties might arise in the actual construction of the line.
305139	eng	Each of their opinions has both good points and bad points.
305140	eng	Their opinion matters little.
305141	eng	Their opinions differ from mine.
305142	eng	It took us a week to locate their hideaway.
305143	eng	The warmth of their welcome made me happy.
305144	eng	Some of them said yes, and the others said no.
305146	eng	They were very kind to me when I was at their house.
305147	eng	Their dining room is very spacious.
305148	eng	Their house was burned down in the fire.
305149	eng	Their house is far from the station.
305150	eng	Their house is being remodeled.
305151	eng	Theirs is an old family.
305152	eng	Their house is off the map, miles away from the nearest town.
305153	eng	Stone was used to build their houses.
305154	eng	Their furniture was chosen for utility rather than style.
305155	eng	Their furniture is more aesthetic than practical.
305156	eng	Their home is abundant in love and laughter.
305157	eng	Their assignments were handed in on September 1st.
305158	eng	Their patience was about to give out.
305159	eng	Their conversation being in Chinese, I was not able to understand them at all.
305160	eng	Their conversation went on.
305161	eng	Their conversation was carried on for about an hour.
305162	eng	Their school and ours are sister schools.
305163	eng	Their bags were checked by security guards at the gate.
305164	eng	A fight started about nothing between them.
305165	eng	There is a generation gap between them.
305166	eng	A harmony prevailed among them.
305167	eng	I hope their relationship will blossom into something permanent.
305168	eng	From the way they look, I would say that they failed.
305169	eng	Though I have done nothing against them, they think ill of me.
305170	eng	Their argument seemed endless.
305171	eng	Their living room is as large again as my house.
305172	eng	In the teeth of their strong opposition, we carried out our plan.
305173	eng	Their muscles are stiff.
305174	eng	Their contract is to run out at the end of this month.
305175	eng	I have doubts about the success of their plan.
305176	eng	I do not think their plan will work out.
305177	eng	Their plan resulted in failure.
305178	eng	I am quite ignorant of their plan.
305179	eng	Their plan sounds interesting to me.
305180	eng	Their decision will bring about serious consequences.
305181	eng	I was invited to their wedding.
305182	eng	Have you been invited to their wedding?
305183	eng	Their marriage ceremony was performed according to the custom of the district.
305184	eng	Their wedding will be tomorrow.
305185	eng	Their married life did not run smoothly.
305186	eng	I hear their marriage is on the rocks and they'll probably file for divorce soon.
305187	eng	Their marriage broke up last year.
305188	eng	Their married life was full bliss.
305189	eng	Their expenses for the wedding were considerable.
305191	eng	Their blood will be distributed to many people.
305193	eng	Their dog was so fierce that he kept everyone away.
305194	eng	It is not clearly stated in their study if the patients overcame this syndrome during the therapy.
305195	eng	Their excuses were all alike.
305196	eng	You had better do what they say.
305197	eng	It is silly of you to trust them.
305198	eng	As their language had no written form, the natives expressed deeds and events in carvings.
305199	eng	Their employees live in.
305200	eng	They heard a noise behind them.
305201	eng	Their curiosity was aroused.
305202	eng	We prayed for their happiness.
305203	eng	Their happiness was rooted in their industry.
305204	eng	Their ideas seem totally alien to us.
305205	eng	You must take their ideas into account.
305206	eng	Their way of thinking is behind the times.
305207	eng	I was quite taken aback at their bad manners.
305208	eng	Their highest skill was woodworking.
305209	eng	Their finest moment is their last appearance on stage.
305210	eng	You can't judge their works by the same standards.
305211	eng	Their job is to exterminate rats and mice.
305212	eng	Their manner of bringing up their children is extremely unusual.
305213	eng	There is a community of thought between them.
305215	eng	Their business is expanding.
305216	eng	Their business came to a standstill for want of money.
305217	eng	A lot of their time is spent on part-time jobs.
305218	eng	I resent his rude attitude.
305219	eng	Their car overtook ours.
305220	eng	Their main exports are textiles, especially silk and cotton.
305221	eng	I will have to help them.
305222	eng	Their hobby is fishing.
305223	eng	But for their help, we could not have succeeded.
305224	eng	There is no need to call in their assistance.
305225	eng	Their small protest triggered a mass demonstration.
305226	eng	Their boss made them work against their will.
305227	eng	Their coats were uniform in color.
305228	eng	In their case, it was love at first sight.
305229	eng	Their lips met.
305230	eng	Their offer cuts both ways.
305231	eng	I was moved by their kindness.
305232	eng	Their intimacy grew with the years.
305233	eng	What happened to them is still a mystery.
305234	eng	They have a growing population; therefore they need more and more food.
305235	eng	Their view of life may appear strange.
305236	eng	They are not much different in character from each other.
305237	eng	Their success has a lot to do with their diligence.
305238	eng	Are you in favor of their policy?
305239	eng	Their lifestyle is different to ours.
305240	eng	They like to look back on old times.
305241	eng	Their baby has just started to crawl.
305242	eng	Their ship struck a rock.
305243	eng	Their ship was at the mercy of the waves.
305244	eng	There was a long winter before them.
305245	eng	No one gave up hope.
305246	eng	Not all of them are present at the meeting today.
305247	eng	The dispute between them is due to misunderstanding.
305248	eng	Their son's name is John.
305249	eng	Their boy was named Edward.
305250	eng	Their son grew bigger.
305251	eng	Their losses reached one million yen.
305252	eng	Many of them were kind to us.
305253	eng	They were for the most part young people.
305254	eng	They were for the most part high school students.
305255	eng	They were mostly women.
305256	eng	They were, for the most part, college students.
305257	eng	Who is their homeroom teacher?
305258	eng	Problems are expected in their expedition.
305259	eng	I anticipate that there will be problems on their expedition.
305260	eng	Their clothes are quite like those of our ancestors.
305261	eng	I can never pick him out among them.
305262	eng	Some of them are healthy, but others are not healthy.
305263	eng	Some of them are healthy, but others are not.
305264	eng	Some of them had a gift for making weapons.
305266	eng	The report proved true as a result of their investigation.
305267	eng	Their garden is full of very beautiful flowers all the year round.
305268	eng	Their proposition is contrary to ours.
305269	eng	Their proposal is out of the question.
305270	eng	Their traditional life style no longer exists.
305271	eng	We cannot help admiring their effort.
305272	eng	All their efforts were in vain.
305273	eng	Their efforts came to nothing.
305274	eng	Their effort proved abortive.
305275	eng	Their efforts made the situation better to a certain degree.
305276	eng	Their efforts were not for nothing.
305277	eng	Their late arrival was owing to the rain.
305278	eng	Please tell me the precise time of their arrival.
305279	eng	The battle ended before they got there.
305280	eng	Their flight was discovered yesterday.
305282	eng	They lost their way; otherwise, they would have arrived long ago.
305284	eng	The difference in their ages is six years.
305285	eng	Their farms adjoin.
305286	eng	A fire broke out at the inn where they were staying.
305287	eng	They are conventional in their judgement.
305288	eng	Their opposition broke down.
305289	eng	They reveled in the success of their sales.
305290	eng	All their secrets have been revealed.
305291	eng	Their secret was laid bare.
305292	eng	Their estimate of the cost was wide of the mark.
305293	eng	Their plane will soon take off.
305294	eng	Their complaints filled me with anger.
305295	eng	Their father is a taxi driver.
305296	eng	Their father had a large shoe shop in the town.
305297	eng	Their manners and customs are different from those of this country.
305298	eng	They were hindered in their study.
305299	eng	Their reports don't accord.
305301	eng	Their nationalism was one cause of the war.
305302	eng	Their dreams came true.
305303	eng	Informed of their safety, the premier breathed a sigh of relief.
305304	eng	Their names escaped me.
305305	eng	Their names have already been signed.
305306	eng	Their names are Tom and Ken.
305307	eng	Their names were erased from the list.
305308	eng	They blotted out my name from the list.
305309	eng	Their eyes pursued him.
305310	eng	Their eyes were all bright.
305311	eng	None of their promises have been kept.
305312	eng	By degrees their friendship grew into love.
305313	eng	Their friendship ripened into a deep love.
305314	eng	Don't give way to their request.
305315	eng	You mustn't give in to their demands.
305316	eng	The school authorities started to take action at their request.
305317	eng	Their divorce is much talked about in their neighborhood.

307655	eng	They went on putting aside fallen stones.
307656	eng	They were on the lookout for a storm.
307657	eng	They allotted the profits fairly.
307658	eng	They are maneuvering behind the scene.

307682	eng	They believe that the soul is immortal.
307683	eng	They waited in line for the bus.

307685	eng	They have lost 10 games in a row since their winning streak ended.
307686	eng	They scrambled for the penny in the street.
307687	eng	They stood on the balcony to watch the festival in the street below.
307688	eng	They are demanding shorter working hours.
307689	eng	They guaranteed regular employment to their workers.
307690	eng	They will organize a labor union.
307691	eng	They failed to take into account the special needs of old people.
307692	eng	They sued for peace.
307693	eng	They can think and speak.
307694	eng	They stopped to talk.
307696	eng	They were cut off in the middle of their telephone conversation.
307698	eng	They are not of above taking bribes.
307699	eng	They bribed the witness into silence.
307700	eng	They came walking arm in arm.
307701	eng	They walked along the avenue, arm in arm.
307702	eng	They were walking along the street arm in arm.
307703	eng	They're eating high on the hog.
307704	eng	I bought them each a present.
307706	eng	They'll give in to us some day.
307707	eng	They may yet be happy.
307708	eng	Are they coming as well?
307709	eng	Do you mind their coming too?
307710	eng	Don't make fun of them.
307711	eng	We practiced very hard to beat them.
307712	eng	It is our duty to help them.
307713	eng	He gave me authority to fire them.
307714	eng	They had to be turned away from the theater.
307715	eng	There's no need to see them off.
307716	eng	Will you help them?
307717	eng	Can you put them on the witness stand?
307718	eng	It is absurd to try to persuade them.
307719	eng	Let them come in.
307720	eng	Don't you like them any at all?
307721	eng	They love each other.
307725	eng	They look down on us as inexperienced young men.
307726	eng	They died one after another.
307727	eng	They did not know it themselves.
307729	eng	Although they are twins, they have few interests in common.
307730	eng	They are mere creatures of habit.
307731	eng	They are very compatible.
307732	eng	It seems a bit feudal to call him "sir".
307733	eng	Shall I have him go with you?
307734	eng	You ought not to treat him like that.
307735	eng	You may call him a liar, but you cannot call him a bad man.
307736	eng	If you flatter him, he'll do anything.
307737	eng	It is impudent of you to jest at him.
307738	eng	You should not make fun of him.
307739	eng	I can't help making fun of him.
307740	eng	He shall not come into this house again.
307741	eng	Did you know him?
307742	eng	He shall be scolded.
307743	eng	There is no one that knows him who speaks ill of him.
307745	eng	Please let him come at once.
307746	eng	It was decided that he should be sent for at once.
307747	eng	He shall go at once.
307749	eng	Let's call him Snoopy.
307750	eng	He shan't go there.
307752	eng	Don't blame him for the error.
307753	eng	I regard him as the best person for the job.
307754	eng	We have no call to appoint him to the post.
307755	eng	Dismiss him from that post.
307756	eng	I accommodated him for the night.
307757	eng	Nobody knows what it is that has been bothering him so much.
307758	eng	Don't take him in.
307759	eng	Have him wait a moment.
307760	eng	I caught a glimpse of him.
307761	eng	I must help him.
307762	eng	What do you make of him?
307763	eng	I feel like telling him what I think of him.
307764	eng	Don't stop him.
307765	eng	The Stars must be kicking themselves for giving him the boot.
307766	eng	We cannot praise him too much.
307768	eng	Quiet him down, will you?
307769	eng	I didn't invite him to the party. I feel guilty about it.
307770	eng	I went all the way to see him only to find him not at home.
307771	eng	I planned to introduce him to Beatrice.
307772	eng	There was no one but admired him.
307773	eng	Cornering him in an argument is easy - like taking candy from a baby.
307774	eng	Watch him and do likewise.
307775	eng	Keep a close eye on him.
307776	eng	All the more so to think well of him.
307777	eng	Whoever knows him well respects him.
307778	eng	I don't pretend to love him.
307780	eng	I accommodated him with a night's lodging.
307782	eng	It is incumbent on us to support him.
307784	eng	I managed to bring him around to my way of thinking.
307785	eng	We failed to bring him to agree to our plan.
307786	eng	There is a good argument for dismissing him.
307788	eng	I can't pretend to like him.
307789	eng	I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
307790	eng	Let's receive him with a happy smile.
307791	eng	We did not move for fear we should wake him up.
307792	eng	It never occurred to me to doubt him.
307793	eng	You may call him a fool, but you cannot call him a coward.
307794	eng	I saw him off at the airport.
307795	eng	We gave him a royal send-off at the airport.
307796	eng	You'd better not make light of him.
307797	eng	Go and meet him, and while you're about it mail this letter.
307798	eng	I could not help laughing when I saw him.
307799	eng	As soon as I saw him, I burst into laughter.
307800	eng	The instant I saw him I knew he was angry.
307801	eng	I don't see him.
307802	eng	Look at him. He's drunk again.
307803	eng	Every time I looked at him, he was yawning.
307804	eng	To look at him, you couldn't help laughing.
307805	eng	I cannot help but sympathize with him any time I see him.
307806	eng	I never see him without thinking of my son.
307807	eng	The moment I saw him, I knew he was angry.
307808	eng	The instant I saw him, I knew he was ill.
307809	eng	He reminds me of my grandfather.
307810	eng	I cannot see him without thinking of my brother.
307811	eng	I don't want to see him, let alone go out with him.
307812	eng	Able was I ere I saw him.
307814	eng	To look at him, you could hardly believe it.
307818	eng	I have been to the airport to see him off.
307820	eng	Keep watch on him.
307821	eng	I inquired after him.
307822	eng	Employing him would amount to employing nobody.
307823	eng	When you employ him, you must make allowances for his youth.
307824	eng	His age didn't enter into our decision not to employ him.
307825	eng	If you treat him fairly, he will be fair with you.
307827	eng	To do him justice, he is not stupid.
307828	eng	It's not that I seriously like him. I just find him very attractive.
307829	eng	It stands to reason that nobody likes him. He's too mean.
307830	eng	Some people like him and other people don't.
307831	eng	I could hardly keep from liking him.
307832	eng	Can any girl like him?
307834	eng	What's the accusation against him?
307837	eng	I made believe that I supported him.
307838	eng	We thought it impossible to stop him.
307839	eng	We adopt him as our representative.
307840	eng	Follow his example.
307841	eng	He shall be fired.
307843	eng	Do you hold him in great account?
307844	eng	Outside of him, no one else came to the party.
307845	eng	I feel kind of sorry for him.
307846	eng	You ought to have invited him, but you didn't.
307847	eng	There was no one who did not admire him.
307848	eng	It makes him a laughingstock.
307850	eng	It was stupid of you to believe in him.
307851	eng	It is stupid of you to believe in him.
307853	eng	You should have known better than to trust him.
307854	eng	You ought not to believe him.
307855	eng	You can't trust him.
307857	eng	You should not trust him.
307858	eng	Don't trust him.
307859	eng	You are very silly to trust him.
307860	eng	I erred in thinking him trustworthy.
307861	eng	In believing him to be an honest man, I was seriously in error.
307862	eng	I tried to talk him out of the project, but in vain.
307863	eng	I convinced him of his fault.
307864	eng	We couldn't get anywhere in our attempt to convince him.
307865	eng	I don't see any point in persuading him.
307866	eng	I figure that there is no point in trying to persuade him.
307867	eng	I wish I could have persuaded him to join us.
307868	eng	It took a long time to bring him around to our point of view.
307869	eng	I had a hard time trying to talk him out of taking the trip.
307870	eng	It is no use trying to persuade him.
307871	eng	There's no use trying to persuade him.
307872	eng	It is absurd trying to persuade him.
307873	eng	You're the only person that can persuade him.
307874	eng	It is difficult, if not impossible, to persuade him.
307875	eng	We found it impossible to persuade him.
307877	eng	We have no trust in him.
307878	eng	Some of his students admired him, and others despised him.
307880	eng	He is inclined to start at once, without waiting for him.
307881	eng	I am inclined to wait for him and start.
307882	eng	There was nothing that I could do but wait for him.
307883	eng	All we can do is wait for him.
307884	eng	All we can do is to wait for him.
307886	eng	There is no possibility of our finding him.
307887	eng	Whether you know him or not, you have to support his opinion.
307888	eng	Do I know him?
307889	eng	All who knew him admired him.
307890	eng	Those who know him speak well of him.
307891	eng	Who that knows him will believe it?
307892	eng	Not knowing him, I asked my sister about his job.
307893	eng	The more I know him, the more I like him.
307894	eng	Show him in.
307895	eng	Bring him in.
307896	eng	Give him time.
307897	eng	I went after him, but I lost him in the crowd.
307898	eng	Through him I got acquainted with the big names of the town.
307899	eng	Don't make an enemy of him.
307900	eng	It is no exaggeration to call him a genius.
307901	eng	Would you mind calling him to the phone?
307902	eng	I called him to the telephone.
307903	eng	Try not to make him angry.
307904	eng	I didn't say a word for fear I should annoy him.
307905	eng	You must not shout at him.
307906	eng	You can rely upon him.
307907	eng	I gave no answer for fear I should confuse him.
307908	eng	There are six people including him.
307909	eng	Nothing but a full apology would satisfy him.
307911	eng	It is not his illness that ruined him so much as his idleness.
307912	eng	Don't make a fool of him.
307913	eng	Don't call those students fools.
307914	eng	Don't call him the criminal.
307915	eng	You can't mistake him for his younger brother.
307916	eng	Few, if any, will criticize him.
307917	eng	You ought to walk a mile in his shoes before you criticize him.
307918	eng	It was wise of you to keep away from him.
307919	eng	His repeated delinquencies brought him to court.
307920	eng	I am far from blaming him.
307921	eng	It is inevitable even if he is criticized.
307923	eng	I must hasten to add that I do not mean to blame him.
307924	eng	You take him to the hospital.
307925	eng	Could I ask you to drive him to the hospital?
307926	eng	I spoke to him kindly so as not to frighten him.
307927	eng	I doubt if he is a lawyer.
307928	eng	They buried him in his grave.
307929	eng	I can't let him alone.
307930	eng	When I called on him, he was hard at work.
307931	eng	I couldn't bring myself to call on him.
307932	eng	When I called on him, he was not at home.
307933	eng	I was welcomed whenever I visited him.
307934	eng	I expected that I would visit him, but I couldn't.
307935	eng	It's hard to please him.
307936	eng	Don't arouse him from his sleep!
307937	eng	He reported fully what he had seen to the police.
307938	eng	There wasn't enough evidence to convict him of the crime.
307939	eng	You should seclude him from temptation.
307940	eng	Nobody ever praises him.
307941	eng	It is up to you to support him.
307942	eng	It is very difficult to make him out.
307943	eng	Who should write it but himself?
307944	eng	Everybody except him thanked the critic for her honest opinion.
307945	eng	All but for he are here.
307947	eng	He's an odd man; so we'll have him referee.
307949	eng	His powerful speech carried the audience with him.
307951	eng	He himself said so.
307952	eng	He himself went there.
307953	eng	He himself did it.
307954	eng	She was taken in by his manners.
307955	eng	What's wrong with her? She's looking kind of blue.
307956	eng	She looks as if nothing had happened to her.
307957	eng	She has a husband and two daughters.
307958	eng	She seems down lately.
307959	eng	Her dress has an understated charm.
307960	eng	Who do you think she is?
307961	eng	She is beautiful and how!
307962	eng	She gets lost really easily. She's got no sense of direction.
307963	eng	Can she get the law degree?
307964	eng	No matter how often you write to her, she will not take notice of you.
307965	eng	There's no way she'll ever marry Sato.
307966	eng	The reason she killed herself is unknown.
307967	eng	She is able to speak ten languages.
307968	eng	See if you can catch the word she uses as she describes how she begins her day.
307969	eng	She is leading by two meters.
307970	eng	She cannot be over thirty.
307971	eng	She can't be over thirty; she must still be in her twenties.
307972	eng	She may well refuse to speak to you because she's in a very bad mood.
307973	eng	Is she your teacher?
307974	eng	There is no reason for her to scold you.
307975	eng	In that pink dress, she was it.
307976	eng	It was clear that she was not concerned with the matter.
307977	eng	Why is it that she was at the mercy of that friend of hers?
307978	eng	That she grew up in America is well-known.
307979	eng	I took her for an American.
307980	eng	I heard her speaking English as fluently as a citizen of the USA.
307981	eng	I am surprised that she should have changed so much.
307982	eng	Do you know the reason why she is so angry?
307983	eng	It's strange that she should have come home so late at night.
307984	eng	She spoke too quickly, so I couldn't understand.
307985	eng	She gave me some good advice.
307986	eng	It is surprising how little she knows of the world.
307987	eng	Try as she may, she is unable to beat him.
307988	eng	I really don't understand what's up with her.
307989	eng	It is not clear when and where she was born.
307990	eng	I don't know when she will leave for London.
307991	eng	Who cares when she will marry?
307992	eng	Whenever she may come, I am ready to welcome her.
307993	eng	Do you know when she will come?
307994	eng	It's anybody's guess when she'll come.
307995	eng	I miss her so much.
307996	eng	It's not as though the world is going to end if she leaves.
307997	eng	He will be angry to learn that she told a lie.
307998	eng	It became clear that she'd told a lie.
307999	eng	She cannot have told a lie.
308000	eng	I was angry that she had deceived my children.
308001	eng	She may well feel unhappy.
308002	eng	Why don't you just call a spade a spade and admit that she dumped you for that American guy she met at the English school?
308003	eng	She was a sight when she didn't wear makeup.
308004	eng	Scarcely had she put on her makeup before he arrived.
308005	eng	Hardly had she got in the bath when the postman knocked on the door with a parcel.
308006	eng	You must be careful that she doesn't fall over the cliff.
308007	eng	It is not rare that she leaves her umbrella behind.
308008	eng	When she lit the gas, there was a loud explosion.
308009	eng	She played the guitar and he sang.
308010	eng	I heard that she came here.
308012	eng	Did you know she is good at making coffee?
308013	eng	It's exciting to watch her run after a cockroach.
308014	eng	I'm sorry she's not here.
308015	eng	Let's suppose that she is here.
308016	eng	If only she were here, she would tell me what to do.
308017	eng	It doesn't matter to me whether she comes here or not.
308018	eng	A year has passed since she came here.
308019	eng	I saw her coming up the road.
308020	eng	She will show you around this town.
308021	eng	It is deplorable that she is so selfish.
308022	eng	Her mother has made her what she is.
308023	eng	Never was she so frightened.
308024	eng	She cannot be here so early.
308025	eng	That she behaves this way is odd.
308027	eng	She married John, not because she loved him, but because he was a rich man.
308028	eng	Everybody knew that she was being pushy.
308029	eng	She will soon clear away these dishes.
308030	eng	We hope she will take heart soon.
308031	eng	There is little hope of her getting well soon.
308032	eng	I hope that she'll get well soon.
308033	eng	It goes without saying that she is an excellent pianist.
308034	eng	She may well say so.
308035	eng	It was quite right of her to do that.
308036	eng	It is quite strange that she should say so.
308038	eng	It was surprising that she said that.
308040	eng	She can't have said so.
308041	eng	She came out of there.
308042	eng	It was a camera that she bought there.
308043	eng	That she was there is certain.
308044	eng	By the time she gets there, it will be nearly dark.
308046	eng	By the time you get out of prison, she'll have been married.
308047	eng	She reported the news.
308048	eng	She can't have done such a thing.
308049	eng	She can not have said such a thing.
308050	eng	I often heard her sing that song.
308051	eng	It took a whole day to paint the picture.
308052	eng	Nobody knows what has become of her.
308053	eng	She looked after the child.
308054	eng	Great was her surprise when she knew the fact.
308055	eng	It is no wonder that she was given the prize.
308056	eng	She may well be pleased with the success.
308057	eng	The baby had been crying for an hour when she found it.
308058	eng	I thought it difficult for her to get the ticket.
308059	eng	Seeing that she was not excited at the news, she must have known it.
308060	eng	She may have been surprised when she heard the news.
308061	eng	She may well be beside herself with joy at the news.
308062	eng	No one doubts her fitness for the post.
308063	eng	It will take her at least two years to be qualified for that post.
308064	eng	She bought a book at the shop.
308065	eng	Her implication in the crime was obvious.
308066	eng	It beats me how she could have gotten that secret information.
308067	eng	She had hardly begun to read the book before someone knocked at the door.
308068	eng	It's surprising that she doesn't know anything about it.
308069	eng	You can't deny the fact that she had a hand in it.
308070	eng	She cannot have done it.
308071	eng	The time will come when she will repent of it.
308072	eng	It is strange that she should do such a thing.
308073	eng	It is curious that she should have asked you such a thing.
308074	eng	She cannot have done such a thing.
308075	eng	It is surprising that she should say so.
308076	eng	She cannot have said that.
308077	eng	Don't you think it odd that she was in such a hurry?
308078	eng	I can't bear that she should suffer so.
308079	eng	It is strange that she should go home so early.
308080	eng	I am surprised that she refused such a good offer.
308081	eng	It is careless of her to make such a mistake.
308082	eng	It is strange that she should say such a thing.
308083	eng	She can't have said such a thing.
308084	eng	I wish that she would stop smoking.
308085	eng	Do you know who she is?
308086	eng	She was just about to take a bath when the bell rang.
308087	eng	She will clear the table of the dishes.
308088	eng	I feel badly that she failed her test.
308089	eng	Hardly had she opened the door when a white dog rushed out of the house.
308090	eng	No sooner had she opened the door than a cat ran out.
308091	eng	He had no idea as to what she had in mind.
308092	eng	I didn't know the reason why she began to cry.
308093	eng	How did you get to know she was ill?
308094	eng	Do you know where he was born?
308095	eng	I know where she is.
308096	eng	Do you know where she is?
308097	eng	No one could tell where she was.
308099	eng	Tell me where she lives.
308100	eng	Do you know where she lives?
308101	eng	Do you happen to know where she lives?
308102	eng	It beats me where she's gone.
308103	eng	Wherever she goes, her child follows her.
308104	eng	It happened that he appeared when she couldn't decide which way to go.
308105	eng	Since she was wearing the very strange hat, people teased her.
308106	eng	To her great disappointment, it rained on the day of the picnic.
308107	eng	I feel a strong affinity for her.
308108	eng	However hard she tried, she was unable to please him.
308109	eng	I did not notice how glad she was.
308110	eng	You cannot imagine how happy she was.
308111	eng	You have no idea how distressed she was.
308112	eng	Try as she may, she will not be able to please him.
308113	eng	I wonder why she is so worried.
308114	eng	I know the reason that she quit her job.
308115	eng	It is still a mystery why she killed herself.
308116	eng	He completely failed to understand why she got angry.
308117	eng	Whatever she may say, I will not attend the meeting.
308118	eng	Do you remember what she said?
308119	eng	She cannot have seen me at the party.
308120	eng	Few people noticed her absence from the party.
308121	eng	It's too bad she can't come to the party.
308122	eng	Her debut was the biggest social event of the season.
308123	eng	I noticed her the moment she got off the bus.
308124	eng	The day she started for Paris was rainy.
308125	eng	She will accompany me on the piano.
308126	eng	She was heard to sing to the piano.
308128	eng	I saw her play the piano.
308129	eng	She was playing the piano when the guests arrived.
308130	eng	I often hear her play the piano.
308131	eng	Have you ever heard her play the piano?
308133	eng	She seldom, if ever, goes to movies by herself.
308134	eng	I don't know whether she likes her coffee black.
308135	eng	It is true that she teaches French.
308136	eng	She is tossing and turning in bed.
308137	eng	Her continuous chatter vexes me.
308138	eng	I don't know if she will go there with me.
308139	eng	It never occurred to me that she loved me.
308140	eng	He could hardly comprehend what she was implying.
308141	eng	Just as she was about to leave the store, she saw a beautiful dress in the window.
308142	eng	We must make allowances for her youth.
308143	eng	I was annoyed that she was still asleep.
308144	eng	I find it strange that she hasn't arrived yet.
308146	eng	I have heard say that she will get married before long.
308147	eng	He asked me whether she was coming.
308148	eng	She was ready to jump ship.
308149	eng	She gave me charming embroideries.
308150	eng	I want to get the book back from her.
308151	eng	I hear from her once in a while.
308152	eng	Her financial support is indispensable to this project of ours.
308153	eng	I found her letter in the mailbox.
308154	eng	I am expecting a letter from her.
308155	eng	Her answer couldn't be understood.
308156	eng	I would be very happy to hear from her.
308157	eng	I have seldom heard from her.
308158	eng	She sent you her best wishes.
308159	eng	I have not heard from her for a month.
308160	eng	I had a call from her for the first time in a long time.
308161	eng	I received a letter from her to the effect that she couldn't accept my marriage proposal.
308163	eng	I had a telephone call from her.
308164	eng	I was in the middle of reading when I had a call from her.
308166	eng	Have you heard from her?
308167	eng	When he saw her letter, he felt somewhat uneasy.
308168	eng	She brought apples, oranges, and so on.
308169	eng	It took a long time for her to write the report.
308170	eng	I was amazed that she had drunk all of the wine.
308171	eng	It is remarkable for her not to understand.
308172	eng	She broke into tears.
308173	eng	She works so hard that she can get good results.
308174	eng	She loves Tom, not me.
308175	eng	It's you that she loves, not me.
308176	eng	She acted as a guide.
308177	eng	After she picked up the first glass and water went all over the place, she called the boss out.
308178	eng	The thought of her going alone left me uneasy.
308179	eng	It is not good for her to live alone.
308180	eng	She may well be proud of her only son.
308181	eng	It is no accident that she won the first prize.
308182	eng	It became clear that she had told a lie.
308183	eng	Her facility with English is wonderful.
308184	eng	Everybody knew she could speak English well.
308185	eng	Have you heard her speaking English?
308186	eng	To hear her speak English, you would take her for an Englishwoman.
308187	eng	If you heard her speak English, you would take her for an American.
308188	eng	Do you know whether she can speak English?
308189	eng	When she looked, he shut the door and locked her into the totally dark closet.
308190	eng	He was very glad when she offered to help him fix his roof.
308191	eng	Do you know what she said?
308192	eng	It was not clear what she said.
308193	eng	I think it strange that she didn't say anything.
308194	eng	Ask her what she has done.
308195	eng	I do not know for certain what she is going to do.
308196	eng	I don't know for certain what she is going to do.
308197	eng	I had no idea of what she intended to do.
308199	eng	It wasn't clear what she meant.
308200	eng	Don't lose your head whatever she says.
308201	eng	It makes no difference what she said.
308203	eng	Ask her what she bought.
308204	eng	I found out where she was.
308205	eng	She cared for the children out of charity.
308206	eng	Ask him whether she is at home or not.
308207	eng	I assisted her in moving the furniture.
308208	eng	She began to sing, and we chimed in.
308209	eng	Can you hear her singing?
308210	eng	I heard her singing.
308211	eng	She is anything but a singer.
308212	eng	She laid hands on her own child.
308213	eng	She took part in our project.
308214	eng	It is not that she has rejected our offer.
308215	eng	He was in error in assuming that she would come to see him.
308216	eng	I am sorry that she is absent from the conference.
308217	eng	There is little hope of her recovery.
308218	eng	There is no stopping her going abroad.
308219	eng	She can't even speak her native language without making mistakes.
308220	eng	While she was out, the thief got away with her jewels.
308221	eng	I caught sight of her as she turned the corner.
308222	eng	It is true that she teaches French at school.
308223	eng	I think it's strange that she was absent from school.
308224	eng	She gave an address of welcome.
308225	eng	She was heard to criticize the manager.
308226	eng	It began to appear that she was wrong.
308227	eng	He will tell her about it when she comes back.
308228	eng	Should I wait for her to come back?
308229	eng	I will be gone by the time she comes back.
308230	eng	I feel sorry for her.
308231	eng	She fainted, and I had to hold her to keep her from falling.
308232	eng	I shouldn't wonder if she hasn't missed the train.
308233	eng	It is quite natural for her to get angry.
308234	eng	She was embarrassed by his sudden appearance.
308236	eng	Her tears perplexed him.
308237	eng	Tell me why she is crying.
308238	eng	He told me that she might well burst into tears.
308239	eng	I think you'd better lie low until she forgives you.
308240	eng	She was heard to cry.
308241	eng	We heard her cry.
308242	eng	It makes no difference to me whether she is rich or not.
308243	eng	She can't have said a thing like that to you.
308244	eng	It is quite natural for her to be angry with you.
308245	eng	She is very anxious about your health.
308246	eng	How should I answer if she inquires after you?
308249	eng	I was not aware of her absence.
308250	eng	I believe beyond doubt that she is innocent.
308251	eng	There is a rumor that she got married.
308252	eng	I heard from someone that she got married.
308253	eng	The news that she had married was a great shock to him.
308254	eng	She must have been over thirty when she got married.
308255	eng	What age was she when she got married?
308256	eng	I don't doubt that she is married.
308257	eng	I didn't know she was married.
308258	eng	The man whom she is going to marry is an astronaut.
308259	eng	The rumor that she's getting married is spreading around town.
308260	eng	The box she found was empty.
308261	eng	I feel grateful to hear that she has got well.
308262	eng	I don't know whether she will show up.
308263	eng	What she says may be true.
308264	eng	Can you make out what she is driving at?
308265	eng	What she said turned out to be false.
308266	eng	What she said wasn't true.
308269	eng	It took him a long time to take in what she was saying.
308270	eng	It took a long time to take in what she was saying.
308271	eng	I can't make out what she is saying.
308272	eng	When she called, I jumped up.
308273	eng	I just love her to death.
308274	eng	Her look says that she loves you.
308275	eng	It goes without saying that she is happy.
308276	eng	The war broke out when she was in Hiroshima.
308277	eng	It is no wonder that she didn't want to go.
308278	eng	It's not fair that she can go and I can't.
308279	eng	Since she's been gone, I want no one to talk to me.
308280	eng	I am very surprised that she became a Diet member.
308281	eng	The events that led up to her present fame are quite dramatic.
308282	eng	I wish she were alive now.
308284	eng	I will stay at home when she comes next.
308285	eng	I could tell at a glance that she was in trouble.
308286	eng	What she liked best was herring roe.
308287	eng	She was the last to cross the finishing line.
308288	eng	It is over ten years since she last went back to her country.
308289	eng	To my amazement she came first.
308290	eng	We must take into account the fact that she is old.
308291	eng	It doesn't matter whether she admits her guilt or not.
308292	eng	Her ability to amass a fortune is due to luck and hard work.
308293	eng	I tasted the cake she cooked.
308294	eng	What she told me yesterday is a white lie.
308295	eng	I wish she had come last night.
308296	eng	All she got for her pains was ingratitude.
308297	eng	Whether she will agree or not is not clear.
308298	eng	Whether she agrees or not is the question.
308299	eng	She is certain to turn up.
308300	eng	I have known her since she was a little girl.
308301	eng	Given her interest in children, I am sure teaching is the right career for her.
308303	eng	I often hear her refer to her childhood.
308304	eng	Everyone can tell she is thoughtful.
308305	eng	Who broke the news of her death to you?
308306	eng	The rumor of her death turned out false.
308307	eng	The news that she died is false.
308308	eng	She has been dead five years.
308309	eng	She has been dead for ten years.
308310	eng	Her deathly paleness is due to long illness.
308311	eng	French is taught us by her.
308312	eng	I never expected that she would join us.
308313	eng	I don't know if she wants to go with me.
308314	eng	She gave me this compact disc.
308315	eng	He asked me whether she had given me the book, or if I had bought it myself.
308316	eng	She taught me how to make a web site.
308317	eng	It is doubtful whether she will come to see me.
308318	eng	She came up to me and said "How are you?"
308319	eng	She sent me a postcard that said she hates the smell of animals.
308320	eng	I took it for granted that she would agree with me.
308321	eng	She smiled at me.
308322	eng	I couldn't think who she was when she spoke to me.
308323	eng	I'd rather she sat next to me.
308324	eng	She cannot have forgotten my address.
308325	eng	I reckoned on her to take my place.
308326	eng	I had her sweep my room.
308327	eng	She hindered me in my study.
308328	eng	I can't believe that she is older than my mother.
308329	eng	Had she been a friend of mine, I would have advised her not to do that.
308331	eng	I can't conceive of her deceiving me.
308332	eng	What a fool I am to think that she loves me!
308334	eng	She may be our teacher.
308335	eng	Her passing the exam is a sure thing.
308336	eng	I feel bad that she failed the examination.
308337	eng	There is little hope that she will come on time.
308338	eng	It is doubtful whether she will come on time.
308339	eng	Are you sure of her coming on time?
308340	eng	It is impossible that she should have killed herself.
308341	eng	Can it be true that she committed suicide?
308342	eng	We decided to let her alone until she stopped of her own accord.
308343	eng	It is necessary that she should go herself.
308344	eng	It's the way that she laughs at herself that endears her to me.
308345	eng	She can't have written it herself.
308346	eng	It is desirable that she should apologize to him herself.
308347	eng	The time will come when she will regret what she has said.
308348	eng	She may well be ashamed of her old clothes.
308349	eng	She may well take pride in her talent.
308350	eng	I have been to the place that she spoke about in her talk.
308351	eng	She is no match for me.
308352	eng	She held out her hand and I shook it.
308353	eng	Her letter saved me the trouble of visiting her house.
308354	eng	If only she were to help, the job would be finished sooner.
308355	eng	She stands a good chance of winning the prize.
308356	eng	As she is a lady, so he is a gentleman.
308357	eng	After making sure she was sound asleep, he crept out of the room and set off.
308358	eng	We had to get in touch with her before she went out.
308359	eng	She is exact in all the instructions she gives.
308360	eng	The party was animated by her presence.
308361	eng	We are delighted with her presence.
308362	eng	I went to the party on the presumption that she would be there.
308363	eng	Her first appearance on the stage was in 1969.
308364	eng	What she wrote is true in a sense.
308366	eng	You can always depend upon her to help.
308367	eng	She came to my aid.
308368	eng	She was heard to cry for help.
308369	eng	He was all the more angry because she wasn't in the least sorry.
308370	eng	To hear her laugh, you'd take her for a young girl.
308371	eng	Her smile indicates that she has forgiven me.
308372	eng	She is apt to win the prize.
308373	eng	As soon as she got on the train, it pulled out of the station.
308374	eng	She can only trust him.
308375	eng	She cannot have gone to bed yet.
308376	eng	All her imaginary happiness vanished in a moment.
308377	eng	Her anxiety was apparent to everyone.
308378	eng	She turned around and saw someone was following her.
308379	eng	He was relieved when she informed him that she had a rich new boyfriend.
308380	eng	There's a rumor abroad that she has got a new job.
308381	eng	She is a new addition to the teaching staff.
308382	eng	I like her all the more for her kindness.
308383	eng	Give her some flowers in return for her kindness.
308384	eng	When she comes of age, they are going to get married.
308385	eng	I am of the opinion that she is right.
308387	eng	It was through his influence that she became interested in ecology.
308388	eng	She is by no means honest.
308389	eng	It worried me that she looked pale.
308390	eng	She's going to be in charge.
308391	eng	Her constant complaints frustrated him deeply.
308392	eng	She had hardly entered the cabin when the light went out.
308393	eng	There is little possibility that she will be elected.
308394	eng	I noticed that she sat in the front row.
308397	eng	It was wise of her to leave home early.
308398	eng	I hope that she will get well soon.
308399	eng	If she had not advised her son, he would not have succeeded.
308400	eng	She may well be proud of her son.
308405	eng	We suggested that she should make up for the loss.
308406	eng	We demanded that she should make up for the loss.
308407	eng	I admit her superiority to others.
308408	eng	I've never heard her speak ill of others.
308410	eng	We must allow for her poor health.
308411	eng	Please explain the reason why she was arrested.
308412	eng	I heard her calling from the kitchen.
308413	eng	She came into the dining room to find it empty.
308414	eng	Didn't you notice that she was very excited?
308415	eng	Who she is I have no idea.
308416	eng	I like her all the better for her shyness.
308417	eng	We changed our plans because of her late arrival.
308418	eng	When she was late, I felt like scolding her, but I held my tongue.
308419	eng	She rarely, if ever, goes out of town.
308420	eng	I saw her coming across the street.
308421	eng	I stepped aside for her to pass by.
308422	eng	He stepped aside for her to pass.
308423	eng	She drove a car down a country road.
308424	eng	Might she have missed her train?
308425	eng	It happened that I was present when she called.
308426	eng	The tub ran over while she was on the phone.
308427	eng	It makes no difference to me whether she lives in the city or in the country.
308428	eng	Please tell me the reason why she got angry.
308430	eng	She may well get angry.
308433	eng	To her embarrassment, her baby never stopped crying.
308435	eng	I'll let you know when she arrives.
308436	eng	She may well be proud of her smart son.
308437	eng	There is no need for her to work.
308438	eng	I'm glad to hear that she is unmarried.
308439	eng	Her sudden appearance in the doorway surprised us.
308440	eng	The news of her sudden death came like a bolt from the blue.
308441	eng	Her sudden arrival prevented him from going out.
308443	eng	It will serve you right if she never speaks to you again.
308444	eng	It was true that she had got married twice.
308445	eng	When she came inside, we had finished eating dinner.
308446	eng	She has been hospitalized for 2 months already.
308447	eng	She has been in hospital for a month.
308448	eng	I can't see her ruin her whole life.
308449	eng	What she bought was very expensive.
308450	eng	He arrived the day she left.
308451	eng	She had her hair cut because she liked shorter hair, not because she had lost her love.
308452	eng	She gave me a humorous account of her encounter with him.
308453	eng	We were disappointed to hear that she had married him.
308454	eng	She has been married to him for a decade now.
308455	eng	No wonder she didn't show up to see him off. They broke up.
308456	eng	She is his present wife.
308457	eng	She cannot have turned down his offer.
308458	eng	I think it natural for her to decline his offer.
308459	eng	Her mention of his name rang a bell.
308460	eng	She may well speak ill of him.
308461	eng	I couldn't understand why she frowned at him.
308463	eng	The lot fell to her to help him.
308464	eng	It is quite natural that she should get angry with him.
308465	eng	Seeing that she is tired, we had better stop for a while.
308466	eng	That she was tired was plain to see.
308467	eng	There is no denying that she is very efficient.
308468	eng	It is not because she is beautiful that I like her.
308469	eng	He exclaimed that she was beautiful.
308470	eng	We are alone in believing that she is a beautiful woman.
308471	eng	She accompanied me to the hospital.
308472	eng	That she is ill is obvious.
308473	eng	The fact that she is ill worries me a lot.
308474	eng	It's too bad she's ill.
308476	eng	I'm afraid we can't rule out the possibility that she may have the disease.
308477	eng	She cannot have been ill.
308478	eng	It never occurred to me that she was ill in hospital.
308480	eng	She has been sick for a week.
308481	eng	She has been ill for three weeks.
308483	eng	Just because she is poor, it does not follow that she is dishonest.
308484	eng	There's no disguising the fact that she is dishonest.
308485	eng	It'll be a long time before she gets over her father's death.
308486	eng	Well may she admire her father.
308487	eng	I saw her leaving the room.
308488	eng	I could hear her sobbing in her bedroom.
308489	eng	There was a murmur when she entered the room.
308491	eng	When she returned to her room, the diamond ring was gone.
308492	eng	She came into the room.
308493	eng	As soon as she entered the room, I rose to my feet and made a deep bow.
308494	eng	As she entered the room, he sat up in his bed.
308495	eng	When she entered the room, he got to his feet.
308496	eng	Why was it that she got angry?
308497	eng	It never occurred to him that she would get angry.
308498	eng	I was surprised at her inability to do things promptly.
308499	eng	She painted the picture which is on the wall.
308500	eng	The doctor she visited is famous.
308501	eng	She gave me a present.
308503	eng	She got me by the hand.
308504	eng	I was anxious that she accept my offer.
308505	eng	I discovered that she was better at math than I.
308506	eng	She drives me mad.
308507	eng	I was very glad that she took my side.
308508	eng	They made fun of her because she had a funny hat on.
308509	eng	I know she is sleeping.
308510	eng	May she return home safely.
308511	eng	Make certain that she returned home safely.
308512	eng	She may well be proud of her daughter.
308513	eng	I can't ensure that she will be here tomorrow.
308514	eng	She was seen to run up the stairs with tears in her eyes.
308515	eng	I will have her call you as soon as she comes back.
308516	eng	I'll have her call you when she gets back.
308517	eng	I'll leave when she comes back.
308518	eng	Let's wait here until she comes back.
308519	eng	I saw her taking a walk in the park at midnight.
308520	eng	I am angry that she didn't keep her promise.
308521	eng	She cannot have broken her promise.
308522	eng	He predicted she would win.
308523	eng	The coat she wanted was eye-poppingly expensive.
308524	eng	When she turned up, the party was over.
308525	eng	Give her this letter when she comes.
308526	eng	As soon as she comes, we will begin.
308527	eng	He was going to leave the house when she came.
308528	eng	I had almost finished my work when she came.
308529	eng	I don't know the reason why she isn't coming.
308530	eng	Her absence robbed us of our pleasure.
308531	eng	Much to my disappointment, she did not come.
308532	eng	I little imagined that she would come.
308533	eng	What a pity she can't come!
308534	eng	Do you know the reason which prevented her from coming?
308535	eng	It is doubtful whether she will come.
308536	eng	I don't know if she will come.
308537	eng	I don't know whether she will come.
308538	eng	I have no information she is coming.
308539	eng	I heard her come here.
308540	eng	I will go provided that she comes.
308541	eng	I will wait until she comes.
308542	eng	She didn't need to come.
308543	eng	There is much talk that she is going to France next month.
308544	eng	It is true that she'll get married next month.
308545	eng	I had to grab her to keep her from falling.
308546	eng	The news that she got divorced was a big surprise.
308547	eng	While she was out the thief got away with her jewels.
308548	eng	I remember that she wore a green hat.
308549	eng	She is first in line.
308550	eng	The boy who she brought with her was very handsome.
308551	eng	He interrupted her while she was speaking.
308552	eng	The man whom she is talking with is Mr Allen.
308553	eng	The more she talked, the more bored I got.
308554	eng	The man with whom she is talking is Mr Allen.
308555	eng	She used all her skills making this dish.
308556	eng	She is old enough to know better than to expect too much of her parents.
308557	eng	Can a child of her age distinguish good from bad?
308558	eng	She just blew it off.
308559	eng	She soon adjusted herself to the new school.
308560	eng	She's smartly dressed.
308561	eng	She saw red at that moment.
308562	eng	Not only she, but her sons have been satisfied.
308563	eng	Not only she but also you are wrong.
308564	eng	Not only she but also her parents were invited to the party.
308565	eng	The girls are making merry in the yard.
308566	eng	Her speech was excellent.
308567	eng	They envy you your beauty.
308568	eng	They have left school now.
308569	eng	Do you remember what she was like?
308570	eng	They sang in chorus.
308571	eng	Women have grown tired of being looked down on by employers.
308572	eng	We didn't stay home yesterday.
308573	eng	She gave us lots to eat.
308575	eng	The women led the movement to obtain female suffrage.
308576	eng	They loved Nagasaki so much that they stayed there for a week.
308577	eng	She tries so hard, but she's just spinning her wheels.
308578	eng	She doesn't have a lazy bone in her body.
308579	eng	I'm getting married to her in June.
308580	eng	She opened the door.
308581	eng	I wish I could have gone with her.
308582	eng	It's a marvelous thing to do a play with her.
308584	eng	I am looking forward to seeing the film with her.
308585	eng	I generally agree with her.
308586	eng	She's as good as pie.
308587	eng	Do you ever date her?
308588	eng	I enjoyed talking with her.
308589	eng	I began a meeting with her.
308590	eng	She and I usually agree.
308591	eng	I meet her on occasion at a beauty shop.
308592	eng	What relation is she to you?
308593	eng	Do you see her often?
308594	eng	I haven't met her.
308595	eng	I hit it off well with her.
308596	eng	I hit it off badly with her.
308598	eng	I have not been on speaking terms with her for a few years.
308599	eng	She is more an acquaintance than a friend.
308600	eng	I feel comfortable in her company.
308601	eng	I don't feel at home in her company.
308602	eng	She is amusing to be with.
308603	eng	I feel ill at ease in her company.
308604	eng	You will never get bored in her company.
308605	eng	I am sorry that I could not go with her.
308606	eng	Will you meet her?
308607	eng	It is no use arguing with her.
308609	eng	I bump into her.
308612	eng	Whoever wants to marry her must first convince her father.
308613	eng	I had known her for ten years when I married her.
308615	eng	Tell me the reason why you married her.
308616	eng	I wish I had got married to her.
308617	eng	I will be able to marry her.
308618	eng	I couldn't make her out at all.
308619	eng	I have nothing in common with her.
308620	eng	She and I are in the same class.
308621	eng	It happened that she and I liked the same kind of music.
308622	eng	She and I get on well.
308623	eng	I exchanged seats with her.
308624	eng	I struck up an acquaintance with her.
308625	eng	It was pure accident that I came to know her.
308626	eng	How long have you known her?
308627	eng	I am friendly with her.
308628	eng	I made up with her.
308629	eng	I tried to keep in with her in vain.
308630	eng	I met up with her on the street.
308631	eng	I speak French as well as she does.
308632	eng	Can you distinguish her from her sister?
308633	eng	I got together with her mainly because we seemed to share the same feelings about things.
308634	eng	I can't stand losing her.
308635	eng	You should watch your language when you talk to her.
308636	eng	I am fed up with talking to her.
308637	eng	She is a student from Canada, staying with my uncle.
308638	eng	She will cope with all the work.
308639	eng	She deserves to succeed.
308640	eng	She married to the kind of man you would expect her to pick.
308641	eng	I have an acquaintance with her.
308642	eng	I owe ten dollars to her.
308643	eng	Shall I send a few books for her?
308644	eng	I am sure I saw her two years ago.
308645	eng	I have seen her three times.
308646	eng	My heart beats fast each time I see her.
308647	eng	I saw her only a week ago.
308648	eng	I remember telling her that news.
308649	eng	She seems to have found a boyfriend.
308653	eng	I tried to give her some money, but she wouldn't take any.
308654	eng	She shall serve tea.
308656	eng	To kiss her is one thing, and to love is another.
308657	eng	I motioned to her not to smoke.
308658	eng	It is true that I was head over heels in love with her.
308659	eng	Please give my best thanks to her.
308660	eng	Give her these roses, and she will be pleased.
308661	eng	I would like to thank you in advance for any help that you are able to give her.
308662	eng	I don't want to be the one who breaks the news to her.
308663	eng	Shall I ask her to send the book to us?
308664	eng	It is impossible to make her understand the theory.
308665	eng	I don't feel like telling her about it.
308666	eng	You shouldn't have told her such a thing.
308667	eng	It's rude of you to ask her that question.
308669	eng	She fooled me into giving her the money.
308670	eng	All sorts of rumors rose about her past.
308671	eng	I know nothing about her except that she is a pianist.
308672	eng	I know nothing about her.
308673	eng	Where did you see her?
308674	eng	To her joy, all the guest praised the meal.
308675	eng	Nothing is more precious to her than the brooch.
308676	eng	She values health above wealth.
308677	eng	Singing comes as naturally to her as flying does to birds.
308678	eng	It seems to be difficult for her to get along with students in the new school.
308679	eng	Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to watch her son growing up.
308680	eng	It makes no difference to her whether she lives in a city or in the country.
308681	eng	Ask her how much soup she wants.
308682	eng	She froze me in her stare.
308683	eng	She could not make both ends meet on her income.
308684	eng	We all thought she was devoid of sense.
308685	eng	She has two brothers, who work in the computer industry.
308686	eng	She has two sisters, who live in Kyoto.
308687	eng	She has three sons, who became sailors.
308688	eng	She has no fewer than seven sons.
308689	eng	She appears to have few friends.
308690	eng	I like her all the better for her naughtiness.
308691	eng	Her mother always accompanies her.
308692	eng	She has some faults, but I love her none the less.
308693	eng	I'm fed up with her.
308694	eng	She has two uncles; one lives in Kyoto and the other in Osaka.
308695	eng	She is proof against flattery.
308696	eng	I think she has a fair amount of sense.
308697	eng	She is said to have had a nice husband.
308698	eng	She has great charm.
308699	eng	She had, I thought, no reason to do what she did.
308700	eng	She is equal to the occasion.
308701	eng	She found the evening boring and uninteresting, in short, a waste of time.
308702	eng	The story came home to her.
308703	eng	She appears to have many friends.
