Fari yelled at the top of his lungs. "My... PMSing as usual, I see," the King continued to mutter dejectedly. "Shit, I'm so fucking bored. Nothing good on TV. Nothing good online. Nothing good to eat." As he was about to leave the dining hall, his eyes were drawn to a cinnamon jar standing lonely on the table. A spoon of cinnamon was placed conveniently next to it. In a saner state the King may have been reasonably suspicious about it, but now he was so exhausted from boredom that any opportunity to relieve it for a minute felt like a blessing. "I wonder what ground cinnamon tastes like," said he nonchalantly and put the spoon in his mouth.

The King went on running around the room frantically, looking desperately for water. Luckily, Duke Onkled happened to be pouring himself a glass of water. "Your Omnipotence, have water," he offered dutifully. "Gimme!" demanded the King, who then emptied the glass in a split second. "Damn, that was awful."

3955423	eng	Pluto is tilted 122.5 degrees on its axis, which basically means that it is rotating on its head!
3955424	eng	The Sun is the biggest object in our solar system. It contains more than 99% of the solar system's mass.
3955425	eng	Astronomers think that the solar system is more than 4 billion years old.
3955426	eng	Pluto, which was once called a planet, is now called a dwarf planet.
3955427	eng	The words " solar system" refer to the Sun and all of the objects that travel around it. These objects include planets, natural satellites such as the Moon, the asteroid belt, comets, and meteoroids.
3955428	eng	Our solar system has an elliptical shape and is part of a galaxy known as the Milky Way.
3955429	eng	The Sun contains 99.8% of all of the mass in our solar system.
3955430	eng	Some astronomers believe the whole solar system formed from a single flat cloud of gas, while others believe it formed when a huge object passed near the Sun, pulling a stream of gas off of the Sun. Astronomers theorize the planets then formed from this gas stream.
3955431	eng	A planet is a large space body which reflects the light of a star around which it revolves.
3955432	eng	The planets in our solar system are classified as inner planets and outer planets.
3955433	eng	The inner planets, the closest to the Sun, are solid spheres of rock and include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
3955434	eng	The outer planets are large gaseous spheres with rings and include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
3955435	eng	Between the inner and outer planets is an asteroid belt.
3955436	eng	Every planet, except for Earth, was named for an ancient Roman god or goddess.
3955437	eng	The temperature on Mercury gets so hot it could melt a tin pan.
3955438	eng	After much debate, it was decided that to be a planet in our solar system, an object must be in orbit around the Sun, have enough mass so that it has become round in shape due to its own gravity, and have cleared out its orbital path around the Sun.
3955439	eng	Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system.
3955440	eng	Mercury travels around the Sun faster than any other planet. That is how it got its name. It was named after Mercury, the swift messenger of the gods in ancient Roman mythology.
3955441	eng	Mercury can only be seen from Earth just before sunrise or just after sunset, but not in the middle of the night. That is because Mercury always appears near the Sun when viewed from Earth.
3955442	eng	Mercury has a very thin atmosphere.
3955443	eng	Mercury is only about one-third the size of the Earth. It is smaller than any other planet.
3955444	eng	Mercury is very close to the Sun and has no substantial atmosphere.
3955445	eng	Mercury has the greatest temperature range of any planet or natural satellite in our solar system.
3955446	eng	The surface temperature on the side of Mercury closest to the Sun reaches 427 degrees Celsius, a temperature hot enough to melt tin. On the side facing away from the Sun, or the night side, the temperature drops to -183 degrees Celsius.
3955447	eng	Scientists have detected a magnetic field surrounding Mercury, though it is not as strong as the field around the Earth.
3955448	eng	Mercury's atmosphere is very thin and is composed of helium and sodium.
3955449	eng	The surface of Mercury has been shaped by three processes: impact cratering where large objects struck the surface resulting in crater formation, volcanism where lava flooded the surface, and tectonic activity where the planet's crust moved in order to adjust to the planetary cooling and contracting.
3955450	eng	Venus is called the Evening Star. It is called this because it looks so bright to us from Earth.
3955451	eng	Venus and Earth are almost the same size.
3955452	eng	Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
3955453	eng	Venus gets so hot during the day that it could melt a lead cannonball. The temperature rises to 484 degrees Celsius on the side facing the Sun.
3955454	eng	Venus has very thick, rapidly spinning clouds which cover its surface.
3955455	eng	Venus is unusual because it rotates in a direction opposite that of all of the other planets.
3955456	eng	The thick clouds which cover Venus cause a "greenhouse effect". The clouds prevent heat from leaving the atmosphere.
3955457	eng	Venus is referred to as the Evening Star because it is the brightest planet that can be viewed from Earth. Its thick cloud cover is an excellent reflector of the Sun's light.

3955501	eng	Due to the friction generated between a meteor and the atmospheric gases, most meteors burn up before hitting Earth's surface as a meteorite.
3955502	eng	The Earth rotates on an imaginary axis which is tilted at a 23.5 degree angle.
3955503	eng	Earth has a core of molten iron-nickel.
3955504	eng	The rapid spin of the Earth along with the liquid, hot metallic core causes a magnetic field to surround the Earth.
3955505	eng	The Earth's magnetic field traps the charged particles which are hurled at the Earth by the Sun during solar wind activity. When these charged particles react with the gases in our atmosphere, the gases begin to glow. These aurorae, or glowing gases, are seen in the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle.
3955506	eng	Earth has one naturally occurring satellite, the Moon.
3955507	eng	The rapid spin of the Earth along with the molten metallic core produces the Earth's magnetic field.
3955508	eng	If the Earth was any closer to the Sun, it would be too hot to support life. If the Earth was any farther away from the Sun, it would be too cold to support life.

3955516	eng	Mars is covered by a dirt which has a lot of iron. The iron makes the planet look red.
3955517	eng	The orbit of Mars around the Sun is extremely elliptical.
3955518	eng	Because the distance between the Sun and Mars varies, temperatures range from -125 degrees Celsius in the Martian winter to 22 degrees Celsius in the Martian summer.
3955519	eng	The Martian atmosphere is composed of over 95% carbon dioxide. Solar winds carry the thin, weak atmosphere away because Mars has a weak gravitational and magnetic field.

3955692	eng	In July of 1994, Jupiter was hit by pieces of the Shoemaker-Levy comet. Dark areas appeared in Jupiter's atmosphere after the large pieces hit the planet.
3955693	eng	Astronomers think the Great Red Spot is a large hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's atmosphere.
3955694	eng	Jupiter's rapid rotation causes the planet to flatten at the poles and bulge at the equator.
3955695	eng	Jupiter emits twice as much heat as it absorbs from the Sun, which indicates it has its own internal heat source.
3955696	eng	Astronomers estimate Jupiter's core temperature at 20,000 degrees Celsius, approximately three times greater than the temperature of the Earth's core.
3955697	eng	Jupiter's powerful magnetic field is thought to be generated by the electric currents produced by pressurized hydrogen in the mantle.
3955698	eng	Jupiter's atmosphere is thought to be composed of hydrogen, helium, sulfur, and nitrogen. Clouds in the atmosphere move in alternating bands from east to west or west to east.
3955699	eng	Voyager 2 has confirmed that Jupiter is surrounded by a system of thin rings.
3955700	hun	Hosszú az út.
3955701	eng	For over three hundred years, the Great Red Spot has been observed on Jupiter.
3955702	eng	Astronomers believe the Great Red Spot is caused by a potent hurricane-like storm system in Jupiter's atmosphere.
3955703	eng	When seen through a telescope, Saturn is one of the most beautiful sights in the night sky.
3955704	eng	Saturn is a very large gas planet which spins very rapidly on its axis.
3955705	eng	Saturn's atmosphere has winds which can blow at over 1800 kilometers per hour.
3955706	eng	The white spots on Saturn are believed to be powerful storms.
3955707	eng	Saturn is surrounded by over 1000 rings made of ice and dust. Some of the rings are very thin and some are very thick. The size of the particles in the rings range from pebble-size to house-size.
3955708	eng	Scientists believe that the particles in Saturn's rings came from the destruction of moons circling the planet. As comets and meteorites smashed the moons, Saturn's gravitational pull shaped the particles into rings.
3955709	eng	Saturn has at least 53 moons. Some of these moons orbit the planet within the rings, creating gaps in the rings.
3955710	eng	The rings around Saturn are made up of dust and ice.
3955711	eng	Saturn has the lowest density of any planet in our solar system. Its density is so low that it would float if it was placed in water.
3955712	eng	Just like Jupiter, Saturn emits twice as much heat as it absorbs from the Sun indicating it also has an internal heat source.
3955713	eng	Saturn has an extensive ring system which is formed by a thousand individual rings.
3955714	eng	The thickness of Saturn's rings ranges from 10 to 100 meters and the rings vary in brightness.
3955715	eng	Astronomers believe Saturn's rings developed from particles that resulted from the break-up of naturally occurring satellites.
3955716	eng	The particles in the rings closer to the planet orbit the planet at a faster speed than the particles in the rings farther from the planet.
3955717	eng	Uranus is one of the smaller gas giants in our solar system, but it is still large enough to hold 64 planets the size of Earth.
3955718	eng	When William Herschel discovered Uranus, he at first thought he had discovered a comet.
3955719	eng	Cold methane gas is responsible for the blue-green color of Uranus.
3955720	eng	Uranus tilts over so far on its axis that it rotates on its side. Because of this, its poles are sometimes pointed almost directly at the Sun.
3955721	eng	Uranus' atmosphere is made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
3955722	eng	The rapid rotation of Uranus causes winds up to 600 kilometers per hour to blow in its atmosphere.
3955723	eng	Uranus has eleven known rings which contain dark, boulder-sized particles.
3955724	eng	Uranus has 27 named moons. Some of these moons are less than 100 kilometers wide and black as coal.
3955725	eng	Uranus is a large, plain, blue-green planet which can only be seen from the Earth with the unaided eye on a clear, dark night.
3955726	eng	Uranus is unique in our solar system because it is tilted 98 degrees. When viewed from Earth, it appears to rotate on its side!
