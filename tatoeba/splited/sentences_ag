327143	eng	If so then I want you to do something for me. That will make us even.
327144	eng	You get drunk on just one centimeter? And Kensuke was such a heavy drinker.
327145	eng	You see in this world there are only scoundrels and hypocrites.
327147	eng	"Mister"ing a tick? You're a funny kid.
327148	eng	Isn't it better to get drunk and cut loose once in a while and blow off the tension of daily frustration?
327149	eng	Why not just let fly once in a while?
327150	eng	It is a consolation that no one was killed.
327151	eng	The taxi collided head-on with a dumpster truck and was badly crushed.
327152	eng	Incidentally a motorway ramp is being constructed in the neighbourhood, a few hundred metres away, of my clinic.
327153	eng	Incidentally this room doesn't have anything like an air-conditioner. All it has is a fan.
327154	eng	By the way, this week - no matter what flags are set - it's a certainty that there will be no ecchi scenes. You'll just have to bear with it a while.
327155	eng	By the way, it also works with the wheel of a wheel mouse.
327156	eng	By the way, my English is absolutely hopeless.
327157	eng	I searched at the pub for the person I had met online, but there was nobody who looked like that.

327168	eng	Sheesh, that Keiko - she's cute or she's hateful, just can't make her out.
327169	eng	Or rather it seems, Kensuke arrived at the studio at the same that I and the other two were still coming.
327170	eng	Or rather, is it not just pathetic that I think such whiny thoughts like this?
327171	eng	Thoughts of being trapped grew stronger.

327177	eng	I also digitized it and made a desktop image.
327178	eng	If you can, get a sketchbook and a 4B pencil. You don't need such expensive art materials yet.
327179	eng	I tried to make it as cheap as possible.
327180	eng	If at all possible, you should go and look into the matter yourself.
327181	eng	The design was also given the finishing touch to have launch impact and dynamism provided by the novelty of the arch shaped logo design.
327182	eng	Let's have a party with members of the tennis club.
327183	eng	However, Vince, on Jen's house's veranda, was naked from the waist up. He might even have been starkers!
327184	eng	There's no but about it!
327185	eng	But on the day of the mock exams, there are no club activities, so that means I can walk back home with Haruka. And I'm grateful for that.
327186	eng	Theremin: The world's first electronic musical instrument, made by Russian physicist Lev Sergeivitch Termen in 1920.

327189	eng	What sort of current affairs appear in the civil service examination?
327190	eng	I don't know what, but I felt in my heart something that gives me the chills.
327191	eng	No doubt, regardless of the time, she was planning to go to the net café without me if I hadn't arrived first.
327192	eng	I'm sure Taeko was scared and tried to get Yuri to go along with her.

327195	eng	It looks like we've been able to fill in that one year gap and renew our old friendship.
327196	eng	It seems like that she wasn't acting back then; they were her real feelings.
327197	eng	It looks like I must have dozed off.
327198	eng	So? Feeling refreshed, the morning after graduating from virginity?
327199	eng	What happened to this place?! It's completely dead!
327200	eng	No matter how you look at it you're a beautiful, ill-fated woman, the heroine of a tragedy.
327201	eng	By the way, I wonder how much of a hand Hiragawa MP plays in this matter?

327203	eng	Got cancelled at the last minute. 'Deferred to next week'.
327204	eng	It isn't clear which of them wanted that.
327205	eng	No, no! That's not right.
327206	eng	It's a very good company! The president is a real go-getter and the workers all put in their best.
327207	eng	Anyhow, lunch ... is where I wanted to go but I decided to go to the toilet first.
327208	eng	Tom went splashing through the shallows.
327209	eng	Thanks, I hear you've been taking care of my little brat of a brother.
327210	eng	Please simmer the beans for a while over a low heat.
327211	eng	Whatever you need to talk about, if I will do, I'll answer with loving care.
327212	eng	Whatever the reason, forfeiting the trade that we finally got on track is a fiasco.
327213	eng	Did I say something funny? Did I make a joke?
327214	eng	For some reason economic booms have names taken from Japanese mythology given to them.
327215	eng	For some reason it didn't go well, shot down at every attempt, and he led a sad "History of no girlfriend = Age" life.
327216	eng	I wonder why it is that some plants become annuals and others perennials?
327217	eng	This is not to say that Mr. Tanaka did it all on his own.
327218	eng	I had tried to avoid thinking that as much as possible but as soon as I faced it I started to feel miserable.
327219	eng	I had a nagging feeling that the atmosphere resembled somebody and, now that you mention it, yes, you're right. Certainly ZZ TOP had this kind of feel.
327220	eng	You've run into some trouble or something?
327221	eng	I don't quite follow, but it looks like it will prove tricky. Ergh.
327222	eng	Why don't you leg it?
327223	eng	I wonder why he was suddenly dropped from the team half way through?
327224	eng	Somehow you must find a way to finish this work in one month.

327297	eng	Really - what's up? Where's your go-for-it attitude?

327305	eng	Good grief! I had no idea you had been placed in such a tight spot.
327306	eng	Don't tell me it was really a demand for money from debt collectors?
327307	eng	That you should be stalking Hanako! You'd been quiet recently so I'd let my guard down.
327308	eng	You haven't fallen in love have you!? I won't have it! Having that man become my brother-in-law; I absolutely hate that!
327309	eng	First, we will present a petition to the mayor and collect signatures.
327310	eng	First off, my area of work is mainly in the lower reaches of the Yourou River.
327311	eng	Starting off, first on the agenda is about this morning's two-in-a-bed ruckus.
327312	eng	It's not yet what you'd call finished but we're starting to get pretty good results.
327313	eng	Also as they are in an intimate relationship they are in a situation where it is easy for them to suffer from violence and difficult for them to bring complaints about that to court.
327315	eng	I haven't decided either way. I want to keep an eye on how things go.
327316	eng	It's still minor league but in the not so distant future they'll be coming to a place near you.
327317	eng	It is very important to be careful not to forget them when you leave.

327320	eng	Mitsuna is very tidy so she often cleans up without being asked.
327321	eng	Everybody has their own projects on, so after all you are the only suitable candidate.

327330	eng	Enough! I can't get any study done at all!
327331	eng	Could you repeat that?
327332	eng	Hmph, Yayoi's navigation was difficult to follow so we ended up going round and round the same places.
327333	eng	There's a comparatively large cinema complex inside the mall.

327335	eng	If I drop out of contact, let the police know, OK?
327336	eng	Of course he thought it was a joke and let it slide with a "hm?" but he was seriously annoyed. I mean, just don't say things like that even as a joke!
327337	eng	With most things there's both what you see and what's behind it.
327338	eng	I finally got hold of that book I wanted.

328151	eng	"Ah, this is my idiot son Takashi" "Eh-er, yes. (The late) Takashi, right?" "Fuusy, he isn't dead yet! Probably."
328152	eng	This, appearing at first glance to be perfectly obvious, is actually very difficult.
328153	eng	Not wanting to boast but I've never got better than a 3 on my report card for home economics. Out of 10 that is.

328162	eng	That's not what I meant. I'm not being sexist. Men and women are just different.
328163	eng	The other day when I stopped by at a friend's house, it wasn't my friend that came out of the front door, but her husband.
328164	eng	It was your cousin. Second year, current member of student council, club activity is basketball, working as vice captain.
328165	eng	I've set the stage so now you just have to show some guts, OK?
328166	eng	"That's dangerous, I'll clear it up." "It's OK ... Ouch!" "Look, didn't I tell you so?"
328167	eng	If you're with me as a staff officer then I need you to bring a sense of danger with you to your work.

328171	eng	The website's tagline has to let people know what that business does and how it differs from the competition.

328173	eng	"Is that some sort of uniform?" "Oh right, it's because I play field hockey."
328174	eng	As the lesson comes to an end, even if the teacher doesn't say a word of "be quiet", "sit down!," the children naturally return to their seats and quieten down.

328180	eng	"By the way, do you know what a Shinto shrine is?" "I've a little bit of knowledge on the subject. It's a religious facility where that which is the object of worship, that called the genius loci, is enshrined."
328184	eng	Yes. I'm pretty sure there are complimentary tickets that haven't been used somewhere.
328185	eng	Not to be taken lightly, local amusement parks. Couples, families, as far as can be seen people, people, people.
328186	eng	A creepy cry that sounds like a human voice, velvet black wings, the image of tearing into dead flesh; crows are known across the world as an ill-omened bird that flies down with ill-luck.
328187	eng	Hey, Cleo. Don't wander around too much, OK? We've only just entered the park.
328188	eng	Despite having lazed around without having touched my work I'm frightened at heart that "Ooh-er, this time I might really not get done in time!?"
328189	eng	Light source, that is what direction the light is facing, also take care with shadowing. Just copy down into the sketch book you have at hand as accurately as possible.
328190	eng	There were figures there from those of an age best called girls and boys to those who looked to be old enough to be about to live out their life span.
328191	eng	To keep holding the barrier up is just to wait for death! So we're going to go out past the wall and counter attack the enemy, you ready!?
328192	eng	The girl, her eyes shining brightly from that single hint, makes her cute cat-motif automatic pencil run across her notebook.
328193	eng	A certain movie was novelized - rather it was a scenario written for a movie that was expanded as a novel and localized to Japanese.
328194	eng	About the same time as he entered the classroom and arrived at his seat, the chime to announce class rings across the school.
328195	eng	That's because they're the classic places for 'something' to appear. Like the grand piano that plays by itself, the human anatomical model that moves by itself ...

328198	eng	"I might like to know about your relations with men." "Relations with men?" "Things like who you get on well with, who you've dated and such."
328199	eng	There were long desks lined up, several pipe chairs, and stuck on the bulletin board were a calendar and several printouts.
328200	eng	"Did I really sigh?" "While giving out an aura of unhappiness."
328201	eng	Shall we go with cornflakes or something light from tomorrow?
328202	eng	It's only manners to tackle all out a game that they have gone all out in creating. Pressing the pause button is just rude!
328203	eng	I had imagined that the newbies fresh from university would probably be stuck with all the backstage work - collecting reference material, getting copies and such but I couldn't have been proved more wrong.
328204	eng	It's obvious but the connection between people is "words". It is by those words that thoughts are shared and arguments carried out.
328205	eng	It's just if we have it every day we're bound to get fed up with it. I must increase the variety of my cooking.
328206	eng	"Well, it's hot again today, isn't it?" "That's one more time you've started with a bland topic."
328207	eng	The other day, a water quality inspection was carried out at our house. We had it done by a certain famous company's Environment Analysis Center or some such name.
328208	eng	Then what is this I wonder? If it isn't dodgy door-to-door sales then could it be a new kind of pickup technique for the ladies?
328209	eng	It was to say that going to the station was too much of a bother after all so I should come to the hotel she's staying at. Good grief, what a selfish woman!
328210	eng	"Ah ... I'm just not feeling so well" "Really? Are you OK?" "Heh-heh. Actually I'm playing hooky."
328211	eng	The exchange unfolding in front of my eyes had not a single millimetre of a gap in which for me to slip.
328212	eng	There is a matter that we would like to discuss urgently regarding club activities, so please come to the staff room.
328213	eng	In addition to the general curriculum there are tutorials in the essentials of machinery, training is also carried out for skills in and learning how to use the various types of machinery.
328214	eng	I have to wrap my sister's dinner in clingfilm.
328215	eng	What on earth spurred them to such an action?
328216	eng	I think that as long as I don't overeat, I will certainly lose weight.
328217	eng	If you skip breakfast and keep lunch light, then in the evening you can have whatever you want.
328218	eng	A gift of cheesecake is apparently good to soothe discord.
328219	eng	We are now going to move to the crematorium so if Mr. Ogawa and you would enter the car ...
328220	eng	Ha-ha, you always stretch when class is over don't you?
328222	eng	Truthfully, if I'd said I didn't have any regrets over my snap decision I'd have been lying.
328223	eng	It's said to be a girls' high school characterised by its quiet and traditional feel and a chic, high-class uniform.
328224	eng	The days after that flew past.
328225	eng	The first thing that came to my attention was the large sofa. It was covered in sober coloured leather, the seat and the back both looked wide and comfortable.
328226	eng	There isn't anybody in front of the main gate yet.
328227	eng	I am still clumsy catching batons thrown high up.
328228	eng	With a pitter-patter of footsteps she runs off to the entrance.
328229	eng	Microfibre cloth is cloth woven from fibres as narrow as a hundredth of the width of a hair.
328230	eng	It was I who found her. She'd lost consciousness so I carried her to the infirmary.
328231	eng	She has a boyfriend she's been going out with since high school but feels their relationship has become a matter of habit and is increasingly dissatisfied.
328232	eng	Get a move on!
328233	eng	Let's have a contest. The side to come up with the worst insult wins.
328234	eng	Dammit, that pest Nagisa, she really went and snitched on me to the teachers.
328235	eng	・ Corrected mistaken/missing characters in the text data.
328236	eng	"Ryu, I can't seeee!" "Naturally, that's because I'm covering your eyes."
328237	eng	"Isn't it about time you tried photographing people or something?" "Eh? Snapshots? I don't know ..."
328238	eng	With that sort of attitude you'll never get past the honourable-mention prizes.
328239	eng	First thing today there's an appointment for a portrait ... what do you say? Will you try doing it as a test?
328240	eng	I quietly take out my camera, so as not to be noticed by my photographic subject, and peek through the finder.
328241	eng	There's no way one that big is going to go on a bike's luggage rest.
328242	eng	Please do your model building at home! The room's full of the smell of lacquer.
328243	eng	As we entered the shopping district Haruna's gaze darted about, just like she was a rustic from the hills, as she looked over the area.
328244	eng	The servants gathered there totalled ... n-nearly one hundred!
328245	eng	"You mustn't be late, OK?" "But if the teacher's late too it doesn't count, right?"
328246	eng	What? You can't do it? You coward! Chicken!
328247	eng	Come on, get walking!
328248	eng	OK, here's the donation ... 10 yen each. Here you go, Mihane.
328249	eng	Last week I was treated to dinner by my friend who'd won at pachinko. It was all-you-can-eat so I ate to my heart's content.
328250	eng	"What is this? An offering?" "That's right. Put it in this offertory box ... and pull this rope."
328251	eng	Well then I'll allow two on a bike, but you peddle. Because I'll be sitting on the luggage platform.
328252	eng	"What're you doing?" "The household books. Our finances are pretty tight so we have to do things properly."
328253	eng	To apply further analysis to documents and files matching the keywords and find the hidden truth is "knowledge".
328254	eng	This autumn I am, unusually, watching many drama series.
328255	eng	"Buy a lottery ticket or something?" "Well, I don't think I've got much luck with gambling."

330743	jpn	そしてもう彼女は生きてないのだが、今日の私を育ててくれた家族と一緒に祖母が見ているのを知っている。
330744	jpn	私は今夜、彼らがいなくて寂しい。私の彼らへの借りが計り知れないものだと私は知っている。
330745	jpn	マヤ、アルマ、他の私の全ての兄弟姉妹たちへ、私にくれた助けをどうもありがとう。
330746	jpn	私はとても彼らに感謝している。
330747	jpn	しかしとりわけ、この勝利が誰のものかを私は決して忘れない。あなた方のもの、あなたたちなのだ。
330748	jpn	私はこのポストのもっとも想定できうる候補者では決してなかった。
330749	jpn	我々はそれほどお金も多くなく、支持もないところから始まった。
330750	jpn	我々の運動は、ワシントンのホールから始まったわけではない。
330751	jpn	デモインの裏庭、コンコードの居間、チャールストンの玄関からそれは始まった。
330752	jpn	それは、5ドルや10ドルや20ドルといったごくわずかの貯金を掘り起こした働く人々によってたてられたのだ。
330753	jpn	それは、無関心層の神話を拒否した若者-家と家族から離れ、賃金が安く、睡眠時間も短い仕事をする-からの強さを育てた。
330754	jpn	焼けるような暑さ、ひどい寒さに耐えまったく見知らぬ人にドアをノックししたそれほど若くない人から、自発的に組織され、「人民の、人民による、人民のため政治」が決して地球上に消え去ってないことを二世紀以上後に証明した何百万人ものアメリカ人からの強さを描いた。
330755	jpn	これはあなた方の勝利だ。
330756	jpn	そして私は単に選挙に勝つためにあなた達がこうしたのではないことは分かっている。
330757	jpn	私の為にしたのではないことも分かっている。
330758	jpn	あなたたちが、先に待ちかまえている仕事の困難を理解しているから、やったのだ。
330759	jpn	我々が今夜、祝ったとしても、我々は明日にある課題-二つの戦争、危機的状況にある地球、100年で最悪の金融危機-が人生の中でもっとも大きなものだと私たちは知っている。
330760	jpn	今夜、ここにたったとしても、自らの命を危険に晒してアフガニスタンの山やイラクの砂漠の中で起きているアメリカ人がいることを我々は知っている。
330761	jpn	どうやって住宅ローンを組んだり、医療費を払ったり、子供の大学教育のための貯金をすればよいのだろうかろと子供が寝たあとにも目を覚ましたまま横になり、考える父母がいる。
330762	jpn	利用すべきエネルギー、つくり出すべき雇用、建てるべき学校、対話すべき脅威、修復すべき同盟がある。
330763	jpn	先にある道のりは長い。
330764	jpn	我々の登山は厳しいだろう。
330765	jpn	我々は一年、一期間でさえもそこに到達できないかもしれない。
330766	jpn	しかし、アメリカよ、我々がそこに到達するため私は今夜ほど希望に満ちたことはない。
330767	jpn	私はあなたがたに約束する、国民としての我々はそこに到達すると。
330768	jpn	副作用やフライングがあるだろう。
330769	jpn	私が大統領として行った決定や政策に賛成しようとしない人間もたくさんいるだろう。
330770	jpn	そしてわれわれは政府が全ての問題解決できないことを知っている。
330771	jpn	しかし我々の直面している課題に対して私はいつもあなたたちと一緒に素直になりたい。
330772	jpn	あなた達の声を私は聞こう、特に不賛成の場合には。
330773	jpn	そして、とりわ、この国の再建に加わるように尋ねよう、221年間アメリカにおいて行われたきた唯一の方法-硬くなった手で一つずつブロックを積み上げ、レンガを積み上げるように。
330774	jpn	冬のまっただなかの21ヶ月前に始まったことはこの秋の夜に終わったはずがない。
330775	jpn	この勝利それ自体だけは我々が探し求めている変革ではないのだ。
330776	jpn	それは我々がこの変革を達成ためのただの機会にすぎないのだ。
330777	jpn	そして我々が過去のあったようにもどるとそれは起こらないだろう。
330778	jpn	あなた方の助け、新しい奉仕や犠牲なしにはそれは起こることができない。
330779	jpn	だから我々は新しい愛国心とを喚起して、我々一人ひとりが援助して、一生懸命働き、我々自身ではなく互いに面倒を見る決心する責任を呼び起こそう。
330780	jpn	覚えておこう、もしこの金融危機が我々に何かを教えたのならば、それはメインストリートが苦しんでると同時にウォール街に繁栄はないということを。
330781	jpn	この国で、我々は一つの国として、一つの国民として浮き沈みをするのだ。
330782	jpn	長きにわたって我々の政治を害してきた、党派主義や、狭量さや、未熟さに後ずさりする誘惑に抵抗しよう。
330783	jpn	共和党の旗を初めてホワイトハウスにもっていたのはこの州出身の男性で、その政党は自己依存と個人の自由と国家の統一の価値観にもとづいていたことを思い出そう。
330784	jpn	これらは我々全てが共有している価値観だ。
330785	jpn	民主党が大勝利を納めたが、我々の前進を疎外してきた分断を癒す決断と謙虚さをもって我々は対処しなければならない。
330786	jpn	我々よりはるかに分断されていた国民にリンカンがいったように、我々は敵ではなく友なのだ。
330787	jpn	感情は緊張状態になったかもしれないが、親愛の絆は壊してはならない。
330788	jpn	また、まだ私が支持を獲得していないアメリカ人に言いたい、今夜はあなたがたの票を得られなかったが、あなたがたの声も聞いていく。
330789	jpn	あなた方の助けが必要です。そして私はあなた方の大統領にもなります。
330790	jpn	我々の海岸を越えて見ている人びと、外国の議会や宮殿で見ている人びと、世界の忘れ去られた一角でラジオを取り囲んでいる集まっている人びとへ、我々の物語が異なっているけど、我々の運命は共有されており、新たなアメリカン・リーダーシップの夜明けがきたのです。
330791	jpn	人々、そうこの世界を引き裂こうとしている者へ告ぐ、我々はお前たちを打ち負かす。
330792	jpn	平和と安全を求める人々へ、我々はあなた達を支援します。
330793	jpn	アメリカの光がまだ輝きとして燃えているどうかを疑う人へ、今夜、我々の国の真の強さは軍隊の力や富の規模からではなく、民主主義、自由、機会、不屈の希望といった我々の理想への揺るぎない力から来るともう一度証明した。
330794	jpn	それが真のアメリカの特質である、アメリカは変化できるという。
330795	jpn	我々の統合は完璧にできうる。
330796	jpn	我々がすでに達成していることは明日に何ができるか、何をしなくてはならないかについて、我々に希望を与える。
330797	jpn	この選挙は多くの「初」があり、何世代に渡って語り継がれる物語があった。
330798	jpn	今夜私の頭にあったうちの一つは、アトランタで投票した一人の女性のことです。
330799	jpn	彼女は声を聞いてもらうためにこの選挙で長い列をつくった他の何百万人と同様なのですが、一つ違います、アン・ニクソン・クーパーさんは106歳なのです。
330800	jpn	彼女は奴隷制終了のちょうど一世代後に生まれました。時は道に車もなく、そらに飛行機もなく時代です。その時彼女のような人は二つの理由で投票できませんでした。つまり、彼女が女性であったことと彼女の肌の色からです。
330801	jpn	そして今夜、彼女がアメリカで100年にわたって見てきた全てのものについて考えています。悲嘆や希望、もがきや前進、出来やしないと言われた回数、そしてあのアメリカ的信条を掲げて前進した人々、そう我々はできる、という。
330802	jpn	女性の声が黙殺され、女性の希望は却下されていたその当時、彼女は女性が立ち上がり、声を上げ、選挙権を獲得するのを見ながら生きてきた。

347754	jpn	私たちは今まであまりにも長いこと、あれはできないこれはできないと言われてきました。可能性を疑うよう、シニカルに恐れを抱いて疑うように言われ続けてきました。けれども私たちは今夜、アメリカに答えをもらったおかげで、手を伸ばすことができたのです。歴史を自分たちの手に握るため。より良い日々への希望に向けて、自分たちの手で歴史を変えるために。
347755	jpn	ここまで来るのに、ずいぶん長くかかりました。しかし今日と言うこの日、この夜、この決定的な瞬間に私たちが成し遂げたことのおかげで、アメリカに変化がやってきたのです。
347756	jpn	先ほど少し前に、マケイン上院議員から実に丁重な電話をいただきました。マケイン議員はこの選挙戦を長く、激しく戦ってきた。しかし議員はそのずっと前から、愛するこの国のために、もっと長くもっと激しく戦った人です。マケイン氏がこの国のために払ったすさまじい犠牲のほどを、私たちのほとんどは想像すらできない。勇敢で、わが身を忘れて国に献身するジョン・マケインというリーダーがこれまで国のために尽くし、働いてくれたおかげで、私たちの世界はより良いところになりました。
347757	jpn	私はマケイン議員を称えます。そしてペイリン知事を称えます。マケイン議員たちが成し遂げてきたことを称えます。そしてこれから、この国の約束を再生させるため、マケイン氏たちと共に働くのを楽しみにしています。
347758	jpn	これまでのこの旅路を共にしてくれたパートナーに感謝したい。彼は心を尽くして戦い、（ペンシルベニア州）スクラントンの街で一緒に育った人たちのために語ってきた。デラウェアの自宅に電車で帰る際、一緒に乗り合わせる人たちのために戦ってきた。アメリカの次期副大統領ジョー・バイデンに、私は感謝したい。
347759	jpn	そしてこの国の次のファーストレディ、ミシェル・オバマ。彼女が絶え間なく私を支えてくれなければ、16年前からずっと最高の親友でいてくれた彼女が、礎となって家族を支えてくれた彼女が、私にとって最愛の彼女がいなければ、私は今夜ここに立っていません。

347762	jpn	選対責任者のデビッド・プラフに。この選挙戦の縁の下の英雄。アメリカの歴史でおそらく最高の選挙運動を設計したデビッド・プラフに、感謝したい。
347763	jpn	そして戦略責任者のデビッド・アクセルロッドに。最初からいついかなるときもずっと一緒に歩いてくれた彼に、感謝したい。このために集められた、政治史上最高のチームに。この結果はみなさんのおかげです。この結果を生み出すために、みなさんはたくさんのことを犠牲にしてきた。私はみなさんにいつまでも感謝し続けます。

It began in the backyards of Des Moines, and the living rooms of Concord, and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.

347773	eng	The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we WILL get there.
347775	eng	There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.
347776	eng	But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years; block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.
347777	eng	What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.
347778	eng	Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.
347779	eng	In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.
347780	eng	Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
347781	eng	As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.
347782	eng	And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too.
347783	eng	And all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.

And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.
347786	eng	That's the true genius of America; that America can change. Our Union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
347787	eng	This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.
347788	eng	She was born just a generation past slavery. A time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky, when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman, and because of the color of her skin.
347789	eng	And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America. The heartache and the hope, the struggle and the progress. The times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can.
347790	eng	At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can.
347791	eng	When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can.
347792	eng	When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness, and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can.
347793	eng	She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that "We Shall Overcome." Yes, we can.
347794	eng	A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination.
347795	eng	And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote; because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
347796	eng	Yes, we can.
347797	eng	America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves, if our children should live to see the next century, if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?
347798	eng	This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes,
347799	eng	Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
