317609	eng	I can't help laughing at her.
317610	eng	We must talk her out of this foolish plan.

317615	eng	Need we wait for her?
317616	eng	Do you know her?
317617	eng	Who that knows her doesn't love her?
317618	eng	The better you get to know her, the more you'll like her.

317627	eng	He lured her away from her husband.
317629	eng	He hugged her.
317630	eng	I tried in vain to seduce her.
317631	eng	Trying to tempt her, I gazed into her face.
317632	eng	His vain efforts to seduce her showed he was barking up the wrong tree; she was a mother of two tots.
317633	eng	He loves no one but her.
317634	eng	No one was absent except her.
317635	eng	Her harsh manner of speaking doesn't suit her pretty face.
317636	eng	She's on a roll.
317638	eng	She is not bad in herself.
317639	eng	She has a nice line in self-deprecation.

317658	eng	You must not go there with them.
317659	eng	I felt very sorry that I had put them to so much trouble.

321413	eng	Who are you to talk to me like that?
321414	eng	You're the apple of my eye.

321540	eng	When my father was offered a golden handshake, he took it.
321541	eng	The afternoon sun comes directly into my room.
321542	eng	That's not what I heard. I heard he's patching everything up with his wife.
321543	eng	I was relieved that I could make my broken English understood.
321544	eng	My mother is good at cooking.
321545	eng	Fetch me my hat.
321546	eng	Did you mention my book?
321547	eng	It was your child who tore my book to pieces.
321549	eng	My name is Yatarou.
321550	eng	I'm sure about his name.
321551	eng	I only have eyes for you - honestly.
321552	eng	Everything went black.
321554	eng	My friends were so boozed up that I had to drive them home.
321555	eng	All of my friends like soccer.
321556	eng	If anyone calls me up while I'm away, tell them I'll be back by five.
321557	eng	Please put my room in order while I am out.
321559	eng	I'm not tired at all.
321560	eng	I could read between the lines.
321561	eng	I tried this and that, blending yellow with white powders and obtaining brown, mixing crystals with powders and getting dust, combining liquids with solids and making mud.
321563	eng	I'm much less likely to win her favors than you are.
321564	eng	I've seen a couple of Kurosawa's films.
321565	eng	I am supposed to meet him at four.
321566	eng	I was taken to a circus for the first time.
321567	eng	I consider him to be an excellent teacher.
321568	eng	I asked her to wait a minute.
321569	eng	I offered to help her with her homework.
321570	eng	I prefer travelling by train to flying.
321571	eng	I trusted him with all the money I had.
321572	eng	I have not been able to go to school for a week.
321573	eng	I can not do without this dictionary even for a single day.
321574	eng	I brush my teeth twice a day.
321575	eng	I took Highway 58.
321576	eng	I can't leave work until five.
321577	eng	I get up at six.
321578	eng	I am to meet her on Platform 8.
321579	eng	I gave her my word I would be back home by nine.
321580	eng	I like a GP01Fb better than a GP02.
321581	eng	I take sides with you.
321582	eng	I don't like the atmosphere of that school.
321584	eng	I have got acquainted with them.
321585	eng	I can't play tennis very much.
321586	eng	I feel fine.
321588	eng	I can't even read Italian, let alone write it.
321589	eng	I go by Itch.
321590	eng	I go to bed at ten as a rule.
321591	eng	I'm always looking at you.
321592	eng	I always photograph badly.
321593	eng	I was being taught to cheat.
321594	eng	I have exhausted my energy.
321595	eng	Oh, I didn't like the ending.
321596	eng	I visited my grandmother's house.
321597	eng	I fell asleep before my father came home.
321598	eng	I plan to go skiing with my girlfriend.
321599	eng	I have three cameras.
321600	eng	I am fond of playing the guitar.
321601	eng	I am fond of Cathy.
321602	eng	I meet him at the club.
321603	eng	I gave the bag back to Ken.
321604	eng	I'm not keen on this kind of music.
321607	eng	I haven't seen him for about three years.
321608	eng	I've been going steady with her for three years.
321609	eng	I've wanted this CD player for a long time.
321610	eng	I would like to have this camera.
321611	eng	I'm sick of conferences these days.
321612	eng	I am looking forward to walking around the Izu Peninsula with some of my friends during summer vacation.
321613	eng	I have decided to carry on the work.
321614	eng	I haven't got time to deal with this letter. Could you deal with it?
321615	eng	I am a man of absolute sincerity.
321616	eng	I like this color as well.
321617	eng	I borrowed the book from this library.
321620	eng	I am going to make him a serious offer.
321621	eng	I'm off cigarettes for good.
321622	eng	I don't like to take on any more work.
321623	eng	I can't walk any further.
321624	eng	I saw a marvelous animal act at the circus.
321625	eng	I had to pay 5 dollars in addition.
321626	eng	I thought hard.
321627	eng	I am often in difficulties.
321628	eng	I frequently correspond with her.
321629	eng	I will just hang around here for a while.
321630	eng	I run as fast as Jim.
321631	eng	I like jazz.
321632	eng	I'm going to change my shirt.
321633	eng	I am always leaving my umbrella on the train.
321634	eng	I called Susan to apologize to her, but she hung up on me.
321635	eng	I am thinking of resigning at once.
321636	eng	I started last in the race.
321637	eng	I want more of the steak.
321638	eng	I'm bad at sports.
321639	eng	I went there times without number.
321640	eng	I had intended to go there.
321642	eng	I was enchanted by the performance of the group.
321644	eng	I took a fancy to the singer.
321645	eng	I learned nothing from the teacher.
321646	eng	I have nothing to complain of the conclusion.
321647	eng	I have nothing to do with the matter.
321648	eng	I had never seen so much money.
321649	eng	I was attracted to the girl.
321650	eng	I was amazed at the boy's intelligence.
321651	eng	I agreed to the proposal.
321652	eng	I agree with him on that point.
321653	eng	I gave the poor boy what little money I had with me.
321654	eng	I spent two hours solving the problem.
321655	eng	I cannot silently overlook this problem.
321656	eng	It goes against the grain with me.
321657	eng	I think that it's true.
321658	eng	I know better than to do a thing like that.
321660	eng	I teamed up with Brendon for the doubles tournament.
321661	eng	I just want to glance at the paper.
321662	eng	I ran as fast as possible, but I was not in time for the last train.
321663	eng	I made an awful mistake in the test.
321664	eng	I don't care for television very much.
321666	eng	I prefer listening to the radio to watching television.
321667	eng	I remember locking the door.
321668	eng	I turned the doorknob.
321673	eng	I'm so happy.
321674	eng	I am very dangerous.
321675	eng	I'm as tall as Tom.
321676	eng	I want to make friends with Nancy.
321677	eng	How foolish I am!
321678	eng	I went down to the sports office to sign up for the last position on the basketball team, but somebody else beat me to it.
321679	eng	I like to play basketball.
321680	eng	I go to school by bus.
321682	eng	I had my pocket picked in the bus.
321683	eng	I can play the piano, he thought.
321684	eng	I put it in my head to go there by myself.
321685	eng	Suddenly, my feet stopped.
321687	eng	I felt much more relaxed.
321688	eng	I haven't read the final page of the novel yet.
321689	eng	I have never eaten a mango before.
321690	eng	I still don't wish to see the Styx.
321691	eng	I haven't been able to remember her address.
321692	eng	It gave me quite a shock.
321694	eng	I got along with everybody.
321695	eng	I walked in a contrary direction to everyone else.
321696	eng	I am completely accustomed to this kind of work now.
321697	eng	I can wait no longer.
321698	eng	I'm getting sick of hearing you complain.
321699	eng	I've got to go now.
321700	eng	I have to go now.
321701	eng	I'm fed up with math.
321702	eng	I'm a country boy now.
321703	eng	It's all up with me.
321705	eng	An experiment, I would learn much later, when studying the philosophy of science, had to arise from a real dissatisfaction with existing knowledge.
321706	eng	Mary gave me the ax last night.
321707	eng	I often go to the bookstore.
321708	eng	I am often mistaken for my brother.
321709	eng	I put the lighter out.
321710	eng	I'm thinking of matching you against Yoshida in the race.
321711	eng	I'm fed up with eating in restaurants.
321712	eng	I got up while it was still dark.
321713	eng	I felt after the switch in the dark.
321714	eng	I heard an unusual sound.
321715	eng	I want to be a doctor.
321716	eng	I've got to take my library books back before January 25th.
321717	eng	I gave up smoking a year ago.
321719	eng	Lady luck is smiling on me, and I'll be fine.
321720	eng	I feel more comfortable behind the wheel.
321724	eng	I have to prepare for the test in English.
321728	eng	I've got the devil's own luck in everything.
321729	eng	I've been searching for my puppy for weeks.
321730	eng	I stayed at my uncle's during the summer.
321731	eng	I felt the house shake a little. Didn't you?
321732	eng	I'll stay home.
321733	eng	I don't know what to do with my leisure.
321735	eng	I carried on singing.
321736	eng	I'm patient.
321737	eng	I took to her the moment I met her.
321741	eng	I have got higher grades.
321743	eng	I like vocal music better than instrumental music.
321744	eng	I have a sweet-tooth.
321745	eng	I'm wrong, am I not?
321747	eng	I like instrumental music.
321748	eng	I am nervous in a sense.
321749	eng	I like putting machines together.
321750	eng	I heaved myself up.
321751	eng	I am determined to make a living as a playwright.
321752	eng	I suddenly became very sad.
321753	eng	I made a long journey last year.
321754	eng	I contended against falsehood.
321755	eng	I'm too excited to eat anything.
321756	eng	I took the shortcut back to the woods, locked my shelter, and opened the basket.
321757	eng	I work not so much for money as for the work itself.
321758	eng	I hit on a spa.
321759	eng	I love you all the more for your faults.
321760	eng	I wish I were as smart as you are.
321761	eng	I don't quite agree with you.
321762	eng	I have bought the same camera as you have.
321763	eng	I can swim as well as you.
321767	eng	I caught up with you.
321768	eng	I am afraid I'll be a burden to you.
321769	eng	I am thinking of nothing but you.
321770	eng	I'm not satisfied with what you've done.
321771	eng	I'm your flatmate Paul.
321772	eng	I agree with you absolutely.
321773	eng	I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.
321774	eng	I am concerned for your health.
321775	eng	I can't make out what you're saying.
321777	eng	I don't subscribe to your idea.
321778	eng	I feel resentment against your unwarranted criticism.
321779	eng	I didn't call on you for fear of disturbing you.
321780	eng	I am certain of your success.
321781	eng	I congratulate you on your success.
321782	eng	I'm displeased at your negligence.
321783	eng	I call your name.
321784	eng	I've got everything that you want.
321786	eng	I guess I'm not as smart as you.
321787	eng	I will make you happy.
321790	eng	I support you whole-heartedly.
321791	eng	I've been looking for you.
321793	eng	I'm never late for school.
321794	eng	By no means do I dislike farming.
321795	eng	But I'll never be defeated, never lose my way.
321796	eng	I will never violate a law again.
321797	eng	I'm going to fly to the moon.
321799	eng	I have taught my dog to sit up and beg.
321800	eng	I borrowed Father's hammer to build a dog house.
321801	eng	I looked over my shoulder.
321802	eng	I recognized Mary the moment I saw her.
321805	eng	I do not desert.
321806	eng	I felt that I was being spied on.
321807	eng	I was looking forward to the day when I could see him after five years' separation.
321809	eng	I felt ill at ease in the presence of the principal.
321810	eng	I've been there, and it's not all it's cracked up to be.
321811	eng	I belonged to the harmonica club in my high school days.
321812	eng	I am exhausted with toil.
321813	eng	I want something to drink now.
321814	eng	I want something cold to drink now.
321815	eng	I am in London.
321816	eng	I'm being patient.
321817	eng	I've made up my mind to study harder from now on.
321818	eng	I'll be on duty this Sunday.
321819	eng	I am going to put this machine to the test today.
321820	eng	I am supposed to meet him at four this afternoon.
321821	eng	I am not in the humor for working hard today.
321822	eng	I have a good many things to do today.
321823	eng	I have no energy today.
321825	eng	I intend to listen to it tonight.
321826	eng	I'm left-handed.
321827	eng	I shut my eyes again.
321828	eng	I am interested in chess these days.
321829	eng	I know little of the recent situation.
321830	eng	I made a big mistake in choosing my wife.
321832	eng	I spent two hours watching television last night.
321833	eng	I can put up with a house being untidy but I don't like it to be dirty.
321834	eng	My family comes before my career.
321835	eng	I had a quarrel with my sister.
321836	eng	When I was a child, I was always drinking milk.
321838	eng	I am doing business on a large scale.
321839	eng	I dealt with the accident.
321841	eng	I've already picked out the CD I'm going to buy next.
321842	eng	I tried cycling to work for a while but I didn't take to it.
321843	eng	I could not afford to buy a bicycle, much less a car.
321844	eng	I'm getting sick of the ride.
321845	eng	I persist in my popularity.
321846	eng	I have a dictionary.
321847	eng	I was not being taught to experiment or even to repeat experiments.
321848	eng	I studied my part in the play.
321849	eng	I have two cars.
321850	eng	I'm young.
321851	eng	I wanted to be an inventor when I was young.
321852	eng	I was quick tempered when I was young.
321853	eng	I've come here to help you.
321856	eng	I live above my means.
321857	eng	I looked around me.
321861	eng	I tried to absorb as much of local culture as possible.
321862	eng	I don't mind hot weather.
321863	eng	I'd like to engage in foreign trade in the future.
321864	eng	I am not in the least happy.
321865	eng	I must manage on a small income.
321866	eng	I caught sight of the boy escaping from the classroom.
321867	eng	As a boy I used to lie on my back and look at white clouds.
321868	eng	As a boy, I used to lie on my back on the grass and look at white clouds.
321869	eng	I could hardly keep from laughing.
321870	eng	I want to sleep.
321871	eng	I used to read detective stories before going to bed.
321872	eng	I overslept and was late for school.
321873	eng	I love her from the bottom of my heart.
321876	eng	I am not the captain of the new team.
321878	eng	I'm not very good at swimming.
321881	eng	I realized that I couldn't beat him in math.
321882	eng	I'm going to give up math.
321883	eng	I felt like I was dead.
321884	eng	I have a passion for stones.
321885	eng	I can no more play the violin than a baby can.
321886	eng	I am afraid of what the teacher will say.
321887	eng	I bought this book the other day.
321888	eng	I am able to swim across the river.
321889	eng	I was dazzled by the headlights of an approaching car.
321890	eng	I don't feel like eating at all.
321891	eng	I plan to take up engineering at college.
321892	eng	I get nervous when I speak before a large audience.
321893	eng	I learned many of Takuboku's poems by heart.
321894	eng	I asked him point-blank.
321895	eng	I'll get in.
321896	eng	I'm driving into town so I can drop you off on the way.
321897	eng	I work best under pressure.
321898	eng	I share an apartment with my brother.
321899	eng	I aimed my gun at the target.
321900	eng	I grew up in the country.
321902	eng	I'll be off duty at noon on Saturday.
321903	eng	I don't go by what he says.
321904	eng	I am looking forward to going to the zoo.
321905	eng	I am in pursuit of points.
321907	eng	I sniffed the smell.
321908	eng	I feel for my father, who has to work on Sundays.
321909	eng	I am round shouldered.
321910	eng	I want to ride a horse.
321911	eng	I wanted my hair cut short.
321912	eng	I caught sight of him escaping from that shop.
321913	eng	I am speculating that he may win the game.
321914	eng	I shared a room with him.
321916	eng	I am in no small degree indebted to him.
321917	eng	I urged him to get away and cool down.
321919	eng	I have gotten him into trouble.
321920	eng	I have five times as many stamps as he does.
321921	eng	I don't want to respect a man like him.
321922	eng	I am fed up with his vulgar jokes.
321923	eng	I can't trust in his word.
321925	eng	I can't think of his name.
321926	eng	I think him a fool.
321927	eng	I cannot run faster than he.
321928	eng	I asked him to reconcile them with each other.
321929	eng	I took no little pains to help him out of the difficulty.
321930	eng	I stood for him.
321931	eng	I practiced my English on him.
321933	eng	I took to her.
321934	eng	I expected her to have come yesterday.
321935	eng	I think that she knows the truth.
321936	eng	I'm walking beside her.
321937	eng	I want to marry her.
321938	eng	I'm angry with her.
321939	eng	I made a fuss of her family.
321940	eng	I accompanied her on the piano.
321941	eng	I caught her by the hand.
321942	eng	I took down her telephone number in my notebook.
321943	eng	I was very much surprised by her sudden change of mind.
321944	eng	I was captivated by her beauty.
321945	eng	I prevail on her to have a date with me.
321946	eng	I love her and she loves me.
321948	eng	I like watching planes take off.
321949	eng	I got the short straw.
321950	eng	I may not be all that I should be as a husband.
321951	eng	I don't remember my father's face accurately.
321952	eng	I went there on an errand for Father.
321953	eng	I got nervous on the stage.
321954	eng	I have a cold.
321955	eng	I was disguised in girl's clothes at the school festival.
321956	eng	I belong to the literary circle.
321957	eng	I told the story to anyone who would listen.
321958	eng	I study English two hours a day on an average.
321959	eng	I don't think he's playing with a full deck.
321960	eng	I'll be watching you.
321961	eng	I went on foot only one way.
321962	eng	I am tired from walking.
321963	eng	I almost always play baseball after school.
321964	eng	I have much to do.
321965	eng	I sold my books cheaply.
321966	eng	I mean what I'm saying.
321967	eng	I had my sister take a picture of me.
321968	eng	I am planning to call on Mary the day after tomorrow.
321969	eng	I have many model cars.
321971	eng	I painted the gate blue.
321972	eng	I'm a night owl.
321974	eng	I like walking at night.
321975	eng	I like outdoor sports, such as baseball, tennis and soccer.
321977	eng	I parted from my friend in anger.
321978	eng	I got the pears for nothing.
321979	eng	And you say I don't have a nose for what's popular.
321980	eng	I'm busy preparing for the trip.
321981	eng	At the age of six, I was taken to a circus for the first time.
321982	eng	I also like cake.
321983	eng	Let me join in the game.
321984	eng	I'll join in ten minutes.
321985	eng	Me, too.
321986	eng	Me too. What about playing tennis.
321987	eng	I'm in the same boat.
321988	eng	May I join you?
321989	eng	I am no more happy than you are.
321990	eng	Not only I, but also you are responsible for this accident.
321991	eng	I don't usually take long baths but you're in and out in no time.
321992	eng	I can run as fast.
321993	eng	I felt the same way when I first saw Japan from a plane.

323890	eng	The point is whether I accept or refuse.
323891	eng	The problem was that I had nothing to say to him.
323894	eng	The problem is what to do next.
323896	eng	The question is who made that mistake.
323897	eng	The question is who will do it.
323898	eng	The question is who will make the decision.
323899	eng	The question is: Who will bell the cat.
323900	eng	The question is who will go there for him.
323901	eng	The point is whether he will read the letter.
323902	eng	The question is how he will get the money.
323903	eng	The question is whether he will agree with us.
323904	eng	The question is whether he can be trusted.

323913	eng	The point is that we don't know what is happening around us.
323914	eng	The question is left in abeyance.
323915	eng	The question is whether he will come to visit us next month.

327155	eng	By the way, it also works with the wheel of a wheel mouse.
327156	eng	By the way, my English is absolutely hopeless.
327157	eng	I searched at the pub for the person I had met online, but there was nobody who looked like that.

327168	eng	Sheesh, that Keiko - she's cute or she's hateful, just can't make her out.
327169	eng	Or rather it seems, Kensuke arrived at the studio at the same that I and the other two were still coming.
327170	eng	Or rather, is it not just pathetic that I think such whiny thoughts like this?
327171	eng	Thoughts of being trapped grew stronger.
327172	eng	In other words, he's saying to use the flower vase in place of the urine bottle?
327173	eng	That is, total exhaustion. Body and soul completely knackered.

327175	eng	Dickens' thoughts come across along with the vivid depiction of old London.

327177	eng	I also digitized it and made a desktop image.
327178	eng	If you can, get a sketchbook and a 4B pencil. You don't need such expensive art materials yet.
327179	eng	I tried to make it as cheap as possible.
327180	eng	If at all possible, you should go and look into the matter yourself.
327181	eng	The design was also given the finishing touch to have launch impact and dynamism provided by the novelty of the arch shaped logo design.
327182	eng	Let's have a party with members of the tennis club.
327183	eng	However, Vince, on Jen's house's veranda, was naked from the waist up. He might even have been starkers!
327184	eng	There's no but about it!
327185	eng	But on the day of the mock exams, there are no club activities, so that means I can walk back home with Haruka. And I'm grateful for that.
327186	eng	Theremin: The world's first electronic musical instrument, made by Russian physicist Lev Sergeivitch Termen in 1920.

327189	eng	What sort of current affairs appear in the civil service examination?
327190	eng	I don't know what, but I felt in my heart something that gives me the chills.
327191	eng	No doubt, regardless of the time, she was planning to go to the net café without me if I hadn't arrived first.
327192	eng	I'm sure Taeko was scared and tried to get Yuri to go along with her.

327203	eng	Got cancelled at the last minute. 'Deferred to next week'.
327204	eng	It isn't clear which of them wanted that.
327205	eng	No, no! That's not right.
327206	eng	It's a very good company! The president is a real go-getter and the workers all put in their best.
327207	eng	Anyhow, lunch ... is where I wanted to go but I decided to go to the toilet first.
327208	eng	Tom went splashing through the shallows.
327209	eng	Thanks, I hear you've been taking care of my little brat of a brother.
327210	eng	Please simmer the beans for a while over a low heat.
327211	eng	Whatever you need to talk about, if I will do, I'll answer with loving care.
327212	eng	Whatever the reason, forfeiting the trade that we finally got on track is a fiasco.
327213	eng	Did I say something funny? Did I make a joke?
327214	eng	For some reason economic booms have names taken from Japanese mythology given to them.
327215	eng	For some reason it didn't go well, shot down at every attempt, and he led a sad "History of no girlfriend = Age" life.
327216	eng	I wonder why it is that some plants become annuals and others perennials?
327217	eng	This is not to say that Mr. Tanaka did it all on his own.
327218	eng	I had tried to avoid thinking that as much as possible but as soon as I faced it I started to feel miserable.
327219	eng	I had a nagging feeling that the atmosphere resembled somebody and, now that you mention it, yes, you're right. Certainly ZZ TOP had this kind of feel.
327220	eng	You've run into some trouble or something?
327221	eng	I don't quite follow, but it looks like it will prove tricky. Ergh.
327222	eng	Why don't you leg it?
327223	eng	I wonder why he was suddenly dropped from the team half way through?

327285	eng	Encouraged by the continuing trickle of hits and the rarely arriving email I've somehow kept going till now.

327293	eng	Look at all the mangoes growing on that tree.
327294	eng	We carry out treatments like whitening. We also do tobacco stain removal and other cleaning procedures.

327297	eng	Really - what's up? Where's your go-for-it attitude?

327306	eng	Don't tell me it was really a demand for money from debt collectors?
327307	eng	That you should be stalking Hanako! You'd been quiet recently so I'd let my guard down.
327308	eng	You haven't fallen in love have you!? I won't have it! Having that man become my brother-in-law; I absolutely hate that!
327309	eng	First, we will present a petition to the mayor and collect signatures.
327310	eng	First off, my area of work is mainly in the lower reaches of the Yourou River.
327311	eng	Starting off, first on the agenda is about this morning's two-in-a-bed ruckus.
327312	eng	It's not yet what you'd call finished but we're starting to get pretty good results.
327313	eng	Also as they are in an intimate relationship they are in a situation where it is easy for them to suffer from violence and difficult for them to bring complaints about that to court.
327315	eng	I haven't decided either way. I want to keep an eye on how things go.
327316	eng	It's still minor league but in the not so distant future they'll be coming to a place near you.
327317	eng	It is very important to be careful not to forget them when you leave.

327320	eng	Mitsuna is very tidy so she often cleans up without being asked.
327321	eng	Everybody has their own projects on, so after all you are the only suitable candidate.

327329	eng	Oh, you! If you go around with a face like that, I'll have to demote you back down to 'friend' again.
327330	eng	Enough! I can't get any study done at all!

327333	eng	There's a comparatively large cinema complex inside the mall.
327334	eng	Could it be that her prickly attitude is just because she has period pains? No, couldn't be.
327335	eng	If I drop out of contact, let the police know, OK?
327336	eng	Of course he thought it was a joke and let it slide with a "hm?" but he was seriously annoyed. I mean, just don't say things like that even as a joke!

328046	eng	I'm begging you, could you stop treating me like a pet?
328047	eng	Please enjoy a calm time in a relaxed atmosphere beauty salon.

328074	eng	Please beware of fraudulent emails.
328075	eng	I added Newspaper article frequency data to the 'Kanji list' function.

328080	eng	"Let me get a sample," and she transferred part to a petri dish.
328081	eng	Well now. Are those words to be trusted I wonder?
328082	eng	I sprang out of bed.

328087	eng	"I haven't got the time to keep up with you." "That's rather depressing."

328093	eng	Well, we're neighbours. I'll be popping over all the time.
328094	eng	That's no good! You're tall so you've got to be in the forward defence.
328095	eng	Where did you come up with the idea that I'm familiar with robotics and such I wonder?
328096	eng	A 'commuting wife' is just what the name says, it's a form of marriage where the wife travels to her husband's side.

328107	eng	"Didn't you get married!?" "Oh, we split up. We broke our engagement."
328108	eng	That's pitiful ... don't put on such a death-bed voice from just a body slam.
328109	eng	I also brought some gruel I made. It just needs warming up.
328110	eng	I'll feed it to you so ... here, open wide.
328111	eng	Conversations with the management, reports and such should be very freely interpreted into normal language.
328112	eng	The streets are in full Christmas mode - it's almost Christmas Eve.
328113	eng	Amazing! This moving a story is a first for me! It's truly an epic among epics!
328114	eng	I've already had the entrance ceremony. It's a university alongside the same railway line.
328115	eng	It seems like it will take me a while to get accustomed to life here.
328116	eng	Groaning strangely she is hurling her overflowing passion onto the canvas!
328117	eng	Taking care of the excretory needs of a patient you've just met is a very demanding job.
328118	eng	No dirty jokes!
328119	eng	What, you having bread again? I see you're still leading the same thrilling dietary life as ever.
328120	eng	"What's up? Fidgeting around in front of the house." "Um ... I was waiting for you to come back."
328121	eng	Just how well can masks block the, even smaller than pollen, yellow sand dust? I think it much more of a nuisance than pollen.
328122	eng	By evening, a few clouds had formed.
328123	eng	"Asami was bawling that you had kissed Sanada so" "I didn't bawl!"

328127	eng	The stopcock's turned off.
328128	eng	Well, for the practical problem, in the midst of those rumours flying around I'm surprised they've been able to keep that club running.
328129	eng	I'm sure it's tough taking part in the activities of two clubs, but good luck!
328130	eng	In the darkness, I frantically reach out towards the receding figure.
328131	eng	Don't go back to sleep!
328132	eng	"Situation report." "At present 4 in sight. At most probably 7. Holding small calibre arms."
328133	eng	"Remember here?" "It's where we gathered for going to school in groups."
328134	eng	When I use contacts my eyes feel dry and become red.
328135	eng	We're what they colloquially call a single mother family. I haven't seen my father's face.
328136	eng	Lightly weigh the tofu down, leave it for about 20 minutes then drain.
328137	eng	You're late! Sheesh, dilly-dally dilly-dally ...
328138	eng	I started to think I had behaved foolishly.
328139	eng	OK, this next! The combination of this and this might be way sexy!
328140	eng	Guys that handsome are few and far between.
328141	eng	There aren't many blokes that nice!
328142	eng	Does the applicant have suitable abilities to carry out the job?
328143	eng	"Well, even so my score is far above yours isn't it?" "What did you say!? If I was to go all out you'd be as nothing to me!"
328144	eng	The enemy behind us presently exists solely to cut off our retreat.
328145	eng	We drop off our luggage in a small prefab hut and promptly start preparations.
328146	eng	... Aaah, just how am I supposed to cope with this I wonder?
328147	eng	Since my brother died suddenly two years ago, my sister-in-law has valiantly kept going the small jewellery store he left her.
328148	eng	Hit up on the D-pad, and the background music will change as the background itself becomes the Demon King's castle....
328149	eng	I'd defeated the four sub-bosses and got through the damn long underground labyrinth.
328150	eng	Shurrup! Don't make such a fuss over a little headache. I'm flat out of magical power - this is all your fault!
328151	eng	"Ah, this is my idiot son Takashi" "Eh-er, yes. (The late) Takashi, right?" "Fuusy, he isn't dead yet! Probably."
328152	eng	This, appearing at first glance to be perfectly obvious, is actually very difficult.
328153	eng	Not wanting to boast but I've never got better than a 3 on my report card for home economics. Out of 10 that is.
328154	eng	A-ha-ha ... sorry. I forgot my contacts, Unless I'm right here I can't see it.
328155	eng	However often I phone I can't get through.
328156	eng	Haru's always been like that; he's very kind at heart.
328157	eng	If I'm to become a regular, I have to work twice as hard as the rest.
328158	eng	Beware of 'One Ring' malicious nuisance calls!!
328159	eng	3. If you do phone then hang up immediately, without following any instructions given.
328160	eng	Even making an international phone call from a mobile, if it's Mobila then you can do it for 20 Yen per minute.
328161	eng	That was another impressive fall-flat-on-your-face ... Hey, you alright, Sophie? Can you stand?
328162	eng	That's not what I meant. I'm not being sexist. Men and women are just different.
328163	eng	The other day when I stopped by at a friend's house, it wasn't my friend that came out of the front door, but her husband.
328164	eng	It was your cousin. Second year, current member of student council, club activity is basketball, working as vice captain.
328165	eng	I've set the stage so now you just have to show some guts, OK?
328166	eng	"That's dangerous, I'll clear it up." "It's OK ... Ouch!" "Look, didn't I tell you so?"
328167	eng	If you're with me as a staff officer then I need you to bring a sense of danger with you to your work.
328168	eng	You're considerate, but don't you think you should work a little more at understanding the subtleties of the human mind?
328169	eng	The girl was carrying several books, not textbooks but thick hardback books.
328170	eng	I want you to somehow resolve the situation as promptly and avoiding to cause trouble for my sister and those around us as much as possible.
328171	eng	The website's tagline has to let people know what that business does and how it differs from the competition.
328172	eng	It's the class bell. The pupils that had been around the school gate quickened their steps as one.
328173	eng	"Is that some sort of uniform?" "Oh right, it's because I play field hockey."
328174	eng	As the lesson comes to an end, even if the teacher doesn't say a word of "be quiet", "sit down!," the children naturally return to their seats and quieten down.
328175	eng	The woman dental hygienist said to me, lying down in the chair, "Right, please open your mouth."
328176	eng	Up till now America has called itself the world's police and continued suppression relying on military force.
328178	eng	"Good morning. You're a bit late today aren't you?" "Yes, I ran into a bit of trouble."
328179	eng	It's no joke! It's really a pain, you see.
328180	eng	"By the way, do you know what a Shinto shrine is?" "I've a little bit of knowledge on the subject. It's a religious facility where that which is the object of worship, that called the genius loci, is enshrined."
328184	eng	Yes. I'm pretty sure there are complimentary tickets that haven't been used somewhere.
328185	eng	Not to be taken lightly, local amusement parks. Couples, families, as far as can be seen people, people, people.
328186	eng	A creepy cry that sounds like a human voice, velvet black wings, the image of tearing into dead flesh; crows are known across the world as an ill-omened bird that flies down with ill-luck.
328187	eng	Hey, Cleo. Don't wander around too much, OK? We've only just entered the park.
328188	eng	Despite having lazed around without having touched my work I'm frightened at heart that "Ooh-er, this time I might really not get done in time!?"
328189	eng	Light source, that is what direction the light is facing, also take care with shadowing. Just copy down into the sketch book you have at hand as accurately as possible.
328190	eng	There were figures there from those of an age best called girls and boys to those who looked to be old enough to be about to live out their life span.
328191	eng	To keep holding the barrier up is just to wait for death! So we're going to go out past the wall and counter attack the enemy, you ready!?
328192	eng	The girl, her eyes shining brightly from that single hint, makes her cute cat-motif automatic pencil run across her notebook.
328193	eng	A certain movie was novelized - rather it was a scenario written for a movie that was expanded as a novel and localized to Japanese.
328194	eng	About the same time as he entered the classroom and arrived at his seat, the chime to announce class rings across the school.
328195	eng	That's because they're the classic places for 'something' to appear. Like the grand piano that plays by itself, the human anatomical model that moves by itself ...
328196	eng	Businesses perceive as competitors a narrow range of the business world; there are many cases where they don't understand their real rivals.
328197	eng	If your ability to accomplish a job does not exceed the peak (hump), on the difficulty scale for one job (project), then no matter how long you wait it will not be solved.
328198	eng	"I might like to know about your relations with men." "Relations with men?" "Things like who you get on well with, who you've dated and such."
328199	eng	There were long desks lined up, several pipe chairs, and stuck on the bulletin board were a calendar and several printouts.
328200	eng	"Did I really sigh?" "While giving out an aura of unhappiness."
328201	eng	Shall we go with cornflakes or something light from tomorrow?
328202	eng	It's only manners to tackle all out a game that they have gone all out in creating. Pressing the pause button is just rude!
328203	eng	I had imagined that the newbies fresh from university would probably be stuck with all the backstage work - collecting reference material, getting copies and such but I couldn't have been proved more wrong.
328204	eng	It's obvious but the connection between people is "words". It is by those words that thoughts are shared and arguments carried out.
328205	eng	It's just if we have it every day we're bound to get fed up with it. I must increase the variety of my cooking.
328206	eng	"Well, it's hot again today, isn't it?" "That's one more time you've started with a bland topic."
328207	eng	The other day, a water quality inspection was carried out at our house. We had it done by a certain famous company's Environment Analysis Center or some such name.
328208	eng	Then what is this I wonder? If it isn't dodgy door-to-door sales then could it be a new kind of pickup technique for the ladies?
328209	eng	It was to say that going to the station was too much of a bother after all so I should come to the hotel she's staying at. Good grief, what a selfish woman!
328210	eng	"Ah ... I'm just not feeling so well" "Really? Are you OK?" "Heh-heh. Actually I'm playing hooky."
328211	eng	The exchange unfolding in front of my eyes had not a single millimetre of a gap in which for me to slip.
328212	eng	There is a matter that we would like to discuss urgently regarding club activities, so please come to the staff room.
328213	eng	In addition to the general curriculum there are tutorials in the essentials of machinery, training is also carried out for skills in and learning how to use the various types of machinery.
328214	eng	I have to wrap my sister's dinner in clingfilm.
328215	eng	What on earth spurred them to such an action?
328216	eng	I think that as long as I don't overeat, I will certainly lose weight.
328217	eng	If you skip breakfast and keep lunch light, then in the evening you can have whatever you want.
328218	eng	A gift of cheesecake is apparently good to soothe discord.
328219	eng	We are now going to move to the crematorium so if Mr. Ogawa and you would enter the car ...
328220	eng	Ha-ha, you always stretch when class is over don't you?
328222	eng	Truthfully, if I'd said I didn't have any regrets over my snap decision I'd have been lying.
328223	eng	It's said to be a girls' high school characterised by its quiet and traditional feel and a chic, high-class uniform.
328224	eng	The days after that flew past.
328225	eng	The first thing that came to my attention was the large sofa. It was covered in sober coloured leather, the seat and the back both looked wide and comfortable.
328226	eng	There isn't anybody in front of the main gate yet.
328227	eng	I am still clumsy catching batons thrown high up.
328228	eng	With a pitter-patter of footsteps she runs off to the entrance.
328229	eng	Microfibre cloth is cloth woven from fibres as narrow as a hundredth of the width of a hair.
328230	eng	It was I who found her. She'd lost consciousness so I carried her to the infirmary.
328231	eng	She has a boyfriend she's been going out with since high school but feels their relationship has become a matter of habit and is increasingly dissatisfied.
328232	eng	Get a move on!
328233	eng	Let's have a contest. The side to come up with the worst insult wins.
328234	eng	Dammit, that pest Nagisa, she really went and snitched on me to the teachers.
328235	eng	・ Corrected mistaken/missing characters in the text data.
328236	eng	"Ryu, I can't seeee!" "Naturally, that's because I'm covering your eyes."
328237	eng	"Isn't it about time you tried photographing people or something?" "Eh? Snapshots? I don't know ..."
328238	eng	With that sort of attitude you'll never get past the honourable-mention prizes.
328239	eng	First thing today there's an appointment for a portrait ... what do you say? Will you try doing it as a test?
328240	eng	I quietly take out my camera, so as not to be noticed by my photographic subject, and peek through the finder.
328241	eng	There's no way one that big is going to go on a bike's luggage rest.
328242	eng	Please do your model building at home! The room's full of the smell of lacquer.
328243	eng	As we entered the shopping district Haruna's gaze darted about, just like she was a rustic from the hills, as she looked over the area.
328244	eng	The servants gathered there totalled ... n-nearly one hundred!
328245	eng	"You mustn't be late, OK?" "But if the teacher's late too it doesn't count, right?"
328246	eng	What? You can't do it? You coward! Chicken!
328247	eng	Come on, get walking!
328248	eng	OK, here's the donation ... 10 yen each. Here you go, Mihane.
328249	eng	Last week I was treated to dinner by my friend who'd won at pachinko. It was all-you-can-eat so I ate to my heart's content.
328250	eng	"What is this? An offering?" "That's right. Put it in this offertory box ... and pull this rope."
328251	eng	Well then I'll allow two on a bike, but you peddle. Because I'll be sitting on the luggage platform.
328252	eng	"What're you doing?" "The household books. Our finances are pretty tight so we have to do things properly."
328253	eng	To apply further analysis to documents and files matching the keywords and find the hidden truth is "knowledge".
328254	eng	This autumn I am, unusually, watching many drama series.
328255	eng	"Buy a lottery ticket or something?" "Well, I don't think I've got much luck with gambling."
328256	eng	Essentially it's a one-to-one match, but the content of that match is a level so high as to be unthinkable to an ordinary person.
328257	eng	We're in a slump, barely scraping by, so we certainly don't have the margin to take on a part-time worker.
328258	eng	I'm not going to the library, but I can take you as far as the station.
328259	eng	Paul, we can borrow up to 8 books.
328260	eng	How late can I ring?
328261	eng	Bing-bong ... bing-bong ... "Oh-oh. The class bell!"
328262	eng	Just look! The potatoes are all rolling out! You're a real dullard aren't you?
328263	eng	For my multi-talented sister, able do anything with ease, it seems that my commonplace self is something whose existence she finds very hard to forgive.
328264	eng	"Hey! It's dangerous to run here." "Eh? ... A-a-Aaah!!" "Oh dear, what did I tell you?"
328265	eng	I don't expect him to understand my innermost thoughts but I wonder what I can do to get him to hold an interest.
328266	eng	Even walking till my legs turned to lead I couldn't find one that I liked.
328267	eng	What! You going to take her side again!?
328268	eng	"That's an unusual hobby she's got, the transfer student." "She's cute so it's fine with me."
328269	eng	I sit down crosslegged where Aoi points.
328270	eng	You're a waste of breath!
328271	eng	Crutches are pretty tricky ... "Excuse me, stretcher coming through!"
328272	eng	Don't dodge the issue, I want you to answer my question.
328273	eng	Oh no! I'm late again!! I'm going to get the nickname 'King of Late arrival'.

347741	eng	It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches, in numbers this nation has never seen. By people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference.
347742	eng	It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states. We are, and always will be, the United States of America.
347743	eng	It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long, by so many, to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve, to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.

347753	jpn	シカゴのみなさん、こんばんは。
347754	jpn	私たちは今まであまりにも長いこと、あれはできないこれはできないと言われてきました。可能性を疑うよう、シニカルに恐れを抱いて疑うように言われ続けてきました。けれども私たちは今夜、アメリカに答えをもらったおかげで、手を伸ばすことができたのです。歴史を自分たちの手に握るため。より良い日々への希望に向けて、自分たちの手で歴史を変えるために。
347755	jpn	ここまで来るのに、ずいぶん長くかかりました。しかし今日と言うこの日、この夜、この決定的な瞬間に私たちが成し遂げたことのおかげで、アメリカに変化がやってきたのです。
347756	jpn	先ほど少し前に、マケイン上院議員から実に丁重な電話をいただきました。マケイン議員はこの選挙戦を長く、激しく戦ってきた。しかし議員はそのずっと前から、愛するこの国のために、もっと長くもっと激しく戦った人です。マケイン氏がこの国のために払ったすさまじい犠牲のほどを、私たちのほとんどは想像すらできない。勇敢で、わが身を忘れて国に献身するジョン・マケインというリーダーがこれまで国のために尽くし、働いてくれたおかげで、私たちの世界はより良いところになりました。
347757	jpn	私はマケイン議員を称えます。そしてペイリン知事を称えます。マケイン議員たちが成し遂げてきたことを称えます。そしてこれから、この国の約束を再生させるため、マケイン氏たちと共に働くのを楽しみにしています。
347758	jpn	これまでのこの旅路を共にしてくれたパートナーに感謝したい。彼は心を尽くして戦い、（ペンシルベニア州）スクラントンの街で一緒に育った人たちのために語ってきた。デラウェアの自宅に電車で帰る際、一緒に乗り合わせる人たちのために戦ってきた。アメリカの次期副大統領ジョー・バイデンに、私は感謝したい。
347759	jpn	そしてこの国の次のファーストレディ、ミシェル・オバマ。彼女が絶え間なく私を支えてくれなければ、16年前からずっと最高の親友でいてくれた彼女が、礎となって家族を支えてくれた彼女が、私にとって最愛の彼女がいなければ、私は今夜ここに立っていません。
347760	jpn	サーシャとマリーア。君たちにはちょっと想像もつかないほど、お父さんは君たちを愛しているよ。君たちふたりもがんばったから、約束した通り、ホワイトハウスには、新しく飼う子犬を一緒に連れて行けるよ。
347761	jpn	祖母はもうこの世にはいませんが、いま見守ってくれているはずです。私という人間を作り上げてくれたほかの家族と一緒に、祖母は見守ってくれています。今夜ここに家族のみんながいたらいいのに。それは少し寂しい。両親や祖父母が私に与えてくれたものは、あまりに計り知れない。妹のマヤ、姉のアルマ、そして兄弟や姉妹全員に。これまで支えてくれて本当にありがとう。みんなに感謝します。
347762	jpn	選対責任者のデビッド・プラフに。この選挙戦の縁の下の英雄。アメリカの歴史でおそらく最高の選挙運動を設計したデビッド・プラフに、感謝したい。
347763	jpn	そして戦略責任者のデビッド・アクセルロッドに。最初からいついかなるときもずっと一緒に歩いてくれた彼に、感謝したい。このために集められた、政治史上最高のチームに。この結果はみなさんのおかげです。この結果を生み出すために、みなさんはたくさんのことを犠牲にしてきた。私はみなさんにいつまでも感謝し続けます。
347765	eng	I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines, and the living rooms of Concord, and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.
347766	eng	It drew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy, who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep.
347769	eng	And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me. You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime: two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.
347770	eng	Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, to risk their lives for us.
347771	eng	There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they'll make the mortgage, or pay their doctor's bills, or save enough for their child's college education.
347773	eng	The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we WILL get there.
347775	eng	There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.
347776	eng	But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in America for 221 years; block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.
347777	eng	What began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night. This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were. It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice. So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.
347778	eng	Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything, it's that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.
347779	eng	In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.
347780	eng	Let's remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity. Those are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.
347781	eng	As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.
347782	eng	And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too.
347783	eng	And all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.
347784	eng	To those who would tear the world down: we will defeat you.
347785	eng	To those who seek peace and security. We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright, tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.
347786	eng	That's the true genius of America; that America can change. Our Union can be perfected. What we've already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.
347787	eng	This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election, except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.
347788	eng	She was born just a generation past slavery. A time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky, when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons: because she was a woman, and because of the color of her skin.
347789	eng	And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America. The heartache and the hope, the struggle and the progress. The times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes, we can.
347790	eng	At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes, we can.
347791	eng	When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes, we can.
347792	eng	When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness, and a democracy was saved. Yes, we can.
347793	eng	She was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that "We Shall Overcome." Yes, we can.
347794	eng	A man touched down on the moon. A wall came down in Berlin. A world was connected by our own science and imagination.
347795	eng	And this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote; because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.
347796	eng	Yes, we can.
347797	eng	America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves, if our children should live to see the next century, if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?
347798	eng	This is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes,
347799	eng	Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.
347800	jpn	アメリカは、あらゆることが可能な国です。それを未だに疑う人がいるなら、今夜がその人たちへの答えです。建国の父たちの夢がこの時代にまだ生き続けているかを疑い、この国の民主主義の力を未だに疑う人がいるなら、今晩こそがその人たちへの答えです。

347803	cmn	這是個用這個國家前所未見的，環繞學校、教堂的無數人龍，所說出的答案。這些人苦等三、四個小時投票，許多人還是生平頭一次，因為他們相信，這次一定要不一樣，他們的聲音就是明證。

347837	jpn	それに、みなさんがこの選挙に参加したのは、ただ勝つためではないと分かっています。ただ私のために参加したわけでもないことも、分かっています。今晩みんなでこうやって祝いながらも、私たちは承知しているからです。明日から私たちは、この時代最大の課題に、次々と取り組まなくてはならない。ふたつの戦争。危機にさらされる惑星。100年来で最悪の金融危機。
347838	cmn	我知道你们的所做的一切并不只是为了赢得选举，我也知道你们做这一切并不是为了我。你们这样做是因为你们明白前面的任务有多么艰巨。即便我们今晚欢呼庆祝，我们也知道明天将面临我们一生之中最艰难的挑战——两场战争、一个面临危险的星球，一个世纪以来最严重的金融危机。
347839	jpn	今夜ここにこうして立つ今も、私たちは知っています。イラクの砂漠でいま目覚めようとする勇敢なアメリカ人たちがいることを。アフガニスタンの山岳で目覚めるアメリカ人たちがいることを。彼らが、私たちのために命を危険をさらしていることを。
347840	cmn	就在我们今晚站在这里的时刻，我们知道勇敢的美国士兵在伊拉克的沙漠里和阿富汗的群山中醒来，他们冒着生命危险来保护着我们的生命。

347843	jpn	私たちは、新しいエネルギーを活用しなくてはならない。新しい仕事を創り出さなくてはならない。新しい学校を造り、脅威に立ち向かい、同盟関係を修復しなくてはならない。
347844	cmn	我们需要开发新的能源、创造新的工作岗位，我们需要修建新学校，应对众多威胁、修复与许多国家的盟友关系。
347845	jpn	私たちの前には、長い道のりが待ち受けています。目の前の斜面は急です。目指すところに、1年ではたどりつかないかもしれない。大統領として1期を丸ごと使っても無理かもしれない。しかしアメリカよ、私たちは絶対にたどり着きます。今夜ほどその期待を強くしたことはありません。
347846	cmn	前方的道路将很漫长，我们攀登的脚步会很艰辛。我们可能无法在一年甚至一个任期内实现这些目标，但我从未像今晚这样满怀希望，我们将实现我们的目标。
347847	jpn	みなさんに約束します。私たちは、ひとつの国民として、必ずたどり着きます。
347848	cmn	我向你们承诺——我们作为一个整体将会达成目标。
347849	jpn	けれども私たちがどういう挑戦に直面しているのか、私はいつも必ずみなさんに正直に話します。私は必ず、皆さんの声に耳を傾けます。意見が食い違うときは、特にじっくりと。そして何よりも私は皆さんに、この国の再建に参加するようお願いします。国を建て直すとき、アメリカでは過去221年間、いつも必ず同じようにやってきた。ささくれたタコだらけの手で、ブロックを一枚一枚積み上げ、レンガを一枚一枚積み上げてきたのです。
347850	cmn	但我将总是会向你们坦陈我们所面临的挑战。我会听取你们的意见，尤其是存在不同意见的时候。最重要的是，我会请求你们参与重建这个国家，以美国221年来从未改变的唯一方式-一砖一瓦、同心协力。
347851	jpn	これから先、挫折もあればフライングもあるでしょう。私がこれから大統領として下す全ての決定やすべての政策に賛成できない人は、たくさんいるでしょう。そして政府がすべての問題を解決できるわけではないと、私たちは承知しています。
347852	cmn	我们会遭遇挫折和不成功的起步。我作为总统所做的每项决定或政策，会有许多人持有异议，我们也知道，政府不能解决所有问题。
347853	jpn	21カ月前、真冬の最中に始まったものを、この秋の夜に終らせるわけにはいかない。私たちが求めていた変化は、ただこの勝利だけではありません。この勝利はただ、求めていた変化を実現させるための、そのチャンスを得たに過ぎないのです。そして以前と同じようなやり方に戻ってしまったら、変化の実現などあり得ない。
347854	cmn	21个月前在寒冬所开始的一切不应当在今天这个秋夜结束。今天的选举胜利并不是我们所寻求的改变--这只是我们进行改变的机会。如果我们仍然按照过去的方式行事，我们所寻求的改变将不会发生。没有你们，没有服务和牺牲的新精神，就不可能发生改变。因此，让我们发扬新的爱国和负责精神，所有的人都下定决心参与其中，更加努力地工作，不仅是为自己而是为彼此。
347855	jpn	21カ月前、真冬の最中に始まったものを、この秋の夜に終らせるわけにはいかない。私たちが求めていた変化は、ただこの勝利だけではありません。この勝利はただ、求めていた変化を実現させるための、そのチャンスを得たに過ぎないのです。そして以前と同じようなやり方に戻ってしまったら、変化の実現などあり得ない。みなさんなしでは、変化は実現しない。社会に奉仕するという新しい意欲がなくては、自分を捧げるという新しいスピリットがなくては、変化は実現しないのです。だからこそ私たちは今、新しい愛国心を呼び覚ましましょう。新しい責任感を呼び覚ましましょう。私たち一人ひとりがもっと参加して、もっと一生懸命努力して、自分だけの面倒を見るのではなく、お互いの面倒を見るように。
347856	jpn	今回の金融危機から得たほかでもない教訓というのは、メーン・ストリート（普通の町の中央通り）が苦しんでいるのにウォール・ストリートだけ栄えるなど、そんなことがあってはならないということ。それを忘れずにいましょう。
347857	cmn	让我们记住这一点，如果说这场金融危机教会了我们什么东西的话，那就是我们不可能在金融以外的领域处于困境的同时拥有繁荣兴旺的华尔街。
347858	jpn	この国の私たちは、ひとつの国として、ひとつの国民として、共に栄え、共に苦しむのです。この国の政治をあまりにも長いこと毒で満たしてきた、相変わらずの党派対立やくだらない諍いや未熟さに再び落ちてしまわないよう、その誘惑と戦いましょう。
347859	cmn	在这个国家，我们患难与共。让我们抵制重走老路的诱惑，避免重新回到令美国政治长期深受毒害的党派纷争、小题大作、不成熟的表现。
347860	jpn	共和党の旗を掲げて初めてホワイトハウス入りしたのは、この州の人でした。そのことを思い出しましょう。共和党とは、自助自立に個人の自由、そして国の統一という価値観を掲げて作られた政党です。そうした価値は、私たち全員が共有するものです。そして民主党は確かに今夜、大きな勝利を獲得しましたが、私たちはいささか謙虚に、そして決意を持って、この国の前進を阻んでいた分断を癒すつもりです。
347861	cmn	让我们记住，是伊利诺伊州的一名男子首次将共和党的旗帜扛到了白宫。共和党是建立在自立、个人自由以及国家团结的价值观之上的。这也是我们所有人共同的价值观。虽然民主党今天晚上赢得了巨大的胜利，但我们是以谦卑的态度和弥合阻碍我们进步的分歧的决心赢得这场胜利的
347862	jpn	かつて、今よりもはるかに分断されていた国民にリンカーンが語ったように、私たちは敵ではなく友人なのです。感情はもつれたかもしれないが、だからといってお互いを大事に思う親密な絆を断ち切ってはなりません。

347865	cmn	对于那些现在没有投票给我的美国人，我想说，我可能没有赢得你们的选票，但是我听到了你们的声音，我需要你们的帮助，而且我也将是你们的总统
347866	jpn	この国から遠く離れたところで今夜を見つめているみなさん。外国の議会や宮殿で見ているみなさん、忘れ去られた世界の片隅でひとつのラジオの周りに身を寄せ合っているみなさん、私たちの物語はそれぞれ異なります。けれども私たちはみな、ひとつの運命を共有しているのです。アメリカのリーダーシップはもうすぐ、新たな夜明けを迎えます。
347867	cmn	对于那些彻夜关注美国大选的海外人士，从国会到皇宫，以及在被遗忘的角落里挤在收音机旁的人们，我们的经历虽然各有不同，但是我们的命运是一样的，新的美国领导层已产生了。

347870	jpn	平和と安全を求める人たちにお伝えします。私たちはみなさんを支援します。そしてアメリカと言う希望の灯はかつてのように輝いているのかと、それを疑っていたすべての人たちに告げます。私たちは今夜この夜、再び証明しました。この国の力とは、もてる武器の威力からくるのでもなく、もてる富の巨大さからくるのでもない。この国の力とは、民主主義、自由、機会、そして不屈の希望という私たちの理想がおのずと内包する、その揺るぎない力を源にしているのだと。
347871	cmn	那些追求和平和安全的人们，我们支持你们。那些所有怀疑美国的灯塔能否能像以前一样明亮的人们，今天晚上我们再次证明，我们国家真正的力量并非来自我们武器的威力或财富的规模，而是来自我们理想的持久力量：民主、 自由、机会、不屈服的希望。
347872	jpn	それこそが、アメリカと言う国の素晴らしさです。アメリカは変われるという、まさにそれこそが。私たちのこの連邦は、まだまださらに完璧に近づくことができる。私たちがこれまで達成してきたことを見れば、これから先さらに何ができるか、何をしなくてはならないかについて、希望を抱くことができるのです。
347873	cmn	这才是美国真正的精华——美国能够改变。我们的联邦会日渐完美。我们现在已取得的成就为我们将来能够取得和必须取得的成就增添了希望。
347874	jpn	今回の選挙には色々な「史上初」があり、これから何世代にもわたって語り継がれるいろいろな物語がありました。けれども私が今夜なによりも思い出すのは、アトランタで投票したひとりの女性の物語です。彼女はほかの何百万という人たちと同様に、この選挙に自分の声を反映させようと行列に並びました。ただ１つだけ、ほかの人と違うことがあります。アン・ニクソン・クーパーさんは106歳なのです。
347875	cmn	这次大选创造了多项第一，也诞生了很多将世代流传的故事。但是今天晚上令我难忘的却是在亚特兰大投票的一名妇女：安-尼克松-库波尔。她和其他数百万排队等待投票的选民没有什么差别，除了一点：她已是106岁的高龄。
347876	jpn	奴隷制が終ってから一世代後に、彼女は生まれました。道路を走る自動車もなければ、空を飛ぶ飛行機もなかった時代です。その時代、彼女のような人はふたつの理由から投票できなかった。女性だから。そして皮膚の色ゆえに。
347877	cmn	她出生的那个时代奴隶制度刚刚结束；那时路上没有汽车，天上也没有飞机。当时像她这样的人由于两个原因不能投票，首先她是女性，其次她是黑人。
347878	jpn	さらに私は今晩、アメリカで生きた100年以上の間にクーパーさんが目にした、ありとあらゆる出来事を思っています。心を破られるほどの悲しみ、そして希望。困難と、そして進歩。そんなことはできないと言われ続けたこと。にもかかわらず、ひたむきに前進し続けた人たちのこと。あのいかにもアメリカ的な信条を掲げて。Yes we can。私たちにはできる、と。
347879	cmn	今天晚上，我想到了她在美国过去一百年间所经历的种种：心痛和希望；斗争和进步；在那里时代，我们被告知我们办不到，一些人继续坚信着美国的信念——是的，我们能做到。
347880	jpn	女性は沈黙させられ、女性の希望は否定されていた時代にあって、クーパーさんは生き続け、女性が立ち上がり、声を上げ、そしてついに投票権に手を伸ばすのを目撃したのです。Yes we can。私たちにはできるのです。
347881	cmn	妇女当时没有投票权，她们的希望被挫败，但是安-尼克松-库波尔活着看到妇女们站了起来，看到她们站出来发表自己的见解，看到她们参加大选投票。是的，我们能做到。
347882	jpn	アメリカの大草原に絶望が吹き荒れ、大恐慌が国を覆ったとき、クーパーさんは「新しい契約（ニュー・ディール）」と新しい仕事と新しく共有する目的意識によって、国全体が恐怖そのものを克服する様を目撃しました。Yes we can。私たちにはできるのです。
347883	cmn	当30年代的沙尘暴和大萧条使人们感到绝望时，她看到一个国家用新政、新的就业机会以及对新目标的共同追求战胜恐慌。是的，我们能做到。
347884	jpn	この国の湾に爆弾が落下し、独裁が世界を支配しようとしたとき、時の国民が立ち上がり、偉業を達成し、そして民主主義を救うのをクーパーさんは見ていました。Yes we can。私たちにはできるのです。
347885	cmn	当炸弹袭击了我们的港口、暴政威胁到全世界，她见证了一代美国人的伟大崛起，见证了一个民主国家获得拯救。是的，我们能做到。
347886	jpn	クーパーさんは（人種隔離政策が行われていたアラバマ州）モンゴメリでバスが黒人を差別するのを知り、（同州）バーミングハムで警官が消火ホースの水でもって黒人を抑圧するのを知り、（流血のデモ行進が行われた同州）セルマの橋を知り、そしてアトランタからやってきた牧師と時代を共有しました。アトランタからやってきたその牧師は人々に「We shall overcome（私たちは克服する）」と語った。Yes we can。私たちにはできるのです。
347887	cmn	她看到蒙哥马利通了公共汽车、伯明翰接上了水管、塞尔马建了桥，一位来自亚特兰大的传教士告诉人们：“我们将克服阻力。”是的，我们能做到。
347888	jpn	人が月面に着陸し、ベルリンでは壁が崩壊し、われわれの科学と想像力によって世界はつながりました。
347889	cmn	人类登上月球、柏林墙倒下，世界被我们的科学和想像被连接在一起。
347890	jpn	そして今年、この選挙で、彼女は指でスクリーンに触れ、そして投票したのです。なぜならアメリカで106年生きてきて、幸せな時代も暗い暗い時代もこのアメリカでずっと生きてきて、クーパーさんは知っているからです。このアメリカと言う国が、どれほど変われる国なのか。
347891	cmn	今年，在这场选举中，她用手指触摸屏幕投下自己的选票，因为在美国生活了106年之后，经历了最好的时光和最黑暗的时刻之后，她知道美国如何能够发生变革。

347894	jpn	アメリカよ、私たちはこんなにも遠くまで歩んできました。こんなにもたくさんのことを見てきました。しかしまだまだ、やらなくてはならないことはたくさんあります。だから今夜この夜、改めて自分に問いかけましょう。もしも自分の子供たちが次の世紀を目にするまで生きられたとしたら。もしも私の娘たちが幸運にも、アン・ニクソン・クーパーさんと同じくらい長く生きられたとしたら。娘たちは何を見るのでしょう？　私たちはそれまでにどれだけ進歩できるのでしょうか？
347895	cmn	美国，我们已经走过了一条漫漫长路。我们已经历了很多。但是我们仍有很多事情要做。因此今夜，请让我们自问--如果我们的孩子能够活到下个世纪；如果我的女儿有幸活得和安一样长，她们将会看到怎样的改变？我们将会取得什么样的进步。
347896	cmn	是的，我们能做到
347897	jpn	その問いかけに答えるチャンスを今、私たちは手にしました。今この時こそが、私たちの瞬間です。今この時にこそ、私たちは人々がまた仕事につけるようにしなくてはなりません。子供たちのために、チャンスの扉を開かなくてはなりません。繁栄を取り戻し、平和を推進しなくてはなりません。今この時にこそ、アメリカの夢を取り戻し、基本的な真理を再確認しなくてはなりません。大勢の中にあって、私たちはひとつなのだと。息をし続ける限り、私たちは希望をもち続けるのだと。そして疑り深く悲観し否定する声に対しては、そんなことできないという人たちに対しては、ひとつ国民の魂を端的に象徴するあの不朽の信条でもって、必ずやこう答えましょう。
347898	cmn	现在是我们回答这个问题的机会。这是我们的时刻这是我们的时代--让我们的人民重新就业，为我们的后代敞开机会之门，恢复繁荣，推进和平，重新确立“美国梦”，再次证明这样一个基本的真理：我们是一家人；只要一息尚存，我们就有希望；当我们遇到嘲讽和怀疑，当有人说我们办不到的时候，我们要以这个永恒的信条来回应他们。是的，我们能做到

362257	deu	Die Trauben sind so sauer, dass ich sie nicht essen kann.
362258	deu	Der Krieg beraubte sie ihres Glücks.

362261	deu	Ich gehe ab und zu ins Kino.
362262	deu	Erzähl weiter.
