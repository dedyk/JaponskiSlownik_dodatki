7450612	deu	Der besondere Wert dieser Beobachtung ruht aber in Folgendem: Der Arzt, der einen erwachsenen Nervösen psychoanalytisch behandelt, gelangt durch seine Arbeit des schichtweisen Aufdeckens psychischer Bildungen schließlich zu gewissen Annahmen über die infantile Sexualität, in deren Komponenten er die Triebkräfte aller neurotischen Symptome des späteren Lebens gefunden zu haben glaubt.
7450613	deu	Ich habe diese Annahmen in meinen 1905 veröffentlichen „Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie“ dargelegt; ich weiß, daß sie dem Fernerstehenden ebenso befremdend erscheinen wie dem Psychoanalytiker unabweisbar.
