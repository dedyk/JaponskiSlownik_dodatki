7450608	deu	Die auf den folgenden Blättern darzustellende Kranken- und Heilungsgeschichte eines sehr jugendlichen Patienten entstammt, streng genommen, nicht meiner Beobachtung.
7450609	deu	Ich habe zwar den Plan der Behandlung im ganzen geleitet und auch ein einziges Mal in einem Gespräche mit dem Knaben persönlich eingegriffen; die Behandlung selbst hat aber der Vater des Kleinen durchgeführt, dem ich für die Überlassung seiner Notizen zum Zwecke der Veröffentlichung zu ernstem Danke verpflichtet bin.
7450610	deu	Das Verdienst des Vaters reicht aber weiter; ich meine, es wäre einer anderen Person überhaupt nicht gelungen, das Kind zu solchen Bekenntnissen zu bewegen; die Sachkenntnis, vermöge welcher der Vater die Äußerungen seines 5jährigen Sohnes zu deuten verstand, hätte sich nicht ersetzen lassen, die technischen Schwierigkeiten einer Psychoanalyse in so zartem Alter wären unüberwindbar geblieben.
7450611	deu	Nur die Vereinigung der väterlichen und der ärztlichen Autorität in einer Person, das Zusammentreffen des zärtlichen Interesses mit dem wissenschaftlichen bei derselben, haben es in diesem einen Falle ermöglicht, von der Methode eine Anwendung zu machen, zu welcher sie sonst ungeeignet gewesen wäre.
7450612	deu	Der besondere Wert dieser Beobachtung ruht aber in Folgendem: Der Arzt, der einen erwachsenen Nervösen psychoanalytisch behandelt, gelangt durch seine Arbeit des schichtweisen Aufdeckens psychischer Bildungen schließlich zu gewissen Annahmen über die infantile Sexualität, in deren Komponenten er die Triebkräfte aller neurotischen Symptome des späteren Lebens gefunden zu haben glaubt.
7450613	deu	Ich habe diese Annahmen in meinen 1905 veröffentlichen „Drei Abhandlungen zur Sexualtheorie“ dargelegt; ich weiß, daß sie dem Fernerstehenden ebenso befremdend erscheinen wie dem Psychoanalytiker unabweisbar.
7450614	deu	Auch der Psychoanalytiker darf sich den Wunsch nach einem direkteren, auf kürzerem Wege gewonnenen Beweise jener fundamentalen Sätze eingestehen.
7450615	deu	Sollte es denn unmöglich sein, unmittelbar am Kinde in aller Lebensfrische jene sexuellen Regungen und Wunschbildungen zu erfahren, die wir beim Gealterten mit soviel Mühe aus ihren Verschüttungen ausgraben, von denen wir noch überdies behaupten, daß sie konstitutionelles Gemeingut aller Menschen sind und sich beim Neurotiker nur verstärkt oder verzerrt zeigen?
