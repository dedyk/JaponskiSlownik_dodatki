7131997	eng	Apparently, Tom is going with Mary.
7131998	eng	Do you want to turn around?
7131999	eng	Tom always kept his mouth shut.
7132000	eng	Do you have a waiting list?
7132001	eng	A police officer is talking to Tom.
7132002	eng	Do we need to control this?
7132003	eng	Tom always has a gift for Mary.
7132004	eng	Common sense has prevailed.
7132005	eng	Does Tom often travel on business?
7132006	eng	Can't we just have a drink?
7132007	eng	Tom always finds fault with me.
7132008	eng	Can you define that for me?
7132009	eng	Did Tom and Mary have an argument?
7132010	eng	Can we get out of this jam?
7132011	eng	Tom acknowledged it to be true.
7132012	eng	Can we afford to lose that?
7132013	eng	Today, Tom's life is much better.
7132014	eng	Aren't you dancing tonight?
7132015	eng	Tom and I kissed passionately.
7132016	eng	Are you still a journalist?
7132017	eng	Don't give all the credit to Tom.
7132018	eng	Are you still a Republican?
7132019	eng	Tom and I embraced each other.
7132020	eng	Has all the hype paid off?
7132021	eng	Did Tom really want Mary to sing?
7132022	eng	First day on the job, huh?
7132023	eng	Tom and I clung to each other.
7132024	eng	Don't you get tired of it?
7132025	eng	Did Tom pop the question to Mary?
7132026	eng	Doing that would be silly.
7132027	eng	Tom and I are problem solvers.
7132028	eng	Does your band need a van?
7132029	eng	A few months later, Tom relapsed.
7132030	eng	Does it matter in the end?
7132031	eng	Tom admitted to shooting Mary.
7132032	eng	Do you want to see a show?
7132033	eng	Alcohol is Tom's drug of choice.
7132034	eng	Do you want to believe it?
7132035	eng	Tom admitted having done that.
7132036	eng	Do you still wear glasses?
7132037	eng	Has Tom always been so selfish?
7132038	eng	Do you own this place now?
7132039	eng	Tom and John swapped clothes.
7132040	eng	Do you like being with me?
7132041	eng	Don't expect any less from Tom.
7132042	eng	Do you know your ancestry?
7132043	eng	Tom and I worked like slaves.
7132044	eng	Do you guys see something?
7132045	eng	Do you have any news about Tom?
7132046	eng	Do you even read the news?
7132047	eng	Tom and I needed one another.
7132048	eng	Do we ever really grow up?
7132049	eng	Didn't you know Tom was crying?
7132050	eng	Do I need to spell it out?
7132051	eng	Tom always gets away with it.
7132052	eng	Can we afford to be wrong?
7132053	eng	Did Tom have a fight with Mary?
7132054	eng	Can reform be a bad thing?
7132055	eng	Tom and I never spoke again.
7132056	eng	Can I keep it in the boat?
7132057	eng	Are you serious right now, Tom?
7132058	eng	Avoid people who are sick.
7132059	eng	Tom and I are having supper.
7132060	eng	Are you in the flood zone?
7132061	eng	Have you changed Tom's diaper?
7132062	eng	Are you guys ready for it?
7132063	eng	Tom allegedly murdered Mary.
7132064	eng	Are you getting any sleep?
7132065	eng	Ask Tom what he thought of it.
7132066	eng	Are we ready for the rain?
7132067	eng	Tom advised Mary not to lie.
7132068	eng	Are we on the right track?
7132069	eng	Every day is a party for Tom.
7132070	eng	Are we going to update it?
7132071	eng	Tom adores his grandparents.
7132072	eng	Are video games addictive?
7132073	eng	Embarrassed, Tom backed away.
7132074	eng	Are they going to go west?
7132075	eng	Tom and Mary are available.
7132076	eng	And now what are we to do?
7132077	eng	Can you still make Tom smile?
7132078	eng	Am I going to have a baby?
7132079	eng	Tom and I need one another.
7132080	eng	Can you still make Tom laugh?
7132081	eng	Have you called them yet?
7132082	eng	Tom agreed to let Mary win.
7132083	eng	Everything was as before.
7132084	eng	At least Tom is at peace now.
7132085	eng	Don't you feel important?
7132086	eng	Tom adores his grandfather.
7132087	eng	Doesn't that cause chaos?
7132088	eng	Aren't you interested in Tom?
7132089	eng	Do you need most of them?
7132090	eng	Do you love this country?
7132091	eng	All Tom could do was fake it.
7132092	eng	Do you feel up to a chat?
7132093	eng	Tom became a stock broker.
7132094	eng	Do you ever speak French?
7132095	eng	Deep down Tom is a good guy.
7132096	eng	Did you sleep last night?
7132097	eng	Tom and I went spelunking.
7132098	eng	Did you interrogate them?
7132099	eng	At least let me talk to Tom.
7132100	eng	Could you expand on that?
7132101	eng	Tom and I wanted children.
7132102	eng	Could this get any worse?
7132103	eng	Can I test drive the car?
7132104	eng	Tom and I carved pumpkins.
7132105	eng	Can I express my opinion?
7132106	eng	Certainly Tom was in on it.
7132107	eng	Are you stoned right now?
7132108	eng	Tom and I are backpackers.
7132109	eng	Are you still overweight?
7132110	eng	Today, Tom's life is good.
7132111	eng	Are you not exaggerating?
7132112	eng	Tom always dresses nicely.
7132113	eng	Are you a big sports fan?
7132114	eng	Don't ask me to kiss Tom.
7132115	eng	Are there better options?
7132116	eng	Tom and I took our seats.
7132117	eng	Every year is different.
7132118	eng	Did you have to kiss Tom?
7132119	eng	Don't speak French here.
7132120	eng	Tom always makes excuses.
7132121	eng	Do you know how to kiss?
7132122	eng	A man opened fire on Tom.
7132123	eng	Do you know a good cook?
7132124	eng	Tom always got top marks.
7132125	eng	Can you still hear them?
7132126	eng	Don't ask me to hug Tom.
7132127	eng	Can you still hear that?
7132128	eng	Tom almost lost his life.
7132129	eng	Can we still get a loan?
7132130	eng	Can someone clue Tom in?
7132131	eng	Can I get on this plane?
7132132	eng	Tom acted very strangely.
7132133	eng	Are you happy to see me?
7132134	eng	God has a plan for Tom.
7132135	eng	Are there any discounts?
7132136	eng	French is spoken there.
7132137	eng	Did you really hug Tom?
7132138	eng	Even a fool knows that.
7132139	eng	Tom and I want children.
7132140	eng	Do you ever go running?
7132141	eng	Can I do that with Tom?
7132142	eng	Could I get some juice?
7132143	eng	Tom and I are now alone.
7132144	eng	Aren't you at home now?
7132145	eng	Don't make me hug Tom.
7132146	eng	Does it happen to you?
7132147	eng	Tom always break things.
7132148	eng	Do I look like a fool?
7132149	eng	Did Tom tell you this?
7132150	eng	Come at 2:30 tomorrow.
7132151	eng	Tom admired the flowers.
7132152	eng	Can I get my job back?
7132153	eng	Ask Tom to stop lying.
7132154	eng	Here's what happened.
7132155	eng	Tom and I were in love.
7132156	eng	Here's some evidence.
7132157	eng	At last, Tom appeared.
7132158	eng	Few teachers do that.
7132159	eng	Tom and I tied Mary up.
7132160	eng	Don't just ignore me.
7132161	eng	Has Tom reported it?
7132162	eng	Do you hurt anywhere?
7132163	eng	Tom and I are prepared.
7132164	eng	Can a deal be struck?
7132165	eng	Capture Tom alive.
7132166	eng	Are you standing now?
7132167	eng	Tom and I adopted Mary.
7132168	eng	Are you in the area?
7132169	eng	Did Tom hug Mary?
7132170	eng	Here's the kitchen.
7132171	eng	Tom always made us cry.
7132172	eng	Don't eat my fries.
7132173	eng	Did Tom admit it?
7132174	eng	Do that over again.
7132175	eng	Tom almost didn't cry.
7132176	eng	Bring me some wine.
7132177	eng	Are you like Tom?
7132178	eng	Aren't you at work?
7132179	eng	Tom agreed to testify.
7132180	eng	Are you contagious?
7132181	eng	Get Tom talking.
7132182	eng	Don't you do that?
7132183	eng	Tom acts like a child.
7132184	eng	Do that, will you?
7132185	eng	Do it, Tom.
7132186	eng	Give me some tea.
7132187	eng	Tom acts like a thug.
7132188	eng	Can you go alone?
7132189	eng	Tom actually cried.
7132190	eng	Can I touch this?
7132191	eng	Tom accepted that.
7132192	por	Tom morreu, mas seus pais ainda vivem.
7132193	por	Tom faleceu, deixando seus pais a pranteá-lo.
7132194	por	Os pais de Tom enlutaram-se com a morte do filho.
7132195	kab	Acḥal yelha!
7132196	kab	Acḥal yecbeḥ!
7132197	kab	Acḥal yemleḥ!

7132201	kab	Acḥal d uḥṛic Tom!
7132202	eng	I was hungry and so I made something to eat.
7132203	eng	Tom is an archaeologist, isn't he?
7132204	eng	That's why Tom stayed with us.
7132205	eng	In the meantime, let's listen to some music.
7132206	eng	Tom is still not here yet.
7132207	eng	You need to turn yourself in to the police.
7132208	eng	Why did you hug Tom yesterday?
7132209	eng	You'll eventually to get used to doing that.
7132210	eng	Tom is an honest person, isn't he?
7132211	eng	You'll eventually to get used to doing this.
7132212	eng	Why isn't Tom married already?
7132213	eng	I'll never understand why you didn't do that?
7132214	eng	Tom is the same as always.
7132215	eng	I've been studying French since last October.
7132216	eng	Why wouldn't Tom come tonight?
7132217	eng	How many plumbers do you know?
7132218	eng	Tom is anxious to leave, isn't he?
7132219	eng	I can't remember the last time I spoke to you.
7132220	eng	Did you get that ring from Tom?
7132221	eng	I didn't want to come here, but I came anyway.
7132222	eng	Tom must've been dreaming.
7132223	eng	Why do you want to sell your house?
7132224	eng	Hopefully, Tom doesn't do that.
7132225	eng	It's really rude to chew with your mouth open.
7132226	eng	Tom is away on business, isn't he?
7132227	eng	I was kind of hoping we didn't have to do that.
7132228	eng	I can't believe Tom wrote this.
7132229	eng	It's absolutely critical that we do this right.
7132230	eng	Tom plans to keep working.
7132232	eng	I didn't like Tom at that time.
7132233	eng	I didn't know you were going to like doing that.
7132234	eng	Tom is away on vacation, isn't he?
7132235	eng	I haven't done anything wrong, as far as I know.
7132236	eng	I hope Tom has a good home now.
7132237	eng	It would probably be better if I didn't do that.
7132238	eng	Tom sent me flowers today.
7132239	eng	There are some extra pencils in the desk drawer.
7132240	eng	There are some more pencils in the desk drawer.
7132241	eng	There's a pencil in the desk drawer.
7132242	eng	There are some pencils in the desk drawer.
7132243	eng	Tom has agreed to let Mary do that.
7132244	eng	I first read this book when I was in high school.
7132245	eng	The first time I read this book was when I was in high school.
7132246	eng	Tom is back from Boston, isn't he?
7132247	eng	It would probably be better if we didn't do that.
7132248	eng	I'm in the same club as Tom is.
7132249	eng	Starting tomorrow, everything will be half price.
7132250	eng	Tom shouldn't be drinking.
7132251	eng	What color car do you want to buy?
7132252	eng	If Tom does that, I'll hit him.
7132253	eng	We have some unfinished business to take care of.
7132254	eng	Tom is back on schedule, isn't he?
7132255	eng	It would probably be better if you didn't do that.
7132256	eng	Tom agrees with me on this.
7132257	eng	Can you tell me who drew this picture?
7132258	eng	Tom stole a car in Boston.
7132259	eng	You didn't actually want to go to Boston, did you?
7132260	eng	Tom agrees with me on that.
7132261	eng	I usually take my dogs for a walk in the afternoon.
7132262	eng	Tom is being a nuisance, isn't he?
7132263	eng	I'd rather live in a big city than in a small town.
7132264	eng	It's amazing how Tom does that.
7132265	eng	It's absolute impossible to get any work done here.
7132266	eng	Tom used to hang out here.
7132267	eng	Don't make me eat this.
7132268	eng	Maybe Tom is a little paranoid.
7132269	eng	This is how we're used to doing it.
7132270	eng	Tom is being irrational, isn't he?
7132271	eng	Things don't always happen the way we want them to.
7132272	eng	Perhaps Tom could've done more.
7132273	eng	Is it true you used to be a French teacher?
7132274	eng	Tom wouldn't discuss that.
7132275	eng	I live in Boston now, but I used to live in Chicago.
7132276	eng	Has that ever happened to you?
7132277	eng	Tom is being reasonable, isn't he?
7132278	eng	I sat in the waiting room for what seemed like hours.
7132279	eng	That's what Tom was paid to do.
7132280	eng	It's unrealistic to expect there to be no problems.
7132281	eng	Tom didn't bother me today.
7132282	eng	I'd drunk so much coffee that I couldn't fall asleep.
7132283	eng	There's nothing Tom can't do.
7132284	eng	Are you still waiting for something to happen?
7132285	eng	Tom is being ridiculous, isn't he?
7132286	eng	Are you still planning to go to Boston next weekend?
7132287	eng	We asked Tom if he needed help.
7132288	eng	We're about to go swimming. Would you like to join us?
7132289	eng	Tom doesn't cry very often.
7132290	eng	It's much more expensive to eat out than to eat at home.
7132291	eng	All Tom talks about is baseball.
7132292	eng	You're probably wondering who I'm going to do that with.
7132293	eng	Tom is being supportive, isn't he?
7132294	eng	We need to leave soon if we want to get to home before dark.
7132295	eng	All Tom wants is an opportunity.
7132296	eng	You look happier today than you did the last time I saw you.
7132297	eng	Tom eventually fell asleep.
7132298	eng	The police are still investigating the cause of the accident.
7132299	eng	Apparently Tom has already left.
7132300	eng	I didn't get off the airplane with the rest of the passengers.
7132301	eng	Tom is being very brave, isn't he?
7132302	eng	Don't you think we should leave?
7132303	eng	Apparently, Tom likes chocolate.
7132304	eng	I ate breakfast at the hotel at about seven o'clock this morning.
7132305	eng	Tom had open-heart surgery.
7132306	eng	Did they all go to Boston?
7132307	eng	Tom and I are happy here.
7132308	eng	I heard a familiar voice, but I couldn't remember who it belonged to.
7132309	eng	Tom is between jobs now, isn't he?
7132310	eng	I'll be able to see you tomorrow unless something unexpected happens.
7132311	eng	Eventually, Tom became homeless.
7132312	eng	I didn't know what language the people in the next room were speaking.
7132313	eng	Tom has an aunt named Mary.
7132314	eng	You'll never really know whether you can do that or not until you try.
7132315	eng	Fortunately, Tom didn't do that.
7132316	eng	I didn't make it to the station in time to catch the train I was planning to catch.
7132317	eng	Tom is blind in one eye, isn't he?
7132318	eng	Fortunately, Tom wasn't injured.
7132319	eng	It's grammatically correct, but a native speaker probably wouldn't say it that way.
7132320	eng	Tom hasn't let us down yet.
7132321	eng	If I'd had enough time, I could've seen more of Boston.
7132322	eng	How was Tom supposed to do that?
7132323	eng	If you're free tomorrow, I can show you around Boston.
7132324	eng	Tom is bothered by that, isn't he?
7132325	eng	Has something like this ever happened to you before?
7132326	eng	I already know Tom is a liberal.
7132327	eng	How often does the average Canadian go to a doctor?
7132328	eng	Tom heard someone laughing.
7132329	eng	The only one here who knows how to do that is you.
7132330	eng	I didn't know Tom would kiss me.
7132331	eng	How often does the average Canadian see a doctor?
7132332	eng	Tom is braver than I am, isn't he?
7132333	eng	How often do pilots have to renew their licenses?
7132334	eng	I think Tom has suffered enough.
7132335	eng	Three years ago, I would've done the same thing.
7132336	eng	Tom heard the door opening.
7132337	eng	How are we ever going to get this done in time?
7132338	eng	I think Tom should get an award.
7132339	eng	Are you going to do something about that today?
7132340	eng	Tom is breaking the law, isn't he?
7132341	eng	How many years have you been driving this car?
7132342	eng	I think maybe Tom could do that.
7132343	eng	How many years have you been a French teacher?
7132344	eng	Tom is a pretty bright boy.
7132345	eng	This one is cheaper than that one over there.
7132346	eng	I want to see Tom one last time.
7132347	eng	My right eye is much better than my left eye.
7132348	eng	Tom is building a house, isn't he?
7132349	eng	Is this spaghetti sauce spicy enough for you?
7132350	eng	I'm not sure what Tom did wrong.
7132351	eng	How long did it take the ambulance to arrive?
7132352	eng	Tom is currently a teacher.
7132353	eng	Obviously, I knew that was going to happen.
7132354	eng	I've been very patient with Tom.
7132355	eng	Did you come by car or did you come by bus?
7132356	eng	Tom is college-educated, isn't he?
7132357	eng	Why are you in a hurry to sell your house?
7132358	eng	Why are you in such a hurry to sell your house?
7132359	eng	I've never kissed Tom in public.
7132360	eng	Maybe you and I can travel together again.
7132361	eng	Tom is finished doing that.
7132362	eng	It only takes me three minutes to do that.
7132363	eng	If Tom wants to do that, he can.
7132364	eng	How long did it take the police to arrive?
7132365	eng	Tom is coming back soon, isn't he?
7132366	eng	You should do something about that today.
7132367	eng	It doesn't matter what Tom says.
7132368	eng	This is cheaper than that one over there.
7132369	eng	Tom is going to assist you.
7132370	eng	My dog doesn't get along with other dogs.
7132371	eng	My dog doesn't get along well with other dogs.
7132372	eng	Tom is coming home soon, isn't he?
7132373	eng	Can you tell me who painted this picture?
7132374	eng	Tom is going to be rescued.
7132375	eng	Are you still looking for an interpreter?
7132376	eng	It's natural Tom should be here.
7132377	eng	We should do something about that today.
7132378	eng	Tom is coming next week, isn't he?
7132379	eng	Is there enough room for me in your car?
7132380	eng	It looks like Tom is doing that.
7132381	eng	It looked like Tom was going to do that.
7132382	eng	How can you tell if a pineapple is ripe?
7132383	eng	Tom is still not there yet.
7132384	eng	Usually we're not very busy on Mondays.
7132385	eng	Tom and I are having a good time here.
7132386	eng	How many years have you been a plumber?
7132387	eng	Tom is coming on Monday, isn't he?
7132388	eng	How can I avoid getting eye infections?
7132389	eng	That's what Tom would've wanted.
7132390	eng	This medicine doesn't taste very good.
7132391	eng	Tom is way behind schedule.
7132392	eng	My part-time job is delivering pizzas.
7132393	eng	This is right where Tom belongs.
7132394	eng	Monday is our busiest day of the week.
7132395	eng	Tom is coming to Boston, isn't he?
7132396	eng	Is it true you used to live in Boston?
7132397	eng	Unfortunately Tom isn't healthy.
7132398	eng	Tickets can be purchased at the door.
7132399	eng	Where are you going to meet Tom?
7132400	eng	That's one less thing to worry about.
7132401	eng	That's one less thing we need to worry about.
7132402	eng	Tom is coming to get us, isn't he?
7132403	eng	How often do you update your website?
7132404	eng	Apparently, Tom has lost his job.
7132405	eng	How often do you speak to each other?
7132406	eng	Tom opened his desk drawer.
7132407	eng	Were you able to pay for everything?
7132408	eng	One of Tom's neighbors heard him scream.
7132409	eng	Let's do something about that today.
7132410	eng	Tom is considering that, isn't he?
7132411	eng	It's hard to do homework on the bus.
7132412	eng	Evidently, Tom wasn't interested.
7132413	eng	Isn't it about time you got married?
7132414	eng	Isn't it about time you two got married?
7132415	eng	Tom played outside all day.
7132416	eng	Calm down and tell us what happened.
7132417	eng	Frankly, Tom isn't doing so well.
7132418	eng	Was the money I gave you enough?
7132419	eng	Tom is crying right now, isn't he?
7132420	eng	Do you have snow tires on your car?
7132421	eng	Tom isn't going to testify.
7132422	eng	This is a picture of my first car.
7132423	eng	Tom prefers to study alone.
7132424	eng	Let's do that while we're waiting.
7132425	eng	I don't know where Tom lives now.
7132426	eng	It took us three hours to do that.
7132427	eng	Tom is deluding himself, isn't he?
7132428	eng	I don't know where Tom works now.
7132429	eng	How many years have you been here?
7132430	eng	Tom shot one of the guards.
7132431	eng	How long have you been a plumber?
7132432	eng	I had a long talk with Tom today.
7132433	eng	How do they expect me to do that?
7132434	eng	Tom is doing a good job, isn't he?
7132435	eng	Do you have a license to do that?
7132436	eng	I think Tom will do what's right.
7132437	eng	Are we still obliged to go there?
7132438	eng	Tom should've stayed quiet.
7132439	eng	Please tell us where to go next.
7132440	eng	I went to the same place as Tom did.
7132441	eng	Please tell us what's happening.
7132442	eng	Tom is doing all he can, isn't he?
7132443	eng	How often do you see each other?
7132444	eng	If Tom does that, he'll be fired.
7132445	eng	How do you guys feel about that?
7132446	eng	Tom wanted to surprise you.
7132447	eng	Aren't you living in Boston now?
7132448	eng	It seems Tom may be disappointed.
7132449	eng	Are we still obliged to do that?
7132450	eng	Tom is doing quite well, isn't he?
7132451	eng	What's your favorite quotation?
7132452	eng	The money you gave me wasn't enough to pay all the bills.
7132453	eng	If I'd had three dollars more, I could've paid the bill.
7132454	kab	Eyya-w ad narem kra.
7132455	eng	Let's wait and see what Tom says.
7132456	eng	The situation is getting worse.
7132457	eng	Tom was executed on Monday.
7132458	eng	How gullible do you think I am?
7132459	eng	Maybe Tom never got your message.
7132460	eng	How can I become a billionaire?
7132461	eng	Tom is doing that again, isn't he?
7132462	eng	Are you ready for cold weather?
7132463	eng	Maybe Tom wants to surprise Mary.
7132464	eng	Why did you choose to do that?
7132465	eng	Tom didn't open any windows.
7132466	eng	Do you still drive a blue car?
7132467	eng	Most people thought Tom was nuts.
7132468	eng	All these pictures are of you.
7132469	eng	Tom is doing that today, isn't he?
7132470	eng	That's particularly alarming.
7132471	eng	Perhaps Tom should've left early.
7132472	eng	That's one way of putting it.
7132473	eng	Tom didn't try to stop Mary.
7132474	eng	Monday was a busy day for us.
7132475	eng	So far, Tom hasn't done anything.
7132476	eng	Monday was a busy day for me.
7132477	eng	Tom is doing that wrong, isn't he?
7132478	eng	Didn't you do that on Monday?
7132479	eng	Tom and I just wanted to be left alone.
7132480	eng	All the curtains were closed.
7132481	eng	Tom has an uncle named John.
7132482	eng	The rain spoiled our plans.
7132483	eng	That's exactly what Tom is doing.
7132484	eng	That was really easy to do.
7132485	eng	Tom is doing the dishes, isn't he?
7132486	eng	Please tell us where to go.
7132487	eng	That's how Tom's made his living.
7132488	eng	How exactly do you do that?
7132489	eng	Tom hasn't been cooperating.
7132490	eng	How did this sand get here?
7132491	eng	Tom and I finally did that.
7132492	eng	How can you be so gullible?
7132493	eng	Tom is down with a cold, isn't he?
7132494	eng	How can people be so cruel?
7132495	eng	Tom and John were in jail together.
7132496	eng	That goal is unattainable.
7132497	eng	Tom is awfully good-looking.
7132498	eng	How will you pay for this?
7132499	eng	That's why Tom didn't get killed.
7132500	eng	Did you get there in time?
7132501	eng	Tom is eager to do that, isn't he?
7132502	eng	Three spoons are missing.
7132503	eng	We don't know how Tom will react.
7132504	eng	It'll be easy to do this.
7132505	eng	Tom has lied to Mary many times.
7132506	eng	Should we do that first?
7132507	eng	Shouldn't we do that first?
7132508	eng	Apparently, Tom is smarter than us.
7132509	eng	Apparently, Tom is much smarter than us.
7132510	eng	Is there another option?
7132511	eng	Tom is easily flattered, isn't he?
7132512	eng	Am I obliged to do that?
7132513	eng	Apparently, Tom is still employed.
7132514	eng	The sky has cleared up.
7132515	eng	Tom might've been kidnapped.
7132516	eng	That's pretty powerful.
7132517	eng	A neighbor heard Tom's screams.
7132518	eng	That's pretty exciting.
7132519	eng	Tom is eating lunch now, isn't he?
7132520	eng	That's pretty dramatic.
7132521	eng	Tom and I know why Mary cried.
7132522	eng	That's our arrangement.
7132523	eng	Tom needs professional help.
7132524	eng	Should we do that now?
7132525	eng	I didn't need to do that with Tom.
7132526	eng	It's too hot to sleep.
7132527	eng	Tom is enjoying himself, isn't he?
7132528	eng	How much is the toll?
7132529	eng	Tom and I speak French to each other.
7132530	eng	Do you have a backup?
7132531	eng	Tom never laid a hand on me.
7132532	eng	That's believable.
7132533	eng	I know where Tom has been staying.
7132534	eng	The bus stopped.

7134489	eng	Tom told us a bizarre story.
7134490	eng	I'm very optimistic about our future here.
7134491	eng	Some people think Tom is innocent.
7134492	eng	I feel like that would be a waste of time.
7134493	eng	I feel that would be a waste of time.
7134494	eng	Tom is fun to be around, isn't he?
7134495	eng	We're not going to make money doing this.
7134496	eng	We're not going to make much money doing this.
7134497	eng	That's something Tom shouldn't do.
7134498	eng	It was hard to get out of bed to morning.
7134499	eng	Tom told us a strange story.
7134500	eng	I'm not really sure who I should talk to.
7134501	eng	That's something Tom wanted to do.
7134502	eng	I'm not even going to attempt to do that.
7134503	eng	Tom is fun to work with, isn't he?
7134504	eng	I'm not really sure where I should park.
7134505	eng	Tom would know, wouldn't he?
7134506	eng	We've been living here for a long time.
7134507	eng	We didn't invite Tom to the party.
7134508	eng	Maybe I'll be able to do that tomorrow.
7134509	eng	Tom is getting stronger, isn't he?
7134510	eng	I'm waiting to see how things turn out.
7134511	eng	Hopefully, Tom hasn't been injured.
7134512	eng	I definitely want to do that on Monday.
7134513	eng	Tom came to ask for our help.
7134514	eng	I can't answer that question right now.
7134515	eng	I think Tom has learned his lesson.
7134516	eng	I, for one, am not worried about that.
7134517	eng	Tom is going to Harvard, isn't he?
7134518	eng	I'm not really sure what I need to do.
7134520	eng	I'm not really sure what I have to do.
7134521	eng	Tom didn't forget to do that.
7134522	eng	I work with homeless people every day.
7134523	eng	In 2013, Tom returned to Australia.
7134524	eng	I didn't want to do that, so I didn't.
7134525	eng	Tom is going to be back, isn't he?
7134526	eng	Tom is going to be back soon, isn't he?
7134527	eng	I'm not really sure who I should ask.
7134528	eng	It was fun watching Tom doing that.
7134529	eng	I'm not really sure what I should do.
7134530	eng	Tom didn't seem very relaxed.
7134531	eng	I'm looking forward to the challenge.
7134532	eng	It's very likely Tom will be there.
7134533	eng	I was only in Boston for three weeks.
7134534	eng	Tom is going to be busy, isn't he?
7134535	eng	I normally don't do things like this.
7134536	eng	I don't normally do things like this.
7134537	eng	Tom doesn't worry about that.
7134538	eng	I couldn't do that without your help.
7134539	eng	Just then Tom walked into the room.
7134540	eng	I'm very optimistic about my future.
7134541	eng	Tom is going to be fine, isn't he?
7134542	eng	I'm hoping to finish in the top ten.
7134543	eng	Look, I know Tom is here somewhere.
7134544	eng	I didn't expect to be so successful.
7134545	eng	Tom got here after Mary left.
7134546	eng	I, for one, don't worry about that.
7134547	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know we've moved.
7134548	eng	I've got more important work to do.
7134549	eng	Tom is going to be here, isn't he?
7134550	eng	Tom is going to be here all day, isn't he?
7134551	eng	I'm waiting to see how it all goes.
7134552	eng	Maybe Tom should move to Australia.
7134553	eng	I'm not even going to attempt that.
7134554	eng	Tom has an enormous appetite.
7134555	eng	I'm actually very excited about it.
7134556	eng	Maybe Tom shouldn't have done that.
7134557	eng	I wasn't really worried about that.
7134558	eng	Tom is going to be late, isn't he?
7134559	eng	I still don't have all the answers.
7134560	eng	Maybe Tom will sell you his guitar.
7134561	eng	Maybe Tom will sell you one of his guitars.
7134562	eng	I don't have much of a social life.
7134563	eng	Tom has decided to re-enlist.
7134564	eng	I can't think about retirement yet.
7134565	eng	No doubt Tom will enjoy doing that.
7134566	eng	I'm very, very concerned about it.
7134567	eng	Tom is going to be next, isn't he?
7134568	eng	I need to have another surgery.
7134569	eng	Of course Tom isn't going anywhere.
7134570	eng	I'll enjoy doing that while I can.
7134571	eng	Tom is almost always correct.
7134572	eng	I was lucky to be able to do that.
7134573	eng	I was lucky to be allowed to do that.
7134574	eng	Of course, Tom would never do that.
7134575	eng	I want to see that happen someday.
7134576	eng	Tom is going to fill in, isn't he?
7134577	eng	We're asking the public for help.
7134578	eng	So far, Tom hasn't been successful.
7134579	eng	I, for one, don't worry about it.
7134580	eng	Tom is going to come save us.
7134581	eng	I'm trying not to think about it.
7134582	eng	That doesn't mean Tom has given up.
7134583	eng	I'm too old to have children now.
7134584	eng	Tom is going to find us, isn't he?
7134585	eng	I'm not really sure who did that.
7134586	eng	That's probably why Tom was crying.
7134587	eng	I'm not really sure what's wrong.
7134588	eng	Tom is having fun doing that.
7134589	eng	I'm kind of speechless right now.
7134590	eng	The room Tom wants isn't available.
7134591	eng	I plan on doing better next year.
7134592	eng	Tom is going to get one, isn't he?
7134593	eng	I feel like I know my way around.
7134594	eng	You should never have let Tom sing.
7134595	eng	I can't answer that question now.
7134596	eng	Tom is hoping that'll happen.
7134597	eng	We're very concerned about that.
7134598	eng	Apparently, Tom faked his own death.
7134599	eng	We're not asking you to do that.
7134600	eng	Tom is going to give up, isn't he?
7134601	eng	We're grateful for all the help.
7134602	eng	Do you still think Tom should leave?
7134603	eng	I'm waiting to see what happens.
7134604	eng	Tom is staying at a friend's.
7134605	eng	I'm going to give all this away.
7134606	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to sing.
7134607	eng	I haven't been losing any sleep.
7134608	eng	Tom is going to go home, isn't he?
7134609	eng	I couldn't do that without help.
7134610	eng	Is there anything Tom wouldn't do?
7134611	eng	I'm very happy to be in Boston.
7134612	eng	Tom looks like he's troubled.
7134613	eng	I'm not really sure what to do.
7134614	eng	I'm sure Tom isn't going to do that.
7134615	eng	I'll be here tomorrow, I think.
7134616	eng	Tom is going to hear us, isn't he?
7134617	eng	I was glad to get it over with.
7134618	eng	If Tom ever does that, I'll hit him.
7134619	eng	If Tom ever does that, I'll slap him.
7134620	eng	I try to contribute when I can.
7134621	eng	Tom must not have been there.
7134622	eng	I thank God that didn't happen.
7134623	eng	In 2013, Tom emigrated to Australia.
7134624	eng	I can't sit still for too long.
7134625	eng	I can't sit still for very long.
7134626	eng	Tom is going to help me, isn't he?
7134627	eng	I can vote against it, I guess.
7134628	eng	It's very likely Tom won't be there.
7134629	eng	It's very unlikely Tom will be there.
7134630	eng	I think we're making progress.
7134631	eng	Tom never spoke French again.
7134632	eng	I need to get back there fast.
7134633	eng	Luckily, Tom was there to help Mary.
7134634	eng	I don't want to get into that.
7134635	eng	Maybe Tom knows what Mary has to do.
7134636	eng	Maybe Tom knows what Mary needs to do.
7134637	eng	Maybe Tom knows what Mary should do.
7134638	eng	I don't care about that stuff.
7134639	eng	Tom should refuse to do that.
7134640	eng	We're planning for the worst.
7134641	eng	Maybe you should tell Tom the truth.
7134642	eng	Maybe you ought to tell Tom the truth.
7134643	eng	We're considering doing that.
7134644	eng	Tom is going to pay you, isn't he?
7134645	eng	We're actually working on it.
7134646	eng	Unfortunately, Tom is usually right.
7134647	eng	I'm not sure they'll survive.
7134648	eng	Tom started whistling a tune.
7134649	eng	I was prepared for the worst.
7134650	eng	Tom is going to like it, isn't he?
7134651	eng	I still don't sleep at night.
7134652	eng	Tom is going to recover, isn't he?
7134653	eng	I only wanted to help people.
7134654	eng	You know how poor Tom is, don't you?
7134655	eng	We're going to be all right.
7134656	eng	Tom told Mary to go upstairs.
7134657	eng	Tom told Mary that she should go upstairs.
7134658	eng	It's obviously not over yet.
7134659	eng	Apparently, Tom has the same problem.
7134660	eng	I'm very concerned about it.
7134661	eng	Tom is going to save us, isn't he?
7134662	eng	I'm very proud of our team.
7134663	eng	As a matter of fact, Tom did do that.
7134664	eng	I was pretty happy with it.
7134665	eng	Tom told Mary what he wanted.
7134666	eng	I don't go home very often.
7134667	eng	Tom is going to say yes, isn't he?
7134668	eng	I don't go home that often.
7134669	eng	Fortunately, Tom was able to do that.
7134670	eng	I'm very proud of my team.
7134671	eng	Tom wanted to see Mary laugh.
7134672	eng	I'll enjoy it while I can.
7134673	eng	I'm enjoying it while I can.
7134674	eng	Tom is going to show up, isn't he?
7134675	eng	I wanted to say thank you.
7134676	eng	Fortunately, Tom didn't say anything.
7134677	eng	I feel good at this point.
7134678	eng	Tom wanted to see Mary smile.
7134679	eng	We don't anticipate that.
7134680	eng	I wanted to believe what Tom told me.
7134681	eng	I was lucky to be chosen.
7134682	eng	Tom is going to sign it, isn't he?
7134683	eng	Tom is going to sign the contract, isn't he?
7134684	eng	I love it here in Boston.
7134685	eng	I wish I could've told Tom the truth.
7134686	eng	That's the key question.
7134687	eng	Tom can't understand French yet.
7134688	eng	It's tough to say why.
7134689	eng	It sounds like Tom deserves an award.
7134690	eng	I was really nervous.
7134691	eng	Tom is going to succeed, isn't he?
7134692	eng	I pled guilty.
7134693	eng	It was obvious Tom had been drinking.
7134695	eng	I hope we win the championship.
7134696	eng	I hope we win that championship.
7134697	eng	I still can't believe that we won.
7134698	eng	I don't think I've ever been so happy.
7134699	eng	I don't think that I've ever been so happy.
7134700	eng	I don't think it makes a huge difference.
7134701	eng	I don't think that it makes a huge difference.
7134702	eng	I don't think it makes much difference.
7134703	eng	I don't think that it makes much difference.
7134704	eng	I don't think it'll make much difference.
7134705	eng	I don't think that it'll make much difference.

7134711	eng	I knew that I ought to do something differently.
7134712	eng	I knew I should do something differently.
7134713	eng	I knew that I should do something differently.

7134722	eng	I always thought we could keep this secret.
7134723	eng	I always thought that we could keep this secret.
7134724	eng	I was hoping we could keep this secret.
7134725	eng	I was hoping that we could keep this secret.
7134726	eng	I just don't believe everybody needs to do that.
7134727	eng	I just don't believe that everybody needs to do that.
7134728	eng	I'm very happy with the way I played.
7134729	eng	I'm very happy with the way that I played.
7134730	eng	Just then Tom heard someone laughing.
7134731	eng	Just then Tom heard somebody laughing.
7134732	eng	I think Tom may have been intoxicated.
7134733	eng	I think that Tom may have been intoxicated.
7134734	eng	I think Tom may have been drunk.
7134735	eng	I think that Tom may have been drunk.
7134736	eng	I think Tom said something about that.
7134737	eng	I think that Tom said something about that.
7134738	eng	Tom couldn't sleep on the bus.
7134739	eng	I think the team is capable of more.
7134740	eng	It's a good thing Tom didn't do that.
7134741	eng	I'm proud to be on this team.
7134742	eng	Tom is going to survive, isn't he?
7134743	eng	I'm having a pretty good season.
7134744	eng	Tom decided to study medicine.
7134745	eng	I'm going to miss my teammates.
7134746	eng	Tom has decided to study medicine.
7134747	eng	I was pleased with how we played today.
7134748	eng	Most likely Tom will be back by 2:30.
7134749	eng	I'm not really happy with what I did.
7134750	eng	Tom is good at baseball, isn't he?
7134751	eng	I'm not going to take all the credit.
7134752	eng	Obviously, Tom knows what he's doing.
7134753	eng	I wasn't really thinking about it too much.
7134754	eng	Tom did that just a month ago.
7134755	eng	I want to ask you for forgiveness.
7134756	eng	So far, Tom hasn't received anything.
7134757	eng	I think we'll get a lot of proposals.
7134758	eng	Tom is good at juggling, isn't he?
7134759	eng	I think the mayor's done a good job.
7134760	eng	The person who was killed wasn't Tom.
7134761	eng	I ran into a parking meter last week.
7134762	eng	Tom didn't say where Mary was.
7134763	eng	I heard stories that broke my heart.
7134764	eng	Do you still think Tom should do that?
7134765	eng	I have no idea what their plans are.
7134766	eng	Tom is good at painting, isn't he?
7134767	eng	I have a sick feeling in my stomach.
7134768	eng	Has Tom ever attempted suicide before?
7134769	eng	I guess that's something we could do.
7134770	eng	Is this the first time Tom has attempted suicide?
7134771	eng	I don't see any major technical problems.
7134772	eng	Tom is married to my daughter.
7134773	eng	I don't know whether to smile or cry.
7134774	eng	Tom is good at swimming, isn't he?
7134775	eng	I didn't start out trying to do this.
7134776	eng	Tom is terrible at doing that.

7136999	eng	I certainly wouldn't have left Boston if I didn't have to.
7137000	eng	It seems like Tom should've done that.
7137001	eng	We were thirty miles from Boston when we got a flat tire.
7137002	eng	Tom looked down into the well.
7137003	eng	I know a lot about Boston after living here thirty years.
7137004	eng	Last fall, Tom had open-heart surgery.
7137005	eng	I didn't know I was going to fall in love here in Boston.
7137006	eng	Tom is having a bad day, isn't he?
7137007	eng	I don't think as many people as you think will be there.
7137008	eng	Let's wait and see what Tom does next.
7137009	eng	I didn't think I'd be able to find a job here in Boston.
7137010	eng	Tom needs to be more positive.
7137011	eng	We just have to wait and see if that's going to happen.
7137012	eng	Maybe Tom just doesn't like Australia.
7137013	eng	The majority of students didn't know what was going on.
7137014	eng	Tom is heading this way, isn't he?
7137015	eng	The doctor said to take it easy for the next few days.
7137016	eng	We've always had a lot of fun when we visited Boston.
7137017	eng	Tom never laid a hand on Mary.
7137018	eng	That was the first time I heard people talk about it.
7137019	eng	Maybe Tom knows what Mary wants to do.
7137020	eng	We'll be leaving Boston before the end of the month.
7137021	eng	Tom is helping us today, isn't he?
7137022	eng	We just have to wait and see what's going to happen.
7137023	eng	Perhaps that's what Tom's waiting for.
7137024	eng	Most of the students didn't know what was happening.
7137025	eng	Tom parked in the parking lot.
7137026	eng	I'm not sure Boston is where I want to be right now.
7137027	eng	Right now Tom is a little preoccupied.
7137028	eng	I don't expect to be as busy tomorrow as I am today.
7137029	eng	Tom is here for the day, isn't he?
7137030	eng	I can't 100% guarantee that I'll be there on Monday.
7137031	eng	Sometimes I'm right, sometimes Tom is.
7137032	eng	Things turned out better than I thought they would.
7137033	eng	Tom says he knows who Mary is.
7137034	eng	I think this one is probably the better of the two.
7137035	eng	Thankfully, Tom respected my decision.
7137036	eng	I spend about three hours a week cleaning my house.
7137037	eng	Tom is here on vacation, isn't he?
7137038	eng	There's really nothing we can do about that today.
7137039	eng	That's the only reason Tom is winning.
7137040	eng	I was surprised by what I saw last week in Boston.
7137041	eng	Tom seemed to want me to stay.
7137042	eng	I think what we saw was a shark, but I'm not sure.
7137043	eng	That's why Tom is under investigation.
7137044	eng	We always have a lot of fun when we visit Boston.
7137045	eng	Tom is here to help you, isn't he?
7137046	eng	Wait until I tell your father what you did today.
7137047	eng	There's no evidence that Tom did that.
7137048	eng	There's no way to predict what's going to happen.
7137049	eng	Tom shouldn't have known that.
7137050	eng	It almost looked as if that were going to happen.
7137051	eng	There's no question which Tom prefers.
7137052	eng	We need to fix that problem as soon as possible.
7137053	eng	Tom is hiding something, isn't he?
7137054	eng	If I'm going to do that, I've got to do it soon.
7137055	eng	Unfortunately, Tom is already engaged.
7137056	eng	We sold our three-bedroom house on Park Street.
7137057	eng	Tom spends more than he earns.
7137058	eng	That's the reason we're doing what we're doing.
7137059	eng	Unfortunately, Tom is already married.
7137060	eng	It almost looked like that was going to happen.
7137061	eng	Tom is hiding somewhere, isn't he?
7137062	eng	I don't expect tomorrow to be as busy as today.
7137063	eng	Apparently, Tom didn't want to do that.
7137064	eng	We didn't get answers to any of our questions.
7137065	eng	Tom wants to rent a new place.
7137066	eng	This team hasn't lost a game in three seasons.
7137067	eng	Do you still think Tom should be fired?
7137068	eng	Most of the time, I just do what I want to do.
7137069	eng	Tom is in Australia now, isn't he?
7137070	eng	I'm not really sure how this is going to work.
7137071	eng	Evidently Tom got fired for doing that.
7137072	eng	I think that's an option we need to look into.
7137073	eng	Tom answered all the questions.
7137074	eng	I don't really know how this is going to work.
7137075	eng	I could've sworn I saw Tom in the park.
7137076	eng	I did my best to make sure that didn't happen.
7137077	eng	Tom is in a lot of pain, isn't he?
7137078	eng	We've been having a wonderful time in Boston.
7137079	eng	I don't think Tom was paying attention.
7137080	eng	We've always been able to talk to each other.
7137081	eng	Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday.
7137082	eng	Our team hasn't lost a game in three seasons.
7137083	eng	I haven't spoken to Tom in a long time.
7137084	eng	I don't know how to prove I wasn't in Boston.
7137085	eng	Tom is in amazing shape, isn't he?
7137086	eng	I don't expect Monday to be as busy as today.
7137087	eng	I think Tom should be in Boston by now.
7137088	eng	We know you'd rather be in Boston right now.
7137089	eng	Tom doesn't actually hate Mary.
7137090	eng	There's really nothing we can do about that.
7137091	eng	I wonder what Tom is thinking of doing.
7137092	eng	Thank you so much for coming to our wedding.
7137093	eng	Tom is in love with you, isn't he?
7137094	eng	I think that's an option we need to explore.
7137096	eng	I think it's an option we need to look into.
7137097	eng	Tom doesn't actually live here.
7137098	eng	We're still hopeful that's going to happen.
7137099	eng	I've advised Tom to continue dong that.
7137100	eng	We're better prepared than most people are.
7137101	eng	Tom is in the back yard, isn't he?
7137102	eng	We spent the entire day cleaning the house.
7137103	eng	It seems like Tom should've been there.
7137104	eng	They say stress causes high blood pressure.
7137105	eng	It sounds like Tom is hiding something.
7137106	eng	I was at the right place at the right time.
7137107	eng	Tom is in trouble again, isn't he?
7137108	eng	I know you'd rather be in Boston right now.
7137109	eng	It sounds like Tom might be interested.
7137110	eng	I'm not sure Boston is where I want to be.
7137111	eng	Tom has had open-heart surgery.
7137112	eng	I think it's an option we need to explore.
7137113	eng	It was curious that Tom didn't do that.
7137114	eng	We're always looking for ways to improve.
7137115	eng	Tom is itching to leave, isn't he?
7137116	eng	We spent the entire day exploring Boston.
7137117	eng	Maybe Tom will know what we have to do.
7137118	eng	This is what I've wished for all my life.
7137119	eng	Tom has probably been arrested.
7137120	eng	There's no way to predict what'll happen.
7137121	eng	Maybe Tom will know what we need to do.
7137122	eng	Nothing out of the ordinary has happened.
7137123	eng	Tom is just over thirty, isn't he?
7137124	eng	Most accidents are caused by human error.
7137125	eng	Maybe you shouldn't tell Tom the truth.
7137126	eng	I love being able to come back to Boston.
7137127	eng	Tom is being held without bail.
7137128	eng	I can't 100% guarantee that I'll do that.
7137129	eng	Prosecutors still insist Tom is guilty.
7137130	eng	We're going to Boston as soon as we can.
7137131	eng	Tom is just teasing you, isn't he?
7137132	eng	We'll have a chance to do that tomorrow.
7137133	eng	Sometimes I think Tom knows everything.
7137134	eng	We look forward to seeing you in Boston.
7137135	eng	Tom isn't a trustworthy person.
7137136	eng	There's nothing I can do to change that.
7137137	eng	Suddenly, Tom realized what Mary meant.
7137138	eng	That's why we're doing what we're doing.
7137139	eng	Tom is leaving tomorrow, isn't he?
7137140	eng	We need to fix that problem right away.
7137141	eng	Suddenly, Tom realized what Mary wanted.
7137142	eng	They never told me what I needed to do.
7137143	eng	Tom just might have to do that.
7137144	eng	Please don't forget to mention my name.
7137145	eng	That was worst thing Tom could've done.
7137146	eng	It's been a very emotional time for me.
7137147	eng	Tom is likely to be out, isn't he?
7137148	eng	I look forward to seeing you in Boston.
7137149	eng	That was worst thing Tom could've said.
7137150	eng	Each correct answer is worth one point.
7137151	eng	Tom left to go to pick Mary up.
7137152	eng	We need to fix that problem right now.
7137153	eng	That's exactly what Tom wanted changed.
7137154	eng	We felt the earthquake here in Boston.
7137155	eng	Tom is living in Boston, isn't he?
7137156	eng	To tell the truth, I didn't talk much.
7137157	eng	That's why Tom doesn't want to do that.
7137158	eng	This is a personal and private matter.
7137159	eng	Tom may have had an accomplice.
7137160	eng	They had no reason to ask us to leave.
7137161	eng	Was Tom the one who gave you that ring?
7137162	eng	Nothing interesting happens in Boston.
7137163	eng	Tom is looking for help, isn't he?
7137164	eng	I've also lived in Boston and Chicago.
7137165	eng	Tom moved to Australia in 2013.
7137166	eng	I'll be there next Monday to help you.
7137167	eng	Apparently, Tom doesn't do that anymore.
7137168	eng	We're supposed to follow these rules.
7137169	eng	Tom is looking for work, isn't he?
7137170	eng	We're already busy looking into that.
7137171	eng	Apparently, Tom doesn't like doing that.
7137172	eng	We don't expect that to happen again.
7137173	eng	Tom is lucky to be here, isn't he?
7137174	eng	This is a nice way to start the year.
7137175	eng	Apparently, Tom left his wallet at home.
7137176	eng	They were very cheap a few years ago.
7137177	eng	Tom said he had fun doing that.
7137178	eng	There's really nothing more I can do.
7137179	eng	Did anything happen between you and Tom?
7137180	eng	There weren't very many people there.
7137181	eng	Tom is lying about that, isn't he?
7137182	eng	Please tell me exactly what happened.
7137183	eng	If we don't do it, it won't get done.
7137184	eng	Tom seemed to want me to leave.
7137185	eng	This is a very special place for me.
7137186	eng	I'm not sure what Tom does for a living.
7137187	eng	That's why I didn't want to do this.
7137188	eng	Tom is moving back home, isn't he?
7137189	eng	Thank you for coming to our wedding.
7137190	eng	I've advised Tom not to start dong that.
7137191	eng	Tom shouldn't be working today.
7137192	eng	I was living in Boston at that time.
7137193	eng	It's really nice how you look after Tom.
7137194	eng	I think it's time for us to do that.
7137195	eng	Tom is moving to Boston, isn't he?
7137196	eng	We look forward to visiting Boston.
7137197	eng	Maybe Tom didn't do what he said he did.
7137198	eng	We leave for Boston in the morning.
7137199	eng	Tom started humming to himself.
7137200	eng	This is just a temporary situation.
7137201	eng	Maybe Tom should've done something else.
7137202	eng	They're sticking by their decision.
7137203	eng	Tom is next on the list, isn't he?
7137204	eng	I want to talk about what happened.
7137205	eng	Of course, Tom shouldn't have done that.
7137206	eng	I ate bacon and eggs for breakfast.
7137207	eng	Tom started talking about Mary.
7137208	eng	We take the allegations seriously.
7137209	eng	Thank goodness Tom had health insurance.
7137210	eng	We need to fix that problem today?
7137211	eng	Tom is now in Australia, isn't he?
7137212	eng	This is where we're going to stay.
7137213	eng	That's something Tom should do tomorrow.
7137214	eng	There's really nothing you can do.
7137215	eng	Wasn't Tom with you yesterday afternoon?
7137216	eng	I'd rather be in Boston right now.
7137217	eng	Tom is off duty tonight, isn't he?
7137218	eng	I think maybe that's a good thing.
7137219	eng	Apparently, Tom doesn't enjoy doing that.
7137220	eng	What I did obviously didn't help.
7137221	eng	Tom told me to say nothing.
7137222	eng	We're going to Boston next month.
7137223	eng	Eventually, Tom did what he said he'd do.
7137224	eng	Tom is on a strict diet, isn't he?
7137225	eng	Those things are going to happen.
7137226	eng	Tom will give a speech tonight.
7137227	eng	This is just a temporary problem.
7137228	eng	That's exactly what Tom said I should do.
7137229	eng	This is a very important message.
7137230	eng	Tom is on the other bus, isn't he?
7137231	eng	There's really nothing we can do.
7137232	eng	That's something Tom shouldn't try doing.
7137233	eng	That's why I became a journalist.
7137234	eng	Tom will likely be unimpressed.
7137235	eng	That's never been a goal of mine.
7137236	eng	That's the only reason Tom is doing that.
7137237	eng	I'm actually feeling pretty good.
7137238	eng	Tom is on the swim team, isn't he?
7137239	eng	I was living in Boston back then.
7137240	eng	There wasn't anything I could do for Tom.
7137241	eng	I want to become a music teacher.
7137242	eng	Tom wouldn't talk to reporters.
7137243	eng	I ate ham and eggs for breakfast.
7137244	eng	Tom is packing his bags, isn't he?
7137245	eng	How much more support do we need?
7137246	eng	I don't know how to spell Tom's last name.
7137247	eng	Each correct answer is one point.
7137248	eng	Tom and Mary argue all the time.
7137249	eng	We've decided to move to Boston.
7137250	eng	Tom is paid by the hour, isn't he?
7137251	eng	I seems like Tom prefers being by himself.
7137252	eng	They've done an outstanding job.
7137253	eng	Tom couldn't sleep on the plane.
7137254	eng	There's really nothing I can do.
7137255	eng	I wanted to go over a few things with Tom.
7137256	eng	There were a lot of great ideas.
7137257	eng	Tom is planning a party, isn't he?
7137258	eng	That's what really surprised me.
7137259	eng	If Tom doesn't do that, I wonder who will.
7137260	eng	That doesn't look like a school.
7137261	eng	Tom couldn't sleep on the train.
7137262	eng	It's good to see that happening.
7137263	eng	It looks like Tom has missed your cooking.
7137264	eng	It's definitely worth the price.
7137265	eng	Tom is playing outdoors, isn't he?
7137266	eng	I've photographed many children.
7137267	eng	It was fun watching Tom trying to do that.
7137268	eng	I think what we saw was a shark.
7137269	eng	Tom decided not to go with Mary.
7137270	eng	We don't expect that to happen.
7137271	eng	Luckily, Tom only suffered minor injuries.
7137272	eng	This is a serious issue for us.
7137273	eng	Tom is pretty confident, isn't he?
7137274	eng	That's what scared me the most.
7137275	eng	Perhaps Tom could've done that by himself.
7137276	eng	That's definitely not the plan.
7137277	eng	You have the right to do that.
7137278	eng	Sometimes Tom swims laps before breakfast.
7137279	eng	We weren't allowed to do that.
7137280	eng	Tom is pretty irritated, isn't he?
7137281	eng	Today's going to be a big day.
7137282	eng	Suddenly, Tom realized what was happening.
7137283	eng	This is very important for me.
7137284	eng	Tom has never given me anything.
7137285	eng	They never told me what to do.
7137286	eng	The problem is Tom didn't know what to do.
7137287	eng	They haven't contacted us yet.
7137288	eng	Tom is pretty laid back, isn't he?
7137289	eng	That's why we need to protest.
7137290	eng	You knew Tom was lying to you, didn't you?
7137291	eng	That was very, very dangerous.
7137292	eng	Fortunately, Tom earns more than he spends.
7137293	eng	My whole family will be there.
7137294	eng	Tom is pretty mad at me, isn't he?
7137295	eng	It's been a tough year for us.
7137296	eng	Tom is pretty obnoxious, isn't he?
7137297	eng	It was the best vacation ever.
7137298	eng	I suppose Tom made some interesting points.
7137299	eng	I'll definitely remember this.
7137300	eng	How much support will we have?
7137301	eng	Tom is proud of his son, isn't he?
7137302	eng	We might as well do that now.
7137303	eng	I've advised Tom not to continue dong that.
7137304	eng	We decided to move to Boston.
7137305	eng	Tom is getting better every day.
7137306	eng	There were many people there.
7137307	eng	Perhaps Tom should've done that by himself.
7137308	eng	That doesn't to matter to me.
7137309	eng	Tom is psyched about it, isn't he?
7137310	eng	That didn't bother me at all.
7137311	eng	Suddenly, Tom realized what Mary was doing.
7137312	eng	I've never seen one of those.
7137313	eng	Tom is going to be back shortly.
7137314	eng	I think it's time for a beer.
7137315	eng	That doesn't mean Tom will stop doing that.
7137316	eng	How much support do you need?
7137317	eng	Tom is quite a gardener, isn't he?
7137318	eng	How much support do you have?
7137319	eng	There's not much Tom can do about that now.
7137320	eng	We've been very cooperative.
7137321	eng	Tom is going to be coming later.
7137322	eng	We want to fix that problem.
7137323	eng	Tom is quite often late, isn't he?
7137324	eng	We need to get back to work.
7137325	eng	As long as Tom is with you, I'm not worried.
7137326	eng	We need to fix that problem.
7137327	eng	Tom is going to be driving home.
7137328	eng	We may be forced to do that.
7137329	eng	I came to Boston a few weeks before Tom did.
7137330	eng	There's almost no milk left.
7137331	eng	Tom is rather eccentric, isn't he?
7137332	eng	I've never had one of those.
7137333	eng	I can't say that I blame Tom for doing that.
7137334	eng	I had to do that to survive.
7137335	eng	Tom is going to be here shortly.
7137336	eng	We'll look into the matter.
7137337	eng	I seems like Tom prefers working by himself.
7137338	eng	We want to do what's right.
7137339	eng	Tom is really angry now, isn't he?
7137340	eng	We need to keep doing this.
7137341	eng	Isn't there something we can do to help Tom?
7137342	eng	There's not much milk left.
7137343	eng	Tom is going to be off tomorrow.
7137344	eng	It would be better if Tom heard it from you.
7137345	eng	It's been a very long trip.
7137346	eng	It would be better if Tom heard that from you.
7137347	eng	I'm already here in Boston.
7137348	eng	Tom is really different, isn't he?
7137349	eng	What we have is very good.
7137350	eng	It's unclear why Tom had stopped doing that.
7137351	eng	We want to get back there.
