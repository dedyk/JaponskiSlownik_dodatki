6277931	ukr	Том кинув трохи грошей до капелюха вуличного музиканта.
6277932	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що йому потрібно робити.
6277933	ukr	Тому слід сказати Мері, що треба зробити.
6277934	ukr	Том говорив про Мері неправдиві речі.
6277935	ukr	Том сказав, що він починає відчувати запаморочення.
6277936	ukr	Том сказав, що він хоче купити щось попоїсти.
6277937	ukr	Том сказав, що він хоче купити щось поїсти.

6277939	ukr	Том сказав, що хоче зробити пиріг для Мері.
6277940	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно купити щось попоїсти.
6277941	ukr	Тому дійсно треба було дати Мері більше грошей.
6277942	ukr	Том поїхав з Бостона за кілька днів після Різдва.
6277943	ukr	Том знав, що Мері не буде зайнята.
6277944	ukr	Том знав, що ось-ось станеться щось погане.
6277945	ukr	Том обідає на ганку з Мері.
6277946	ukr	Том стрибнув на свій мотоцикл та поїхав.
6277947	ukr	Том не зробив нічого з того, що ми сказали йому зробити.
6277948	ukr	Якщо Том попросить мене допомогти йому, я допоможу.
6277949	ukr	Том не зробив нічого з того, що йому сказали.
6277950	ukr	Боюся, Тому це може не сподобатися.
6277951	ukr	Том і гадки не мав, що поводився нечемно.
6277952	ukr	У Тома було достатньо грошей, щоб купити все, що він хоче.
6277953	ukr	У Тома було достатньо грошей, щоб купити все, що йому потрібно.
6277954	ukr	Том знайшов три золоті монети у своєму дворі.
6277955	ukr	Учора ввечері Том випив три пляшки вина.
6277956	ukr	Том не знав, як вибачитися французькою.
6277957	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері звільнять.
6277958	ukr	Том, очевидно, не сказав Мері, що робити.
6277959	ukr	Том та Мері були, нарешті, геть самі.
6277960	ukr	Я думаю, я переконав Тома допомогти.
6277961	ukr	Я думаю, я переконала Тома допомогти.
6277962	ukr	Том та Мері домовилися зустрітися в коридорі.
6277963	ukr	Том та Мері говорять про свої плани.
6277964	ukr	Том та Мері обговорюють свої плани.
6277965	ukr	Том вже знає, що зробить Мері.
6277966	ukr	Том Джексон вважався чудовим вчителем.
6277967	ukr	Єдине місце, куди Том колись їздив, — це Бостон.
6277968	ukr	Останнього разу я бачив Тома у понеділок вранці.
6277969	ukr	Останнього разу я бачила Тома у понеділок вранці.
6277970	ukr	Хтось, мабуть, розповів Тому, але це був не я.
6277971	ukr	Хтось, мабуть, розповів Тому, але це була не я.
6277972	ukr	Ніхто точно не знає, куди хоче поїхати Том.
6277973	ukr	Ніхто точно не знає, куди хоче піти Том.
6277974	ukr	Я думав, Том їде з тобою до Бостона.
6277975	ukr	Я думала, Том їде з тобою до Бостона.
6277976	ukr	Я думав, що я побачу Тома вчора.
6277977	ukr	Я думала, що я побачу Тома вчора.
6277978	ukr	Я думав, що я чув, що Том буде тут.
6277979	ukr	Я думала, що я чула, що Том буде тут.
6277980	ukr	Я думаю, Том би надав перевагу грі у теніс.
6277981	ukr	Я думаю, Том краще пограв би в теніс.
6277982	ukr	Я думаю, Том та Мері не знають одне одного.
6277983	ukr	Гадаю, Том та Мері не знають одне одного.
6277984	ukr	Я не думаю, що тобі слід йти туди з Томом.
6277985	ukr	Не думаю, що вам слід їхати туди з Томом.
6277986	ukr	Я не знаю нікого з учителів Тома.
6277987	ukr	Думаєш, Том зробив би це таким чином?
6277988	ukr	Думаєте, Том зробив би це таким чином?
6277989	ukr	Думаєш, Том колись сюди повернеться?
6277990	ukr	Думаєте, Том колись сюди повернеться?
6277991	ukr	Том швидко зрозумів, що він не сам.
6277992	ukr	Том знав, що він навряд чи запізниться.
6277993	ukr	Том знав, що його заарештують.
6277994	ukr	Том знав, що у двері стукала Мері.
6277995	ukr	Том сьогодні у чорному пальто.
6277996	ukr	Том сьогодні у чорній куртці.
6277997	ukr	Том прийде з нами жити.
6277998	ukr	Том весь день плаче.
6277999	ukr	Том не дозволив Мері вести його машину.
6278000	ukr	Том стверджує, що він навіть ніколи не говорив з Мері.
6278001	ukr	Том не знав, де працює Мері.
6278002	ukr	Том запитав нас, в яких музеях ми були.
6278003	ukr	Том любить багато чого робити.
6278004	ukr	Том та Мері завжди були разом.
6278005	ukr	Я б хотів знати, чому Том нам не допомагає.
6278006	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, чому Том нам не допомагає.
6278007	ukr	Скажи Тому, що я йду з Мері.
6278008	ukr	Скажіть Тому, що я йду з Мері.
6278009	ukr	Я певен, що Том не брехав би Мері.
6278010	ukr	Я певна, що Том не брехав би Мері.
6278011	ukr	Які книжки любить читати Том?
6278012	ukr	Дуже шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб нам допомогти.
6278013	ukr	Саме Том розповів про це Мері.
6278014	ukr	Я думаю, Тому би це дуже сподобалося.
6278015	ukr	Том хотів знати, хто батько Мері.
6278017	ukr	Том думав, що план Мері не дуже добрий.
6278018	ukr	Я думаю, що знаю, що сказав би Том.
6278019	ukr	Гадаю, що знаю, що сказав би Том.
6278020	ukr	Чому Тому слід це робити, якщо він цього робити не зобов'язаний?
6278021	ukr	Чому Том думає, що зробти це було доброю ідеєю?
6278022	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том ніколи цього не робив?
6278023	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том ніколи цього не робив?
6278024	ukr	Я не вірю тому, що сказав мені Том.
6278025	ukr	Те, що ми з Томом зробили того дня, неможливо пробачити.
6278026	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері не робити цього.
6278027	ukr	Том ніколи не зможе зробити цього один.
6278028	ukr	Том сказав про Мері жахливі речі.
6278029	ukr	Том допоможе тобі це зробити, якщо хочеш.
6278030	ukr	Том допоможе вам це зробити, якщо хочеш.
6278031	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше, коли він буде не такий зайнятий.
6278032	ukr	Це зробив не Том. Це була Мері.
6278033	ukr	Том сказав мені, де він планував це робити.
6278034	ukr	Тому слід сказати Мері, що вона повинна це зробити.
6278035	ukr	Том сказав, що пам'ятає, що попросив Мері це зробити.
6278036	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібний спеціальний інструмент, щоб це зробити.
6278037	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері хоче це зробити.
6278038	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері потрібно це зробити.
6278039	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що я цього не робитиму.
6278040	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері небагато грошей.
6278041	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278042	ukr	Я хотіла сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278043	ukr	Том не дуже добре грає на піаніно.
6278044	ukr	Я думав, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278045	ukr	Я гадала, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278046	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати Мері зробити це.
6278047	ukr	Том ніколи не дізнається, хто це зробив.
6278048	ukr	Том запитає Мері, чи вона може це зробити.
6278049	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж Мері.
6278050	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж я.
6278051	ukr	Том придумав цікавий спосіб, як це зробити.
6278052	ukr	Том, здається, не поспішав цього робити.
6278053	ukr	Том не знав, що він має допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278054	ukr	Том та Мері були перші, хто це зробив.
6278055	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про тебе не розповідав.
6278056	ukr	Том та Мері завжди роблять це разом.
6278057	ukr	Том вже знає, чому Мері хоче це зробити.
6278058	ukr	Якщо ти розповіш Тому, як це зробити, він це зробить.
6278059	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає, як це зробити.
6278060	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає спосіб, як це зробити.
6278061	ukr	Я не певен, чи може це Том зробити, чи ні.
6278062	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том запропонував нам це зробити сьогодні.
6278063	ukr	Цікаво, скільки людей бачило, як Том це робив.
6278064	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не проситиме мене робити це.
6278065	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не проситиме мене зробити це.
6278066	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері полетіла на дельтаплані.
6278067	ukr	Я думав, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278068	ukr	Я гадала, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278069	ukr	Я думаю, що саме Том сказав Мері це зробити.
6278070	ukr	Я думаю, Том, можливо, зможе це зробити для Мері.
6278271	ukr	Я думаю, що Том планує зробити це завтра.
6278272	ukr	Том знав, що він вже не потрібний.
6278273	ukr	Я думаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278274	ukr	Гадаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278275	ukr	Я не мав уяви, що Том буде це робити.
6278276	ukr	Я не мала поняття, що Том буде це робити.
6278277	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том колись припинить це робити.
6278278	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь перестане це робити.
6278279	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це колись робив.
6278280	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь це робив.
6278281	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том міг би переконати Мері це зробити.
6278282	ukr	Не думаю, що Том зміг переконати Мері це зробити.
6278283	ukr	Я не знаю, чи Том хое це робити, чи ні.
6278284	ukr	Я не знав, що Том це робитиме.
6278285	ukr	Я не знала, що Том це робитиме.
6278286	ukr	Хіба ти не питав Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278287	ukr	Хіба ти не запитала Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278288	ukr	Ти б сказав Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278289	ukr	Ти не міг би сказати Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278290	ukr	Навіщо Тому знадобилася би Мері, щоб це для нього зробити?
6278291	ukr	Чому Тому треба просити Мері це для нього зробити?
6278292	ukr	З якого дива Том хотів би це зробити?
6278293	ukr	Чому Том хоче марнувати на це час?
6278294	ukr	Том щойно втік із в'язниці.
6278295	ukr	Чому, на твою думку, Тому робитиме це?
6278296	ukr	Гадаю, Тома сьогодні тут не буде.
6278297	ukr	Тому було насправді необхідно це робити?
6278298	ukr	Том спробує дізнатися, чому Мері це зробила.
6278299	ukr	Том, можливо, зазнає травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278300	ukr	Том, імовірно, придумає, як це зробити.
6278301	ukr	Том ніколи за це не пробачить Мері.
6278302	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, там буде?
6278303	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей анекдот, ніхто не засміявся.
6278304	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей жарт, ніхто не засміявся.
6278305	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Тома там не буде?
6278306	ukr	Чому ви вважаєте, що Тома там не буде?
6278307	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще на столі.
6278308	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще лежать на столі.
6278309	ukr	Том був на вечірці до самого кінця.
6278310	ukr	Том думав, що у Мері доволі непоганий план.
6278311	ukr	Тому слід було сказати мені про це раніше.
6278312	ukr	У Тома не було достатньо сил, щоб зробити це.
6278313	ukr	Тому слід було бути ввічливішим.
6278314	ukr	Тому слід було бути більш чемним.
6278315	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати про це Мері.
6278316	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув розповісти про це Мері.
6278317	ukr	Том щойно розповів мені, що треба було зробити.
6278318	ukr	Том просто розповів мені, що треба зробити.
6278319	ukr	Я думаю, Том цього теж не робитиме.
6278320	ukr	Навряд чи Том буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278321	ukr	Том готується до важливої події.
6278322	ukr	У лівій руці Том тримає ніж.
6278323	ukr	Том вирішив не ставати вчителем.
6278324	ukr	Що у той час робив Том?
6278325	ukr	Том весь час носить з собою зброю.
6278326	ukr	Дуже малоймовірно, що Том це зробить коли-небудь ще раз.
6278327	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язаний цього робити.
6278328	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язана цього робити.
6278329	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це сьогодні.
6278330	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278331	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує зробити Мері.
6278332	ukr	Є багато всього, чого Том не їстиме.
6278333	ukr	Тому насправді слід це робити просто зараз.
6278334	ukr	Том не натякає на те, що це зробила Мері, чи не так?
6278335	ukr	Я певен, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278336	ukr	Я певна, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278337	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278338	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робити.
6278339	ukr	Я думав, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278340	ukr	Я думала, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278341	ukr	Думаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278342	ukr	Гадаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278343	ukr	Том вирішив ніколи більше цього не робити.
6278344	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тома не муситиме сидіти у в'язниці.
6278345	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросив.
6278346	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросила.
6278347	ukr	Том весь ранок провів у ліжку.
6278348	ukr	Том не розумів, що Мері не повинна цього робити.
6278349	ukr	Том не купив усе, що хотів.
6278350	ukr	Ти чув, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278351	ukr	Ти чула, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278352	ukr	Усі подумали, що Том канадієць.
6278353	ukr	Будь ласка, покажи Тому, як це робиться.
6278354	ukr	Будь ласка, покажіть Тому, як це зробити.
6278355	ukr	Я певен, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278356	ukr	Я певна, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278357	ukr	Мені цікаво, чому Том не отримує від цього задоволення.
6278358	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ти його попросиш.
6278359	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ви його попросите.
6278360	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том планував це зробити.
6278361	ukr	Тому хотів би, щоб у нього було більше друзів.
6278362	ukr	Думаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278363	ukr	Гадаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278364	ukr	Том думав, що, можливо, сталося щось погане.
6278365	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це робитиме ще.
6278366	ukr	Думаєш, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278367	ukr	Гадаєте, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278368	ukr	Том увесь час плакав.
6278369	ukr	Том спить зі зброєю під подушкою.
6278370	ukr	Тому слід було б більше допомагати Мері.
6278371	ukr	Шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб це зробити.
6278372	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері зробити це.
6278373	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи спізниться.
6278374	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері недостатньо грошей.
6278375	ukr	Том намагається познайомитися з новими друзями.
6278376	ukr	Тома звільнять, якщо він цього не зробить.
6278377	ukr	Том читає детектив.
6278378	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти йому за це заплатиш.
6278379	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви йому за це заплатите.
6278380	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти його ввічливо попросиш.
6278381	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви його ввічливо попросите.
6278382	ukr	Звичайно ж Том спробує це зробити сьогодні.
6278383	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникам усе, що у нього було.
6278384	ukr	Том сказав, що ніколи не сказав би Мері цього робити.
6278385	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволив цього робити.
6278386	ukr	Том сказав, що з радістю це для тебе зробить.
6278387	ukr	Том зрозумів, що має допомогти Мері це зробити.
6278388	ukr	Том не знав, хто чоловік Мері.
6278389	ukr	Я чекаю, щоб Том пішов.
6278390	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я більше цього не робитиму.
6278391	ukr	Том та Мері разом пішли до тогрівельного центру.
6278392	ukr	Том та Мері колись ігнорували одне одного.
6278393	ukr	Малоймовірно, що Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278394	ukr	Це самий останній лист, написаний Томом.
6278395	ukr	Том єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6278396	ukr	Том все ще не дуже добре вміє це робити.
6278397	ukr	Саме це врешті-решт зробив Том.
6278398	ukr	Том не зміг би цього зробити без допомоги.
6278399	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не купуватиме цієї машини.
6278400	ukr	Це я переконав Тома зробити це.
6278401	ukr	Це я переконала Тома зробити це.
6278402	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278403	ukr	Я певна, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278404	ukr	Том чув якісь дивні звуки.
6278405	ukr	Том почув якісь дивні звуки.
6278406	ukr	Я попрошу Тома показати Мері, як це зробити.
6278407	ukr	Я попрошу Тома переконатися в тому, що Мері це робитиме.
6278408	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том планував це зробити.
6278409	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том хотів, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278410	ukr	Том дав Мері ще трохи грошей.
6278411	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278412	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278413	ukr	Я сподіваюся, що Том зробив те, про що ми його попросили.
6278414	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що тобі не сподобається це робити.
6278415	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що вам не сподобається це робити.
6278416	ukr	Я думав, що Том, ймовірно, це зробить.
6278417	ukr	Я все ще відповідаю за Тома.
6278418	ukr	Я думаю, саме тому Том і хотів це зробити.
6278419	ukr	Думаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278420	ukr	Гадаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278421	ukr	З ким Том планував поїхати до Бостона?
6278422	ukr	Думаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278423	ukr	Гадаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278424	ukr	Том говорив по телефону.
6278425	ukr	Том балакав по телефону.
6278426	ukr	Я не думаю, що Тому сподобалося би це робити.
6278427	ukr	Тому було лячно йти на вулицю.
6278428	ukr	Тому було лячно йти надвір.
6278429	ukr	Думаєш, Том це коли-небудь буде робити знову?
6278430	ukr	Том зробить все, що необхідно зробити.
6278431	ukr	Ніхто не заперечує, якщо Том це зробить?
6278432	ukr	Том спробував закінчити те, що він робив.
6278433	ukr	Том намагався закінчити те, що він робив.
6278434	ukr	Чому ми з Томом не робимо цього зараз?
6278435	ukr	Коли Том показав тобі, як це робиться?
6278436	ukr	Коли Том показав вам, як це робиться?
6278437	ukr	Що б ти не робив, не роби цього з Томом.
6278438	ukr	Що б ти не робила, не роби цього з Томом.
6278439	ukr	Том сказав Мері жахливі речі.
6278440	ukr	Том сказав, що він починає втомлюватися.
6278441	ukr	Том вдягнений відповідно до ситуації.
6278442	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері його поцілує.
6278443	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може завдати йому біль.
6278444	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може зробити йому боляче.
6278445	ukr	У Тома були проблеми в школі.
6278446	ukr	Тому буде потрібно зробити це в якомусь іншому місці.
6278447	ukr	Том знав, що Мере не з Бостона.
6278448	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи відмовиться.
6278449	ukr	Том однозначно цього більше не робитиме.
6278450	ukr	Том хотів зупинити Мері від того, щоб вона це зробила.
6278451	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що вона має це зробити.
6278452	ukr	Том наймолодший з трьох братів.
6278453	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що мона може це зробити.
6278454	ukr	Том наполегливо радив не робити цього.
6278455	ukr	Том сказав, що він все ще не готовий це робити.
6278456	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потбрібно допомоги Мері зробити це.
6278457	ukr	Том знає, що він цього аж ніяк не може зробити.
6278458	ukr	Том уяви не мав, що відбувалося.
6278459	ukr	Том знайшов няню для своїх дітей.
6278460	ukr	У Тома не було у Бостоні жодних друзів.
6278461	ukr	Том намагається не чхнути.
6278462	ukr	Том не вірив нічому, що говорила Мері.
6278463	ukr	Том не повірив ні у що, що розповіла Мері.
6278464	ukr	Том побачить, чи Мері зможе це зробити.
6278465	ukr	Том не зміг відчинити двері шафи.
6278466	ukr	Це не дуже добра ідея дозволити Тому зробити це.
6278467	ukr	У Тома завжди з собою його губна гармоніка.
6278468	ukr	Я повинен зараз допомагати Тому.
6278469	ukr	Я повинна зараз допомагати Тому.
6278470	ukr	Я б хотів знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278471	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278472	ukr	Том не це планує зробити.
6278473	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що ти не захочеш цього робити.
6278474	ukr	Я сказала Тому, що ви не захочете цього робити.
6278475	ukr	Я думав, що побачу тут Тома.
6278476	ukr	Я думала, що побачу тут Тома.
6278477	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278478	ukr	Я думала, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278479	ukr	У Тома все ще є що робити.
6278480	ukr	Я думаю, Том робив це одного разу чи двічі.
6278481	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том матимеме щось проти того, щоб це зробити.
6278482	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш знати, як Том це зробив?
6278483	ukr	Хіба ви не хочете знати, як Том це зробив?
6278484	ukr	Ти коли-небудь запитував Тома, як він це зробив?
6278485	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом приблизно не одного віку?
6278486	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом не ровесники?
6278487	ukr	Думаєш, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278488	ukr	Думаєте, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278489	ukr	Том і насправді зробив це без будь-якої допомоги?
6278490	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278491	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278492	ukr	Будинок Тома був дуже гарний.
6278493	ukr	Том був переляканий, і я також.
6278494	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що треба зробити.
6278495	ukr	Том розповів Мері про те, що він зробив.
6278496	ukr	Том зможе це зробити один.
6278497	ukr	Це Том сказав мені це зробити.
6278498	ukr	Тому насправді варто було поснідати.
6278499	ukr	Том зрозумів, що був лише один вихід.
6278500	ukr	Том зрозумів, що він більше не потрібен.
6278501	ukr	Том лише учора ввечері зробив Мері пропозицію.
6278502	ukr	Том повинен був сказати Мері не робити цього.
6278503	ukr	Том грав у комп'ютерні ігри весь день.
6278504	ukr	Том каже, що хоче допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278505	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про вас не розповідав.
6278506	ukr	Том каже, що ще не готовий цього робити.
6278507	ukr	Том знав більше, ніж казав.
6278508	ukr	Том сказав, що йому краще це зробити наступного тижня.
6278509	ukr	Том сказав, що він би хотів, щоб це зробила Мері.
6278510	ukr	Том сказав, що більше ніколи цього не робитиме.
6278511	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде голодна.
6278512	ukr	Том сказав, що немає поспіху у тому, що він робить.
6278513	ukr	Том щойно зателефонував мені кілька хвилин тому.
6278514	ukr	Том не прийде жити з нами.
6278515	ukr	Том сказав, що не може втриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6278516	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат.
6278517	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат-латук.
6278518	ukr	Том купив те, що хотів.
6278519	ukr	Том, імовірно, буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278520	ukr	Том завжди робить все, що може.
6278521	ukr	Том у своїй кімнаті, переодягається.
6278522	ukr	Кого хотів найняти Том?
6278523	ukr	Тому сподобається в Бостоні.
6278734	eng	Tom knew that Mary was likely to not be busy.
6278824	ukr	Том весь вечір дивиться телевізор.
6278825	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно зробити.
6278826	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно робити.
6278827	ukr	Том зараз, мабуть, зайнятий.
6278828	ukr	Том однозначно наляканий.
6278829	ukr	Немає сумніву, що Том переляканий.
6278830	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали зробити.
6278831	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали.
6278832	ukr	Я уяви не мав, що Том це робитиме.
6278833	ukr	Я уяви не мала, що Том це робитиме.
6278834	ukr	Том запевнив мене, що пістолет незаряджений.
6278835	ukr	Яким чином ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278836	ukr	Як ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278837	ukr	Том вийшов з води.
6278838	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб Том це для тебе зробив?
6278839	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб це для тебе зробив Том?
6278840	ukr	Том погодився зустріти Мері після школи.
6278841	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно допомогти Тому.
6278842	ukr	Я думав, що Мері сподобається Тому.
6278843	ukr	Я думаю, тобі слід піти туди з Томом.
6278844	ukr	Я думаю, вам слід піти туди з Томом.
6278845	ukr	Я думаю, що Том минулого тижня їздив до Бостона.
6278846	ukr	Я думаю, Том казав неправду.
6278847	ukr	Я думаю, Том сказав нам неправду.
6278848	ukr	Тому не дозволять це знову зробити.
6278849	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше сьогодні вдень.
6278850	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо Мері захоче, щоб він це зробив.
6278851	ukr	Том знову здоровий.
6278852	ukr	Том намагався це зробити, але не зміг.
6278853	ukr	Том чмокнув Мері й сів у автобус.
6278854	ukr	Том не пам'ятає нічого з тієї ночі.
6278855	ukr	Том сказав, що він би краще цього тут не робив.
6278856	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері варить спагеті.
6278857	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері робить спагеті.
6278858	ukr	Мікроавтобус Тома припаркований біля будинку.
6278859	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж зробить це.
6278860	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж робитиме це.
6278861	ukr	Том чув, як Мері кричала.
6278862	ukr	У Тома недостатньо грошей, щоб купити квиток.
6278863	ukr	Том сказав, що він не бажає цього робити.

6278867	ukr	Том не усвідомлював, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278868	ukr	Том може зазнати травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278869	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня.

6278871	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері сиділа.
6278872	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері ніколи не була в Бостоні.
6278873	ukr	Том завжди має при собі губну гармоніку.
6278874	ukr	Том був на балконі.
6278875	ukr	Том та Мері того ранку грали у теніс.
6278876	ukr	Том та Мері хотіли провести весь день разом.
6278877	ukr	Том та Мері колись все робили разом.
6278878	ukr	Тому має це зробити сам.
6278879	ukr	Том та Мері балакали до 2:30 ночі.

6278883	ukr	Том уже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278884	ukr	Том завжди йде спати до полуночі.
6278885	ukr	У поліції більше немає улік проти Тома.
6278886	ukr	У поліції немає жодних інших улік проти Тома.
6278887	ukr	Єдине ліжко, у якому Том коли-небудь спав, — це його власне.
6278888	ukr	Ніхто точно не знає, куди піде Том.
6278889	ukr	Учора ввечері Том заснув раніше опівночі.
6278890	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти цього робити.
6278891	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти це зробити.
6278892	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче піти з нами риболовити.
6278893	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з тобою, ніж з Томом.
6278894	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з вами, ніж з Томом.
6278895	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів, щоб його кохали.
6278896	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів кохання.
6278897	ukr	Я думаю, Том може переконати Мері зробити це.
6278898	ukr	Цікаво, що надихнуло Тома написати цю пісню?
6278899	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278900	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278901	ukr	Том чув, як Мері хропіла.
6278902	ukr	Том чув хропіння Мері.
6278903	ukr	Я думав, що Том скаже мені, що робити.

6278905	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросив.
6278906	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросила.

6278914	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278915	ukr	Том усвідомив, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278916	ukr	Чому том не хоче, щоб Мері це зробила?

6278918	ukr	Том зняв пальто.
6278919	ukr	Том зняв куртку.
6278920	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том може це зробити?

6278922	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що ми його попросили.

6278939	ukr	Я думав, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278940	ukr	Я думала, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278941	ukr	Том сказав мені, що мені не слід цього робити.
6278942	ukr	Я думав, що Том дасть Мері квіти.
6278943	ukr	Я думав, що Том подарує Мері квіти.
6278944	ukr	Том зробить це знову.
6278945	ukr	Можеш зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278946	ukr	Можети зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278947	ukr	Спочатку Том думав, що Мері — сестра Джона.
6278948	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ти живеш.
6278949	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ви живете.
6278950	ukr	Том боявся йти до печери один.
6278951	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй це сказав.
6278952	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй про це розповів.
6278953	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволить Мері зробити це.
6278954	ukr	Тома заарештували, коли він перетинав кордон.
6278955	ukr	Том хотів, щоб Мері познайомилася з деякими з його друзів.
6278956	ukr	Том розповів Мері все, що вона хотіла знати.
6278957	ukr	Том гадав, що придумав добрий план.
6278958	ukr	Тому слід було подарувати Мері подарунок на день народження.

6278965	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це був не я.
6278966	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це була не я.
6278967	ukr	Том тепер знає правду про те, як померла Мері.

6278984	ukr	Том лише готується це зробити.
6278985	ukr	У Тома серйозні психологічні проблеми.

6278991	ukr	Том весь рано грає на гітарі.
6278992	ukr	Тома не було у ліжку.
6278993	ukr	Том допомагає Мері зробити домашню роботу.
6278994	ukr	Том гадки не мав, що він занадто пронозливий.
6278995	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як і Мері.
6278996	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як Мері.
6278997	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він мав зробити.
6278998	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він повинен зробити.
6278999	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникав усе, що вони хотіли.

6279005	ukr	Вони належать Тому.
6279006	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб його бачили з Мері.
6279007	ukr	Все, що хотів Том, — трохи вільного часу.
6279008	ukr	Том ще не знав, що робитиме.

6279010	ukr	У Тома було набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279011	ukr	У Тома набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279012	ukr	Том одягнув окуляри.
6279013	ukr	Дмаю, Том зробить це знову.
6279014	ukr	Коли Том приїхав, поліція була вже на місці.
6279015	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том зробив це правильно.
6279016	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону зробити це.
6279017	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону це зробити.
6279018	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279019	ukr	Том та Мері не могли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279020	ukr	Я туди не піду.
6279021	ukr	Том не злитиметься, якщо Мері це зробить.
6279022	ukr	Том не планує насправді цього робити, чи не так?
6279023	ukr	Том же не планує насправді цього робити?
6279024	ukr	Я тут не лишуся.
6279025	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, буде готувати йому вечерю?
6279026	ukr	Том не єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6279027	ukr	Гадаєш, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279028	ukr	Ви думаєте, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279029	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я ніколи більше цього не робитиму.
6279030	ukr	Кого ти відвідав?
6279031	ukr	У кого ти був?
6279032	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже не потрібно це робити.
6279033	ukr	Гадаю, мені не варто було говорити Тому про це.
6279034	ukr	Чому ти голий?
6279035	ukr	Чому ти гола?
6279036	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це один.
6279037	ukr	Думаю, Том набагато краще від тебе плаває.
6279038	ukr	Гадаю, Том набагато краще від вас плаває.
6279039	ukr	Том каже, що зробить це, якщо цього захоче Мері.
6279040	ukr	Я думав, ще може бути зарано, щоб зайти до Тома.
6279041	ukr	Я живу у гуртожитку.
6279042	ukr	Том думає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не зробить.
6279043	ukr	Том гадає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не робитиме.
6279044	ukr	Я думав, що Ти знаєш, що Том та Мері одружені.
6279045	ukr	Том спробував зробити це, але не зміг.
6279046	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене йому допомагати.
6279047	ukr	Том зробить це першим ділом вранці.
6279048	ukr	Мері була першою дівчиною, яку Том коли-небудь кохав.
6279049	ukr	Том зробить це для тебе, якщо захочеш.
6279050	ukr	Том зробить це для вас, якщо захочете.
6279051	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуй умовити Тома приєднатися до нашої команди.
6279052	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуйте умовити Тома вступити до нашої команди.
6279053	ukr	Я зробив тобі чаю.
6279054	ukr	Я зробила вам чаю.
6279055	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ви цього не зробите сьогодні.
6279056	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ти цього не зробиш сьогодні.
6279057	ukr	Том та Мері сперечаються весь день.
6279058	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том це коли-небудь робитиме?
6279059	ukr	Я сьогодні багато працював.
6279060	ukr	Том та Мері говорили про всяке-різне.
6279061	ukr	Чому Том зробив це — поза моїм розумінням.
6279062	ukr	Том та Мері колись співали разом у клубі.
6279063	ukr	Чому Тому потрібна Мері, щоб зробити це для нього?
6279064	ukr	Том спалив усі листи, які надіслала йому Мері.
6279065	ukr	Я маю йти додому.
6279066	ukr	Мушу вже йти додому.
6279067	ukr	Чому б Том робив це, якщо він не має цього робити?
6279068	ukr	Ти не міг би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279069	ukr	Ви не могли би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279070	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері гадає, що йому треба піти.
6279071	ukr	Ти б знав, якби Тому можна було це зробити?
6279072	ukr	Ти б знала, якби Тому можна було це робити?
6279073	ukr	Ми балакали годинами.
6279074	ukr	Ми говорили годинами.
6279075	ukr	Думаєш, Том не заперечував би проти того, щоб Мері це зробила?
6279076	ukr	Том забув купити те, про що його попросила Мері.
6279077	ukr	Ти мене пробачиш?
6279078	ukr	Ви мене пробачите?
6279079	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том коли-небудь почне це робити.
6279080	ukr	Том не повернеться, щоб забрати Мері.
6279081	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ти це зробив.
6279082	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ви це зробили.
6279083	ukr	Сподіваюся, ми не програємо.
6279084	ukr	Том знав, що не дуже подобається Мері.
6279085	ukr	Думаю, Том, можливо, не зможе цього сьогодні зробити.
6279086	ukr	Том знав, що Мері не хоче пити пиво.
6279087	ukr	Том знав, що Мері, скоріш за все, не зайнята.
6279088	ukr	Я зробив добрий вибір.
6279089	ukr	Я зробила добрий вибір.
6279090	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не скаже мені це робити.
6279091	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що потрібно зробити.
6279092	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що треба зробити.
6279093	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том показав Мері, як це робиться?
6279094	ukr	Том запросив Мері у найдорожчий ресторан у місті.
6279095	ukr	Тобі не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279096	ukr	Вам не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279097	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені потрібно це зробити.
6279098	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де живе Мері.
6279099	ukr	У тебе гарний дім.
6279100	ukr	У тебе гарна оселя.
6279101	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені не треба цього робити.
6279102	ukr	Том не зміг зробити того, про що ми його попросили.
6279103	ukr	Я не певен, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279104	ukr	Я не певна, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279105	ukr	Том був дуже знервований, коли це відбувалося.
6279106	ukr	Мене не дивує, що Том хотів це зробити.
6279107	ukr	Мене не дивує, що Том хотів цим зайнятися.
6279108	ukr	У мене було погане відчуття щодо цього.
6279109	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері пішли на пляж.
6279110	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері ходили на пляж.
6279111	ukr	Я певен, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279112	ukr	Я певна, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279113	ukr	Шкода, що Тома немає тут, щоб показати нам, що робити.
6279114	ukr	Том сказав, що він хоче бути там о котрій годині?
6279115	ukr	Тост виглядає так, ніби згорів.
6279116	ukr	Грінка виглядає ніби згоріла.
6279117	ukr	Можливо, тобі не варто це більше робити з Томом.
6279118	ukr	Коли я розповів про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279119	ukr	Коли я розповіла про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279120	ukr	Том та Мері завжди робили це разом.
6279122	ukr	Де ваша парасолька?
6279123	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, позичить йому парасольку?
6279124	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб хто-небудь бачив, як він це робить.
6279125	ukr	Хто дозволив Тому взяти мій велосипед?
6279126	ukr	Том робить це так, як його навчила Мері.
6279127	ukr	Я не розумів, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279128	ukr	Я не усвідомлювала, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279129	ukr	У тебе гарний будинок.
6279130	ukr	У вас гарний будинок.
6279131	ukr	Том чув, що Мері сказала, що не може цього зробити.
6279132	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том бажав би нам допомогти.
6279133	ukr	Том проінформував Мері, що вона не має цього робити.
6279134	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купив.
6279135	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купила.
6279136	ukr	Том спробує знайти спосіб, як це зробити.
6279137	ukr	Думаю, тобі треба написати Тому лист-подяку.
6279138	ukr	Том знав, що Мері більше не мусить робити цього.
6279139	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279140	ukr	Я думала, що ви знаєте, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279141	ukr	Том взяв три книжки в бібліотеці.
6279142	ukr	Том чув, як Мері та Джон розмовляли про Еліс.
6279143	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс полюбляють танцювати.
6279144	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс люблять танці.
6279145	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс — канадійці.
6279146	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс живуть у Бостоні.
6279147	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс прийшли сюди разом.
6279148	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс приїхали сюди разом.
6279149	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс з Бостона.
6279150	ukr	Том та Джон одружені на сестрах.
6279151	ukr	Том сидить між Мері та Джоном.
6279152	ukr	Я думаю, Том попросить Мері зробити це для Джона.
6279153	ukr	Том не хоче, щоб Мері казала Джону будь-що.
6279154	ukr	Хто сказав Тому попросити Мері допомогти Джону зробити це?
6279155	ukr	Тобі слід зробити те, що ти можеш.
6279156	ukr	Вам слід зробити те, що ви можете.
6279157	ukr	Мені подобається гаряча кава.
6279158	ukr	Я люблю гарячу каву.
6279159	ukr	Це нелегко зробити.
6279160	ukr	Це було нелегко зробити.
6279161	ukr	Це було не дуже важко зробити.
6279162	ukr	Переконати Тома не робити цього було неважко.
6279163	ukr	Переконати Тома не робити цього було нескладно.
6279164	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було неважко це зробити.
6279165	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було нескладно це зробити.
6279166	ukr	Тома несправедливо звинуватили у злочині.
6279170	ukr	Туман розсіюється.
6279171	ukr	Тобі дійсно потрібно це зробити зараз.
6279172	ukr	Тобі дійсно зараз треба це зробити.
6279173	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно стільців.
6279174	ukr	Стільці більше не потрібні.
6279175	ukr	Якщо хочеш зробити це, зроби це.
6279176	ukr	Якщо хочете зробити це, зробіть це.
6279177	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно знову це зробити.
6279178	ukr	Вам буде потрібно зробити це знову.
6279179	ukr	Тобі слід це робити зараз.
6279180	ukr	Ти зараз повинен це робити.
6279181	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно грошей.
6279182	ukr	Я дійсно мав це зробити.
6279183	ukr	Я дійсно мала це зробити.
6279184	ukr	Тобі слід дотримуватися тут тиші.
6279185	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це швидко.
6279186	ukr	Вам слід зробити це швидко.
6279187	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно часу.
6279188	ukr	Це не мало багато сенсу.
6279189	ukr	Мені дійсно слід це зараз зробити.
6279190	ukr	Я знав, що ти цього не робитимеш.
6279191	ukr	Я знала, що ви цього не робитимете.
6279192	ukr	Я мав право це сказати.
6279193	ukr	Я мала право це сказати.
6279194	ukr	Том та Мері чекають на друг дитину.
6279195	ukr	Копати — важка праця.
6279196	ukr	Том хоче піти стопами свого батька.
6279200	ukr	Ти маєш це зробити.
6279201	ukr	Тобі слід бути в своїй кімнаті.
6279202	ukr	Вам слід бути в своїй кімнаті.
6279203	ukr	Будь ласка, ніколи не лишай мене.
6279205	ukr	Я придумаю, як це зробити.
6279207	ukr	Я мала право це зробити.
6279208	ukr	Мені снилося, як я це робив.
6279209	ukr	Мені снилося, як я це робила.
6279210	ukr	Я не хочу більше котів.
6279211	ukr	Тобі дійсно слід це зробити.
6279212	ukr	Вам дійсно слід це зробити.
6279213	ukr	Тобі слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279214	ukr	Вам слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279511	ukr	Я боявся, що загублю тебе.
6279512	ukr	Я боялася, що загублю вас.
6279513	ukr	Мені слід зараз бути в Бостоні.
6279514	ukr	Мені дійсно зараз треба бути у ліжку.
6279516	ukr	Не пийте забагато вина.
6279518	ukr	Будь ласка, не будь такою галасливою.
6279523	ukr	Ці діти ваші?
6279524	ukr	Тобі слід було це зробити.
6279525	ukr	Вам слід було це зробити.
6279526	ukr	Мені насправді потрібно це зробити.
6279527	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже втомленим.
6279528	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже втомленою.
6279529	ukr	Ці олівці твої?
6279530	ukr	Ці олівці ваші?
6279531	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це зараз.
6279532	ukr	Вам слід зробити це зараз.
6279533	ukr	Це не дуже допомогло.
6279534	ukr	Мені слід зробити це зараз.
6279535	ukr	Ці собаки твої?
6279536	ukr	Ці собаки ваші?
6279537	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це.
6279538	ukr	Вам слід зробити це.
6279539	ukr	Віддай мені усе.
6279540	ukr	Віддайте мені усу.
6279541	ukr	Цей собака ваш?
6279542	ukr	Цей собака твій?
6279543	ukr	Мені слід зробити це.
6279544	ukr	Хто нас врятує?
6279546	ukr	Дивись уважно, як я це роблю.
6279547	ukr	Спостерігайте уважно, як я це роблю.
6279548	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для тебе зробити.
6279549	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для вас зробити.
6279550	ukr	Ці яблука не були занадто дорогі.
6279551	ukr	Я думаю, ти теж можеш це зробити.
6279552	ukr	Я думаю, ви теж можете це зробити.
6279553	ukr	Учора Мері загубила свою сумочку.
6279554	ukr	Пропоную тобі зробити це зараз.
6279555	ukr	Пропоную вам зробити це зараз.
6279556	ukr	Давай заспіваєймо щось разом.
6279557	ukr	Заспіваймо щось разом.
6279558	ukr	Я все ще не отримаю задоволення від того, що роблю це.
6279559	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з тобою.
6279560	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з вами.
6279561	ukr	Я пішов з Мері на танці.
6279562	ukr	Ми з Мері пішли на танці.
6279563	ukr	Ти колись намагався це робити?
6279564	ukr	Ви колись намагалися це робити?
6279565	ukr	Ніхто не викликався добровольцем, щоб зробити це.
6279566	ukr	Я вирішив знову це зробити.
6279567	ukr	Я вирішила зробити це знову.
6279568	ukr	Ми не звиклі до такого гамору.
6279569	ukr	Я однозначно зроблю це сьогодні.
6279570	ukr	Ми готуємося піти.
6279571	ukr	Я би на твоєму місці зробив це.
6279572	ukr	Я би на вашому місці зробив це.
6279573	ukr	Покажи мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279574	ukr	Покажіть мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279575	ukr	Я все ще не хочу цього робити.
6279576	ukr	Мені подобається колір твоєї машини.
6279577	ukr	Мені подобається колір вашої машини.
6279578	ukr	Мені все ще не подобається це робити.
6279579	ukr	Сподіваюся, екзамен буде легкий.
6279580	ukr	Я купив нову пару взуття.
6279581	ukr	Я купив нове взуття.
6279582	ukr	Я не хочу сьогодні це робити.
6279583	ukr	Мені здається, тобі треба піти.
6279584	ukr	Мені здається, вам треба піти.
6279585	ukr	Ти прочитав усю книжку?
6279586	ukr	Ти прочитала усю книжку?
6279587	ukr	Ти все ще можеш це зробити?
6279588	ukr	Ви все ще можете це зробити?
6279589	ukr	Хіба не ти тут головний?
6279590	ukr	Хіба не ви тут головна?
6279591	ukr	Де тобі потрібно це зробити?
6279592	ukr	Де вам потрібно це зробити?
6279593	ukr	Де ти маєш це зробити?
6279594	ukr	Де ви маєте це зробити?
6279595	ukr	Ці яблука були дорогі.
6279596	ukr	Ми не звиклі до того, щоб це робити.
6279597	ukr	Думаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279598	ukr	Гадаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279599	ukr	Ніхто не допоміг би мені це зробити.
6279600	ukr	Мені насправді сподобалося тут бути.
6279601	ukr	Я закікавлений у тому, щоб це зробити.
6279602	ukr	Сподіваюся, я здам екзамен.
6279603	ukr	Я готуюся зробити це.
6279604	ukr	Шкода, що я більше не можу робити цього.
6279605	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш зробити паузу?
6279606	ukr	Я не поспішав це зробити.
6279607	ukr	Хто для нас готуватиме?
6279608	ukr	Думаю, нам не слід цього робити.
6279609	ukr	Я все ще шкодую, що не можу цього зробити.
6279610	ukr	Давай зіграємо партію у шахи.
6279611	ukr	Я колись мріяв про те, щоб зробити це.
6279612	ukr	Я колись мріяла про те, щоб зробити це.
6279613	ukr	Вже світлішає.
6279614	ukr	Я не знаю, хто може це зробити.
6279615	ukr	Я не міг утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279616	ukr	Я не могла утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279617	ukr	Я отримав багато задоволення від фільму.
6279618	ukr	Я отримала багато задоволення від фільму.
6279619	ukr	Я не думаю, що нам це потрібно.
6279620	ukr	Де нам потрібно це зробити?
6279621	ukr	Я тобі щось купив.
6279622	ukr	Я вам щось купила.
6279623	ukr	Де ми маємо це зробити?
6279624	ukr	Все ці олівці мої.
6279625	ukr	Коли нам потрібно це зробити?
6279626	ukr	Коли ти маєш це зробити?
6279627	ukr	Коли ви маєте це зробити?
6279628	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ти це зробив.
6279629	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ви це зробили.
6279630	ukr	Мері хотіла бути медсестрою.
6279631	ukr	Я б хотів, щоб я також це міг зробити.
6279632	ukr	Я б хотіла, щоб я також це могла зробити.
6279633	ukr	Вже темнішає.
6279634	ukr	Думаю, я це раз зробив.
6279635	ukr	Гадаю, я одного разу це зробила.
6279636	ukr	Я отримую багато задоволення, коли це роблю.
6279637	ukr	Всі відмовилися робити це.
6279638	ukr	Мені дуже сподобалося бути тут.
6279639	ukr	З ким нам слід це зробити?
6279640	ukr	Скільки заробляють учителі?
6279641	ukr	Скільки заробляють викладачі?

6287099	eng	Let's begin with capitalism, a word that has gone largely out of fashion. The approved reference now is to the market system. This shift minimizes — indeed, deletes — the role of wealth in the economic and social system. And it sheds the adverse connotation going back to Marx. Instead of the owners of capital or their attendants in control, we have the admirably impersonal role of market forces. It would be hard to think of a change in terminology more in the interest of those to whom money accords power.

6287109	eng	Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.

6293922	eng	Pluto can reach temperatures of minus 223 degrees Celsius.
6293923	eng	Rain waters our plants and keeps our grass green.
6293924	eng	Some parts of the world, such as the Sahara Desert in Africa, receive very little rain. Others, such as India during the late summer monsoon season, can be subject to widespread flooding.
6293925	eng	Some of our solar-system neighbors have rain, too, but it is not made up of water, as it is on Earth.
6293926	eng	Venus has continuous showers of sulfuric acid rain. However, the acid rain evaporates before it reaches Venus's surface because of the planet's super-hot temperatures.
6293927	eng	That sounds like the perfect place for a vacation.
6293928	rus	Что создал Бог на шестой день?
6293929	eng	Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has rain that is made up of frigid liquid methane, hitting a bitterly cold surface, where the temperature is minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit.
6293930	eng	Titan, Saturn's largest moon, has rain that is made up of frigid liquid methane, hitting a bitterly cold surface, where the temperature is minus 179 degrees Celsius.
6293931	rus	Когда Том говорит, все слушают.
6293932	eng	Powerful winds on Earth can uproot trees, toss over cars, and destroy houses.
6293933	eng	Every single day, 200-mile-per-hour winds whip around Jupiter.
6293934	eng	Storms on Jupiter have been clocked at over 400 miles per hour.
6293935	eng	Clouds on Saturn can reach speeds of 1,100 miles an hour.
6293936	eng	Strong winds can kick up dust storms in dry regions, such as the Sahara Desert.
6293937	eng	Large dust storms have swept through the Sahara Desert in North Africa, turning day into night and making it hard to breathe and see.
6293938	eng	Dust shrouded Mars for three months before fading away.
6293940	eng	In 2005, a massive 400-mile-wide hurricane named Katrina struck New Orleans, La., and neighboring states.
6293941	rus	Это всё демагогия.
6293942	eng	The storm packed winds of 100 to 140 miles per hour, toppling homes and causing widespread flooding.
6293943	eng	Katrina, however, cannot compare to a colossal hurricane on Saturn.
6293944	rus	Худший враг и лучший друг человека - другой человек.
6293945	eng	The Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has been raging for hundreds of years.
6293946	rus	Представьте себя на моём месте.
6293947	eng	Earth has plenty of mountain ranges. The Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains in the U.S. are just two of them.
6293948	eng	The highest mountain in the world is Mt. Everest in Nepal, rising more than 29,000 feet into the sky.
6293949	eng	The highest mountain in the world is Mt. Everest in Nepal, rising more than 8,800 metres into the sky.
6293950	eng	The moon has mountains, too.
6293951	eng	The Moon's Mons Hadley Delta is 15,000 feet tall, and makes up part of the rim of a deep crater from an asteroid impact billions of years ago.
6293952	eng	The volcanic mountains on Mars rise up to five times higher than Mt. Everest.
6293953	rus	Я отремонтировал свой компьютер.
6293954	eng	Pluto, located on the outskirts of our solar system, has a different kind of mountain range, made up of ice. The ice mountains are about 11,000 feet tall. The New Horizons spacecraft spotted them for the first time when it flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015.
6293955	eng	Scientists are still making new discoveries in our solar system.
6293956	eng	The Grand Canyon, located in the northwest corner of Arizona, was carved out millions of years ago by water.
6293957	eng	The Grand Canyon is one mile deep and about 100 miles long.
6293958	eng	The deepest canyon in the world is the Tsangpo Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. The canyon is almost 3.5 miles deep and is slightly longer than the Grand Canyon.
6293959	eng	The Valles Marineris canyon on Mars is even deeper and much longer than Tsangpo Canyon, measuring 10 miles deep and stretching about 3,000 miles across, which is about the width of the continental U.S.
6293960	eng	History has recorded many violent volcanic eruptions on Earth.
6293961	eng	In 1991, Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic outburst in the Philippines produced the second largest eruption of the 20th century. Ash from the blast was ejected as high as 21 miles above Earth. Particles from the eruption created a layer of sulfuric acid haze in Earth's atmosphere, dropping global temperatures by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit between 1991 and 1993.
6293962	eng	Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
6293963	eng	Olympus Mons, an inactive volcano on Mars, spreads over an area as large as the state of Arizona.
6293964	rus	Ну не плачь.
6293965	rus	Ну не плачьте.
6293966	eng	Jupiter's moon, Io, has more than 400 active volcanoes, making it the most geologically active object in the solar system. Several volcanoes on Io produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that rise as high as 300 miles above its surface.
6293967	eng	Rivers are plentiful on Earth, and each river has a connection of streams that all flow into it. Some of Earth's solar-system neighbors show evidence that they once had similar river systems.
6293968	eng	Observations of Mars, Venus, and Titan reveal a series of thin channels that lead to larger channels. Although now dry, these channels could have once been river systems.
6293969	eng	Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.
6293970	eng	Earth's polar ice caps consist of water ice. Mars's polar caps, however, are a combination of water ice and carbon-dioxide ice.
6293971	eng	The Martian polar caps thaw in summer and freeze in winter, showing that our solar system's planets are dynamic and changing.
6293972	eng	Some of the moons in the outer solar system are completely covered in ice. They don't have just polar caps. They have ice shells.
6293973	rus	Я упал с высоты.
6293974	eng	Scientists think there is water beneath the moon's icy crust.
6293975	eng	Earth's surface is covered mostly by water.
6293976	eng	Some of our solar-system neighbors may have oceans, too, but they are hidden from view under layers of ice.
6293977	rus	На этой кровати никто не спал.
6293978	eng	Beneath the icy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, lies a liquid ocean that may have more water than Earth contains.
6293979	eng	Images of Europa's surface show ice that has broken up into ice flows, suggesting that water beneath the surface is moving and cracking the ice.
6293980	eng	The ice on Europa is generally hundreds of miles thick.
6293981	eng	If you really want a place that harbors life, then Earth is it. Our planet is neither too hot nor too cold. It has fierce storms and winds, but not at the extremes seen elsewhere in the solar system.
6293982	eng	As scientists learn about our neighboring worlds, they realize how forbidding these places can be. They also document how wonderful our Earth is and how accommodating it is for life. Earth is our oasis in space.
6293983	eng	Earth is our oasis in space.
6293984	eng	Earth is our oasis.

6293987	eng	Haumea is an oddly-shaped dwarf planet.
6293988	srp	Да ли говориш кинески?
6293989	eng	Haumea spins rapidly, turning once every four hours, and is believed to be composed mostly of rock with a thin, icy shell and a dark red spot.
6293990	eng	Astronomers think a collision with a larger body caused the dwarf planet to lose its surface ice, producing the rapid spin.
6293991	eng	Haumea is named for the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Haumea's moons are named for the goddess' two daughters.
6293992	eng	Makemake was discovered in March 2005 and is classified as a dwarf planet. Its color is reddish-brown, and it has no atmosphere.
6293993	eng	Pluto was the smallest planet until August 2006, when the International Astronomical Union reclassified it as a dwarf planet. It is the largest dwarf planet known.
6293994	eng	Pluto is composed of a large rocky core wrapped in thick layers of ices.
6293995	rus	Что произошло в ту ночь?
6293996	eng	Pluto's icy surface and extremely thin atmosphere are predominantly composed of nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.
6293997	eng	Pluto's terrain shows remarkable variation including dark/bright regions and smooth/mountainous areas.
6293998	rus	Успокойся и расскажи всё по порядку.
6293999	eng	Pluto's atmosphere is hazy and extended enough that it is continually being lost into space through interaction with the solar wind.
6294000	eng	Pluto’s orbit is more elliptical and more inclined than the orbits of the eight solar system planets.
6294001	srp	Дај ми млеко.
6294002	eng	The key reason why Pluto is no longer considered a planet is that it is one among thousands to millions of other objects orbiting within the Kuiper Belt region. Also, the icy dwarf planet is not massive enough to clear debris from its orbit.
6294003	srp	Ја сам у Риму.
6294005	eng	Callisto, the outermost of the four Galilean moons, has an old surface that is perhaps the most heavily cratered of any object in the solar system.

6294008	eng	The largest object in the solar system is the sun. It contains 99 percent of the mass of the solar system.
6294010	eng	The sun is at the center of the solar system, and the planets, asteroids, moons, and comets orbit the sun.
6294011	eng	The Earth is the third planet from the sun.
6294012	eng	Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, and Earth is the fifth-largest.
6294013	eng	Earth and Venus have a couple of things in common: they are rocky planets and are about the same size.
6294014	eng	Venus is different in many ways from Earth. Venus has a harsh environment, is very hot, and has a poisonous atmosphere with acid clouds.
6294015	eng	Mars is about half the size of Earth.
6294016	eng	The planets are different sizes. From smallest to largest they are: Mercury, Mars, Venus, Earth, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter.

6294020	eng	Venus and Earth are roughly the same size.
6294021	eng	The sun is the closest star to Earth and provides us with most of our energy and light.
6294022	eng	Earth turns on its axis once every day.
6294023	eng	When we experience darkness, we are facing away from the sun. When we experience daylight, we are facing the sun.
6294024	eng	We can't see other stars during the day because the sun's light illuminates Earth's atmosphere.
6294025	eng	The sun is glowing, not burning like a fire.
6294026	eng	The sun glows because its temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius.
6294027	rus	Я принёс тебе поесть.

6294032	eng	The temperature of a wood fire is less than a thousand degrees Fahrenheit.
6294033	eng	Nuclear fusion takes place deep in the sun's core at a temperature of about 15 million degrees Celsius. As the heat travels out through the sun's layers, it becomes much cooler, but still hot enough to glow in visible light.
6294034	rus	Том тебя везде искал.
6294035	rus	Том спросил у меня, знаю ли я телефон Мэри.
6294036	deu	Sie schlug mich auf den Kopf und rannte weg.
6294037	eng	The inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) are closer together than the outer ones (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune).
6294038	eng	The inner planets are closest to the sun. The outer planets are farthest away from the sun.
6294039	deu	Sie hat mich auf den Kopf geschlagen und ist weggerannt.

6294043	eng	Comets occasionally visit the inner solar system from their home in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud.
6294044	eng	Although comets and asteroids are both tiny objects that orbit in the solar system, their composition differs. Asteroids are mostly rock with some ice, while comets are mostly ice with some rock.
6294045	eng	Comets do not always have tails. They develop a fuzzy, shell-like cloud called a coma, and one, two, or three tails when near the sun.
6294046	eng	Comets have no coma or tail when far away from the sun.
6294047	deu	Er trocknete seine verschwitzte Stirn ab.
6294048	eng	Comets are part of the solar system. Scientists believe they come from one of two locations within the solar system: the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud.
6294049	deu	Er hat seine verschwitzte Stirn abgetrocknet.
6294050	eng	The comets that we see often — every 100 years — come from the Kuiper Belt.

6294052	deu	Der Arzt riet ihm, weniger zu arbeiten.
6294053	eng	Meteors are the bright flashes of light seen in the night sky. They are caused by meteoroids — small, solid objects moving through space that have entered Earth's atmosphere.
6294054	eng	Usually, meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere and never reach the ground. A meteorite is the chunk of material that does reach the ground.
6294055	eng	A meteor is a bright streak of light in the sky caused when a meteoroid (a small chunk of rock or ice) enters the Earth's atmosphere and heats up.
6294056	eng	Asteroids are not close to each other. They are roughly 1 million miles from each other.
6294057	deu	Der Arzt hat ihm geraten, weniger zu arbeiten.
6294058	eng	There is only one star, the sun, in the solar system.

6294061	eng	Many other stars are outside our solar system, but part of our Milky Way galaxy.
6294062	eng	Galaxies contain from tens of millions to trillions of stars.
6294063	eng	Scientists are sending out spacecraft and pointing telescopes to learn more about the solar system.
6294064	eng	Among the many questions scientists are trying to answer are whether Mars has liquid water and how the solar system was formed.
6294065	eng	The absolute brightness or magnitude of an object is the apparent brightness or magnitude it would have if it were located exactly 10 parsecs away.
6294066	deu	Ich bin seit mehr als zwanzig Jahren mit ihm befreundet.
6294067	eng	The apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.

A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."

6310102	eng	I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his brows drawn down over his eyes.
6310103	eng	"Stangerson too!" he muttered. "The plot thickens."
6310104	eng	I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.
6310105	eng	I was the first to discover what had occurred.
6310106	eng	The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.
6310107	eng	I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats.

6310119	eng	The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in.
6310120	eng	The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his nightdress.
6310121	por	Vocês já escolheram?
6310122	eng	He was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold.
6310123	por	Já escolheste?
6310124	eng	The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.
6310125	eng	"And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?" I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. "The word RACHE, written in letters of blood," he said.
6310126	eng	We were all silent for a while.
6310127	eng	There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes.
6310128	eng	My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle, tingled as I thought of it.
6310129	eng	A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel.
6310130	eng	The man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat.
6310131	eng	We found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.
6310132	eng	"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?" he asked.
6310133	eng	Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken.
6310134	eng	Whatever the motive of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.
6310135	eng	There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.'

6310144	eng	There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.
6310145	eng	Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. "The last link," he cried, exultantly. "My case is complete."
6310146	eng	The two detectives stared at him in amazement.
6310147	eng	"I have now in my hands," my companion said, confidently, "all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts."
6310148	eng	I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms.

6310157	por	Já estamos casados.
6310158	eng	"All this seems strange to you," continued Holmes, "because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it."
6310159	por	Vocês já ganharam.
6310160	por	Já ganhaste.
6310161	eng	It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious, because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn.
6310162	eng	This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.

6310178	rus	Ты вернул свои деньги?
6310179	eng	"There will be no more murders," he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. "You can put that consideration out of the question."
6310180	eng	You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him.
6310181	eng	I wonder who sent the flowers.
6310182	rus	Моя младшая сестра немного ленивая.
6310183	eng	Mary received flowers from a secret admirer.

6310208	eng	Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.
6310209	eng	It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.
