6267282	eng	What are you listening to?
6267283	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still at home.
6267284	eng	Tom will most likely do that.
6267285	eng	We're looking for options.
6267286	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at cooking.
6267287	eng	Tom will likely be terrified.
6267288	eng	We'll go to Boston by car.
6267289	eng	Tom said Mary has always lived in Boston.
6267290	eng	Tom will likely be suspended.
6267291	eng	We were forced to do that.
6267292	eng	Tom said Mary has to do that by herself.
6267293	eng	Tom will likely be surprised.
6267294	eng	We speak French every day.
6267295	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John's dog.
6267296	eng	Tom will likely be skeptical.
6267297	eng	We seldom do that anymore.
6267298	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John dance.
6267299	eng	Tom will likely be impressed.
6267300	eng	We plan to attack at dawn.
6267301	eng	Tom said Mary has never met his parents.
6267302	eng	Tom will likely be here soon.
6267303	eng	We often listen to Mozart.
6267304	eng	Tom said Mary has been told not do that.
6267305	eng	Tom will likely be exhausted.
6267306	eng	We don't have tickets yet.
6267307	eng	Tom said Mary has been to Boston before.
6267308	eng	Tom will likely be concerned.
6267309	eng	We could buy that for you.
6267310	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked to do that.
6267311	eng	Tom will likely be back soon.
6267312	eng	We can't go to Boston yet.
6267313	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that by herself.
6267314	eng	Tom will likely be awake now.
6267315	eng	We can't go to Boston now.
6267316	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is.
6267317	eng	Tom will do that if possible.
6267318	eng	We agreed to speak French.
6267319	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary did that.
6267320	eng	Tom will come this week, too.
6267321	eng	We agreed to go to Boston.
6267322	eng	Tom often does the same thing Mary does.
6267323	eng	Tom will be glad he did that.
6267324	eng	Was yesterday a sunny day?
6267325	eng	Tom must've thought Mary had to do that.
6267326	eng	Tom will be awake in an hour.
6267327	eng	This is my neighbor's dog.
6267328	eng	Tom likes the way Mary plays the guitar.
6267329	eng	Tom went out to get some air.
6267330	eng	This is an excellent wine.
6267331	eng	Tom let Mary know that he had done that.
6267332	eng	Tom wasn't really good to me.
6267333	eng	This is a tough situation.
6267334	eng	Tom knows Mary won't be able to do that.
6267335	eng	Tom wasn't afraid to do that.
6267336	eng	This is a comfortable bed.
6267337	eng	Tom knows Mary no longer has to do that.
6267338	eng	Tom was wounded and captured.
6267339	eng	This is a bad translation.
6267340	eng	Tom isn't as young as Mary thinks he is.
6267341	eng	Tom was sleeping on the sofa.
6267342	eng	They say it gets hot here.
6267343	eng	Tom informed Mary why he had to do that.
6267344	eng	Tom was permitted to do that.
6267345	eng	They live in another city.
6267346	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that again.
6267347	eng	Tom was motivated to do that.
6267348	eng	They don't want to see me.
6267349	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she should do.
6267350	eng	Tom was helping us with that.
6267351	eng	These things belong to me.
6267352	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she has to do.
6267353	eng	Tom was fired for doing that.
6267354	eng	These glasses aren't mine.
6267355	eng	Tom has told Mary to do that by herself.
6267356	eng	Tom was doing that yesterday.
6267357	eng	These don't belong to me.
6267358	eng	Tom has spoken to Mary about the matter.
6267359	eng	Tom was desperate to do that.
6267360	eng	The sun rises in the east.
6267361	eng	Tom has said he won't help Mary anymore.
6267362	eng	Tom was charged with perjury.
6267363	eng	The snow isn't letting up.
6267364	eng	Tom has known Mary for a very long time.
6267365	eng	Tom was certainly not amused.
6267366	eng	The lake is far from here.
6267367	eng	Tom has done what Mary wanted him to do.
6267368	eng	Tom warned me not to do that.
6267369	eng	That's what I want to eat.
6267370	eng	Tom has advised Mary to stop doing that.
6267371	eng	Tom wants to buy another car.
6267372	eng	That's what I want to buy.
6267373	eng	Tom has a lot more books than Mary does.
6267374	eng	Tom wants me to study French.
6267375	eng	That seems to be the plan.
6267376	eng	Tom has Mary to show him how to do that.
6267377	eng	Tom very seldom has homework.
6267378	eng	Stop doing that right now.
6267379	eng	Tom had a hunch that Mary would do that.
6267380	eng	Tom usually seems to do that.
6267381	eng	Please don't do that here.
6267382	eng	Tom explicitly told Mary not to do that.
6267383	eng	Tom usually keeps to himself.
6267384	eng	Please do that if you can.
6267385	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be jealous.
6267386	eng	Tom usually does that for us.
6267387	eng	People here don't do that.
6267388	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be stubborn.
6267389	eng	Tom usually does that for me.
6267390	eng	Our flight leaves at 2:30.
6267391	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be punctual.
6267392	eng	Tom used to enjoy doing that.
6267393	eng	Our company is in trouble.
6267394	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be confused.
6267395	eng	Tom used to dance quite well.
6267396	eng	One of you has to do that.
6267397	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be careless.
6267398	eng	Tom urged me to study French.
6267399	eng	One of my cats is missing.
6267400	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
6267401	eng	Tom tried to win the contest.
6267402	eng	Now's the time to do that.
6267403	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary ought to do that.
6267404	eng	Tom took the lid off the box.
6267405	eng	None of them will do that.
6267406	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary needs to do that.
6267407	eng	Tom told us he would do that.
6267408	eng	Nobody thought about that.
6267409	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary meant to do that.
6267410	eng	Tom told us he couldn't help.
6267411	eng	No issue is a small issue.
6267412	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary knows what to do.
6267413	eng	Tom told us he could do that.
6267414	eng	My parents have separated.
6267416	eng	Tom told me that he's sleepy.
6267417	eng	My life is back to normal.
6267418	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary does that.
6267419	eng	Tom told me that he's scared.
6267420	eng	My favorite food is pizza.
6267421	eng	Tom doesn't like science, but Mary does.
6267422	eng	Tom told me that he's lonely.
6267423	eng	My father was a policeman.
6267424	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary would do that.
6267425	eng	Tom told me that he's afraid.
6267426	eng	My family lives in Boston.
6267427	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary is doing that.
6267428	eng	Tom told me he would do that.
6267429	eng	My family is here with me.
6267430	eng	Tom doesn't know who taught Mary French.
6267431	eng	Tom told me he won't do that.
6267432	eng	My dog still bites people.
6267433	eng	Tom didn't understand why Mary did that.
6267434	eng	Tom told me I should do that.
6267435	eng	My confidence is wavering.
6267436	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be punctual.
6267437	eng	Tom thought he could help us.
6267438	eng	My computer isn't working.
6267439	eng	Tom didn't tell me Mary was his ex-wife.
6267440	eng	Tom thinks he's good-looking.
6267441	eng	My car's parked out front.
6267442	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she has to do.
6267443	eng	Tom thinks he should do that.
6267444	eng	My car is in the driveway.
6267445	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he has to buy.
6267446	eng	Tom thinks I know what to do.
6267447	eng	My car has been impounded.
6267448	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he had to buy.
6267449	eng	Tom thinks I have to do that.
6267450	eng	My boss is very demanding.
6267451	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary had to do that.
6267452	eng	Tom swore he'd never do that.
6267453	eng	My birthday was yesterday.
6267454	eng	Tom didn't do what Mary asked him to do.
6267455	eng	Tom swears he didn't do that.
6267456	eng	Monday will be a cold day.
6267457	eng	Tom did what he could to calm Mary down.
6267458	eng	Tom sure has done a good job.
6267459	eng	Monday will be a busy day.
6267460	eng	Tom denied that he told Mary to do that.
6267461	eng	Tom suggested we leave early.
6267462	eng	Make sure you do that, OK?
6267463	eng	Tom believed that Mary wouldn't do that.
6267464	eng	Tom still refuses to do that.
6267466	eng	Tom believed that Mary couldn't do that.
6267467	eng	Tom still hasn't answered me.
6267468	eng	Let's go out on the porch.
6267469	eng	Tom asked if Mary really had to do that.
6267470	eng	Tom still can't speak French.
6267471	eng	Let them buy that for you.
6267472	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to work late.
6267473	eng	Tom started out as a janitor.
6267474	eng	It's your turn to do that.
6267475	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like John.
6267476	eng	Tom started out as a drummer.
6267477	eng	Tom asked Mary why he needed to do that.
6267478	eng	Tom spoke very highly of you.
6267479	eng	It's way past my bed time.
6267480	eng	Tom asked Mary where she wanted to work.
6267481	eng	Tom sold his house last week.
6267482	eng	It's too early to do that.
6267483	eng	Tom asked Mary where she parked the car.
6267484	eng	Tom should've been terrified.
6267485	eng	It's necessary to do that.
6267486	eng	Tom asked Mary what kind of car she had.
6267487	eng	Tom should've been suspended.
6267488	eng	It's important to do that.
6267489	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to do that.
6267490	eng	Tom should've been surprised.
6267491	eng	It's humid here in Boston.
6267492	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that.
6267493	eng	Tom should've been skeptical.
6267494	eng	It's foggy here in Boston.
6267495	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that.
6267496	eng	Tom should've been impressed.
6267497	eng	It's dangerous to do that.
6267498	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew who John was.
6267499	eng	Tom should've been a teacher.
6267500	eng	It's almost time to leave.
6267501	eng	Tom and Mary like the same kind of food.
6267502	eng	Tom should wait until Monday.
6267503	eng	It's all right to do that.
6267504	eng	Tom and Mary have several grandchildren.
6267505	eng	Tom should do that right now.
6267506	eng	It'll be risky to do that.
6267507	eng	Tom and Mary aren't supposed to do that.
6267508	eng	Tom should be retired by now.
6267509	eng	It'll be cheap to do that.
6267510	eng	Tom and I sat across from John and Mary.
6267511	eng	Tom should be home on Monday.
6267512	eng	It wasn't me who did that.
6267513	eng	Tom and I are in the same class as Mary.
6267514	eng	Tom should be doing that now.
6267515	eng	It was too hot to do that.
6267516	eng	Tom and I are here to help Mary do that.
6267517	eng	Tom should be asked to leave.
6267518	eng	It costs money to do that.
6267519	eng	Tom and I are both Mary's ex-boyfriends.
6267520	eng	Tom seldom gets here on time.
6267521	eng	Is it humid now in Boston?
6267522	eng	Tom advised Mary to go there by bicycle.
6267523	eng	Tom seldom forgot to do that.
6267524	eng	Is it foggy now in Boston?
6267525	eng	Tom admits that he stole Mary's jewelry.
6267526	eng	Tom seems to want to do that.
6267527	eng	I've only done that twice.
6267528	eng	The one who helped Tom do that was Mary.
6267529	eng	Tom seems to like doing that.
6267530	eng	I've never done that here.
6267531	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary did that yesterday.
6267532	eng	Tom seems to be feeling fine.
6267533	eng	I've just spent three hours studying French.
6267534	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why Mary is here.
6267535	eng	Tom seemed to be very sleepy.
6267536	eng	I've decided to volunteer.
6267537	eng	Maybe Tom can talk Mary into doing that.
6267538	eng	Tom seemed to be very hungry.
6267539	eng	I've decided not to leave.
6267540	eng	I told Tom I didn't know Mary very well.
6267541	eng	Tom says he's good at French.
6267542	eng	I've been very happy here.
6267543	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary will do that.
6267544	eng	Tom says he's been to Boston.
6267545	eng	I've been told to do that.
6267546	eng	I don't think Tom will do that for Mary.
6267547	eng	Tom says he'll do that today.
6267548	eng	I've been here since 2003.
6267549	eng	I don't like the way Tom smiles at Mary.
6267550	eng	Tom says he'll do that later.
6267551	eng	I've been arrested before.
6267552	eng	I don't know Tom as well as I know Mary.
6267553	eng	Tom says he'd rather go home.
6267554	eng	I've always loved history.
6267555	eng	I didn't pay Tom as much as I paid Mary.
6267556	eng	Tom says he wouldn't do that.
6267557	eng	I'm waiting for my change.
6267558	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's uncle.
6267559	eng	Tom says he ought to do that.
6267560	eng	I'm too young to buy beer.
6267561	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were married.
6267562	eng	Tom says he needs to do that.
6267563	eng	I'm too stupid to do that.
6267564	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were cousins.
6267565	eng	Tom said the concert was fun.
6267566	eng	I'm too sleepy to do that.
6267567	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were an item.
6267568	eng	Tom said that'll happen soon.
6267569	eng	I'm staying in Boston now.
6267570	eng	Didn't you know Tom was older than Mary?
6267571	eng	Tom said that he wasn't busy.
6267572	eng	I'm ready to leave Boston.
6267573	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
6267574	eng	Tom said last year was tough.
6267575	eng	I'm ready to go to Boston.
6267576	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's daughter?
6267577	eng	Tom said it felt good to win.
6267578	eng	I'm rather busy right now.
6267579	eng	You should tell Tom Mary won't do that.
6267580	eng	Tom said it couldn't be done.
6267581	eng	I'm not the only survivor.
6267582	eng	You should tell Tom Mary will do that.
6267583	eng	Tom said he's ready to leave.
6267584	eng	I'm not sure how to react.
6267585	eng	You should tell Tom Mary can't do that.
6267586	eng	Tom said he's doing that now.
6267587	eng	I'm not really interested.
6267588	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he did that.
6267589	eng	Tom said he's been to Boston.
6267590	eng	I'm not ready to quit yet.
6267591	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if Mary did that.
6267592	eng	Tom said he'll do that later.
6267593	eng	I'm not interested in art.
6267594	eng	Tom would've permitted Mary to do that.
6267595	eng	Tom said he'd win and he did.
6267596	eng	I'm not afraid to do that.
6267597	eng	Tom would never permit Mary to do that.
6267598	eng	Tom said he'd rather go home.
6267599	eng	I'm just about to do that.
6267600	eng	Tom would do that if Mary asked him to.
6267601	eng	Tom said he'd likely do that.
6267602	eng	I'm hoping you'll do that.
6267603	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to live.
6267604	eng	Tom said he'd do that for us.
6267605	eng	I'm going to visit Boston.
6267606	eng	Tom won't permit Mary to do that again.
6267607	eng	Tom said he wasn't in Boston.
6267608	eng	I'm glad I went to Boston.
6267609	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's sleepy.
6267610	eng	Tom said he wasn't convinced.
6267611	eng	I'm glad I visited Boston.
6267612	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's hungry.
6267613	eng	Tom said he wants to do that.
6267614	eng	I'm glad I studied French.
6267615	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's tired.
6267616	eng	Tom said he tried to do that.
6267617	eng	I'm glad I came to Boston.
6267618	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's sorry.
6267619	eng	Tom said he prefers red wine.
6267620	eng	I'm feeling a little weak.
6267621	eng	Tom wasn't sure Mary needed to do that.
6267622	eng	Tom said he ought to do that.
6267623	eng	I'm eager to visit Boston.
6267624	eng	Tom was impressed by how Mary did that.
6267625	eng	Tom said he needs to do that.
6267626	eng	I'm eager to go to Boston.
6267627	eng	Tom warned Mary not to drink the water.
6267628	eng	Tom said he hasn't done that.
6267629	eng	I'm determined to do that.
6267630	eng	Tom wants me to go to Boston with Mary.
6267631	eng	Tom said he had to walk home.
6267632	eng	I'm capable of doing that.
6267633	eng	Tom wanted to show Mary how to do that.
6267634	eng	Tom said he had to stay home.
6267635	eng	I'll try to do that today.
6267636	eng	Tom tried to talk Mary into doing that.
6267637	eng	Tom said he doesn't eat pork.
6267638	eng	I'll try to do that again.
6267639	eng	Tom tried to keep Mary from doing that.
6267640	eng	Tom said he didn't like dogs.
6267641	eng	I'll play tennis tomorrow.
6267642	eng	Tom told Mary why he wanted to do that.
6267643	eng	Tom said he didn't know this.
6267644	eng	I'll invite you next time.
6267645	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed to do that.
6267646	eng	Tom said he did that in 2013.
6267647	eng	I'll do that after dinner.
6267648	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed more money.
6267649	eng	Tom said he did that for you.
6267650	eng	I'd still like to do that.
6267651	eng	Tom told Mary what he wanted her to do.
6267652	eng	Tom said I ought not do that.
6267653	eng	I'd rather do that myself.
6267654	eng	Tom told Mary what he needed her to do.
6267655	eng	Tom said I needed to do that.
6267656	eng	I'd be tempted to do that.
6267657	eng	Tom told Mary they could do that today.
6267658	eng	Tom said I looked ridiculous.
6267659	eng	I'd be pleased to do that.
6267660	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been careful.

6268052	eng	I hate sitting in traffic.
6268053	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still grumpy.
6268054	eng	Tom hopes that his team wins.
6268055	eng	I had to be there by 2:30.
6268056	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still afraid.
6268057	eng	Tom helps out any way he can.
6268058	eng	I had intended to do that.
6268059	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at French.
6268060	eng	Tom hasn't agreed to do that.
6268061	eng	I had better things to do.
6268062	eng	Tom said Mary is determined to do that.
6268063	eng	Tom has to be home on Monday.
6268064	eng	I guess it's too late now.
6268065	eng	Tom said Mary has seen John doing that.
6268066	eng	Tom has three granddaughters.
6268067	eng	I got tired of doing that.
6268068	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen him dance.
6268069	eng	Tom has never studied acting.
6268070	eng	I go to Boston every week.
6268071	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John swim.
6268072	eng	Tom has never ever done that.
6268073	eng	I found something strange.
6268074	eng	Tom said Mary has never been to Boston.
6268075	eng	Tom has never been on a date.
6268076	eng	I feel uncomfortable here.
6268077	eng	Tom said Mary has done that many times.
6268078	eng	Tom has done the right thing.
6268079	eng	I draw pictures every day.
6268080	eng	Tom said Mary has been very happy here.
6268081	eng	Tom has done that, hasn't he?
6268082	eng	I don't want to go either.
6268083	eng	Tom said Mary has been told to do that.
6268084	eng	Tom has done that on purpose.
6268085	eng	I don't want to be lonely.
6268086	eng	Tom said Mary has been arrested before.
6268087	eng	Tom has done a very nice job.
6268088	eng	I don't want to be caught.
6268089	eng	Tom said Mary has always been athletic.
6268090	eng	Tom has been crying all day.
6268091	eng	I don't want to apologize.
6268092	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that with John.
6268093	eng	Tom has been told to do that.
6268094	eng	I don't think that's mine.
6268095	eng	Tom said Mary had the right to do that.
6268096	eng	Tom has been doing that well.
6268098	eng	Tom promised to go to Boston with Mary.
6268099	eng	Tom has apparently done that.
6268100	eng	I don't really want to go.
6268101	eng	Tom probably knows where Mary was born.
6268102	eng	Tom has always been friendly.
6268103	eng	I don't read much anymore.
6268104	eng	Tom poured some wine into Mary's glass.
6268106	eng	I don't often wear a suit.
6268107	eng	Tom must've thought Mary could do that.
6268108	eng	Tom has a grandson in Boston.
6268109	eng	I don't often eat at home.
6268110	eng	Tom likes the way Mary makes spaghetti.
6268111	eng	Tom has a dry sense of humor.
6268112	eng	I don't need to buy a car.
6268113	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said did that.
6268114	eng	Tom has a bar on Park Street.
6268115	eng	I don't need an assistant.
6268116	eng	Tom knew Mary no longer had to do that.
6268117	eng	Tom had to work hard all day.
6268118	eng	I don't like to wear ties.
6268119	eng	Tom is very sure Mary needs to do that.
6268120	eng	Tom had no chance to do that.
6268121	eng	I don't like this one bit.
6268122	eng	Tom is the only person Mary knows here.
6268123	eng	Tom had his appendix removed.
6268124	eng	I don't like the new plan.
6268125	eng	Tom is the one who helped Mary do that.
6268126	eng	Tom had a hammer in his hand.
6268127	eng	I don't like taking risks.
6268128	eng	Tom is the oldest of Mary's three sons.
6268129	eng	Tom had a duplicate key made.
6268130	eng	I don't like riding buses.
6268131	eng	Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary.
6268132	eng	Tom got married before I did.
6268133	eng	I don't like poker at all.
6268134	eng	Tom is going to permit Mary to do that.
6268135	eng	Tom got home around midnight.
6268136	eng	I don't like being pushed.
6268137	eng	Tom is at least twice as heavy as Mary.
6268138	eng	Tom got fired for doing that.
6268139	eng	I don't know who to blame.
6268140	eng	Tom has told Mary she needs to do that.
6268141	eng	Tom got fined for doing that.
6268142	eng	I don't know how to reply.
6268143	eng	Tom has told Mary not to do that again.
6268144	eng	Tom got everything he needed.
6268145	eng	I don't have that problem.
6268146	eng	Tom has more experience than Mary does.
6268147	eng	Tom got a job at a drugstore.
6268148	eng	I don't have much luggage.
6268149	eng	Tom has decided to cooperate with Mary.
6268150	eng	Tom gestured for me to leave.
6268151	eng	I don't have many options.
6268152	eng	Tom has been here with Mary many times.
6268153	eng	Tom found it hard to do that.
6268154	eng	I don't have long to live.
6268155	eng	Tom has asked Mary to help him do that.
6268156	eng	Tom flew to Boston on Monday.

6268158	eng	Tom had no idea what Mary wanted to do.
6268159	eng	Tom fired back at the police.
6268160	eng	I don't have a smartphone.
6268161	eng	Tom had no idea what Mary needed to do.
6268162	eng	Tom figured he could do that.
6268163	eng	I don't have a lot to say.
6268164	eng	Tom gave Mary what little money he had.
6268165	eng	Tom encouraged us to do that.
6268166	eng	I don't get much time off.
6268167	eng	Tom expected Mary to solve the problem.
6268168	eng	Tom encouraged me to do that.
6268169	eng	I don't eat a lot of meat.
6268170	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to do that alone.

6268180	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be drunk.
6268181	eng	I don't care what you eat.
6268182	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be nervous.
6268183	eng	Tom doesn't normally do that.
6268184	eng	I don't always get my way.
6268185	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be jealous.
6268186	eng	Tom doesn't like to be early.
6268187	eng	I do that on Mondays, too.
6268188	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be careful.
6268189	eng	Tom doesn't like sports much.
6268190	eng	I didn't worry about that.
6268191	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary did.
6268192	eng	Tom doesn't like hot weather.
6268193	eng	I didn't work last Monday.
6268194	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary did that.
6268195	eng	Tom doesn't like his new job.

6268202	eng	I didn't want to go there.
6268203	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is Canadian.

6268206	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
6268207	eng	Tom doesn't care what you do.
6268208	eng	I didn't wait for my turn.
6268209	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary would do that.
6268210	eng	Tom does what he can to help.
6268211	eng	I didn't tell anyone else.
6268212	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be worried.
6268213	eng	Tom does that faster than me.
6268214	eng	I didn't see anybody else.
6268215	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be nervous.
6268216	eng	Tom does shave every morning.
6268217	eng	I didn't need to buy this.
6268218	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be jealous.
6268219	eng	Tom does seem awfully sleepy.
6268220	eng	I didn't move fast enough.
6268221	eng	Tom didn't think Mary ought to do that.
6268222	eng	Tom didn't want to go to bed.
6268223	eng	I didn't miss the meeting.

6268229	eng	I didn't know where I was.
6268230	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary which book to buy.
6268231	eng	Tom didn't think we did that.
6268232	eng	I didn't know what to buy.
6268233	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he has to do.
6268234	eng	Tom didn't seem to notice it.
6268235	eng	I didn't know their names.
6268236	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he can't eat.
6268237	eng	Tom didn't seem to be amused.
6268238	eng	I didn't have my shoes on.
6268239	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary his job was tough.
6268240	eng	Tom didn't regret doing that.
6268241	eng	I didn't have my boots on.
6268242	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary about the robbery.
6268243	eng	Tom didn't receive any reply.
6268244	eng	I didn't have any privacy.
6268245	eng	Tom didn't notice that Mary was crying.
6268246	eng	Tom didn't react fast enough.
6268247	eng	I didn't go to work today.
6268248	eng	Tom didn't like what he saw Mary doing.
6268249	eng	Tom didn't know who to trust.
6268250	eng	I didn't go into the cave.
6268251	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary's house was.
6268252	eng	Tom didn't hesitate a second.
6268253	eng	I didn't go in right away.
6268254	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was Canadian.
6268255	eng	Tom didn't finish doing that.
6268256	eng	I didn't follow the rules.
6268257	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wanted to do that.
6268258	eng	Tom didn't do that yesterday.
6268259	eng	I didn't flush the toilet.
6268260	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so hungry.
6268261	eng	Tom didn't do that very well.
6268262	eng	I didn't finish my dinner.
6268263	eng	Tom didn't do what Mary told him to do.
6268264	eng	Tom didn't do that very long.
6268265	eng	I didn't feel like eating.
6268266	eng	Tom did whatever Mary wanted him to do.
6268267	eng	Tom didn't do that last week.
6268268	eng	I didn't feel embarrassed.
6268269	eng	Tom did what Mary said he needed to do.
6268270	eng	Tom didn't do that after all.
6268271	eng	I didn't exactly say that.
6268272	eng	Tom did all he could to calm Mary down.
6268273	eng	Tom did that wrong last time.
6268274	eng	I didn't do that with you.
6268275	eng	Tom couldn't teach Mary how to do that.
6268276	eng	Tom did that without my help.
6268277	eng	I didn't do anything else.
6268278	eng	Tom couldn't talk Mary into doing that.
6268279	eng	Tom did that with enthusiasm.
6268280	eng	I didn't check my mailbox.
6268281	eng	Tom couldn't find what Mary had hidden.
6268282	eng	Tom did that three years ago.
6268283	eng	I didn't break my promise.
6268284	eng	Tom convinced Mary to teach him French.
6268285	eng	Tom did that right this time.
6268286	eng	I didn't ask for anything.
6268287	eng	Tom complained to Mary about the noise.
6268288	eng	Tom did that for three hours.
6268289	eng	I didn't agree to do that.
6268290	eng	Tom blamed Mary for all their problems.
6268291	eng	Tom did that for his brother.
6268292	eng	I didn't actually do that.
6268293	eng	Tom assured Mary that he would do that.
6268294	eng	Tom did that for a long time.
6268295	eng	I did that yesterday, too.
6268296	eng	Tom assured Mary that he could do that.
6268297	eng	Tom did that for a few years.
6268298	eng	I did that very carefully.
6268299	eng	Tom asked if Mary had to do that today.
6268300	eng	Tom did that a long time ago.
6268302	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like him.
6268303	eng	Tom couldn't do that anymore.
6268304	eng	I did that in three hours.
6268305	eng	Tom asked Mary what she was looking at.
6268306	eng	Tom could still be at school.
6268307	eng	I couldn't catch the ball.
6268308	eng	Tom asked Mary what her conclusion was.
6268309	eng	Tom could end up being fired.
6268310	eng	I cooked dinner on Monday.
6268311	eng	Tom apologized to Mary for what he did.
6268312	eng	Tom complained about his job.
6268313	eng	I can't work this evening.
6268314	eng	Tom and Mary have never been on a date.
6268315	eng	Tom comes home at about 6:30.
6268316	eng	I can't understand French.
6268317	eng	Tom and Mary have become close friends.
6268318	eng	Tom claimed he could do that.
6268319	eng	I can't speak much French.
6268320	eng	Tom and Mary are still studying French.
6268321	eng	Tom can't do that by himself.
6268322	eng	I can't go anywhere today.
6268323	eng	Tom and I were the ones who found Mary.
6268324	eng	Tom can't do that any longer.
6268325	eng	I can't get this jar open.
6268326	eng	Tom and I want to know more about Mary.
6268327	eng	Tom buys and sells old coins.
6268328	eng	I can't get my gloves off.
6268329	eng	I want Tom to show Mary how to do that.
6268330	eng	Tom bought himself a new car.
6268331	eng	I can't find my left shoe.
6268332	eng	I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
6268333	eng	Tom begged me not to do that.
6268334	eng	I can't do that by myself.
6268335	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't like Mary.
6268336	eng	Tom became a police sergeant.
6268337	eng	I can do that blindfolded.
6268338	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary broke up.
6268339	eng	Tom baked bread this morning.
6268340	eng	I can buy anything I want.
6268341	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my fiancée.
6268342	eng	Tom ate someone else's apple.
6268343	eng	I came to Boston ages ago.
6268344	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's husband?
6268345	eng	Tom ate a sandwich for lunch.
6268346	eng	I already know the secret.
6268347	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?
6268348	eng	Tom asked us why we did that.
6268349	eng	I accidentally cut myself.
6268350	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's ex-wife?
6268351	eng	Tom asked me if I liked math.
6268352	eng	How often do you get sick?
6268353	eng	Did you know Tom was younger than Mary?
6268354	eng	Tom asked me if I liked jazz.
6268355	eng	How often do you eat meat?
6268356	eng	Did you know Tom was Mary's ex-husband?
6268357	eng	Tom asked me about something.
6268358	eng	How often do you buy eggs?
6268359	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary were married?
6268360	eng	Tom and only Tom can do that.
6268361	eng	How much salt did you add?
6268362	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary were an item?
6268363	eng	Tom and I've talked about it.
6268364	eng	How many cookies are left?
6268366	eng	Tom and I weren't that close.
6268367	eng	How did you know his name?
6268368	eng	Tom's car cost a lot more than Mary's.
6268369	eng	Tom and I went out to dinner.
6268370	eng	Haven't you done that yet?
6268371	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary how to do that.
6268372	eng	Tom and I went out for lunch.
6268373	eng	Have you fixed everything?
6268374	eng	Tom wouldn't have helped Mary do that.
6268375	eng	Tom and I wanted to be alone.
6268376	eng	Have you ever owned a car?
6268377	eng	Tom would've done that if Mary hadn't.
6268378	eng	Tom and I used to be married.
6268379	eng	Have you broken any rules?
6268380	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to sit.
6268381	eng	Tom and I used to be engaged.
6268382	eng	Has a solution been found.
6268383	eng	Tom wondered where Mary could've gone.
6268384	eng	Tom and I talked about music.
6268385	eng	Giving up isn't an option.
6268386	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's tired.
6268387	eng	Tom and I still aren't ready.
6268388	eng	Don't you wish to do that?
6268389	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's sorry.
6268390	eng	Tom and I spoke on the phone.
6268391	eng	Don't you like to do that?
6268392	eng	Tom won't likely speak French to Mary.
6268393	eng	Tom and I should do that now.
6268394	eng	Don't drink anything else.
6268395	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's busy.
6268396	eng	Tom and I often jog together.
6268397	eng	Don't do that by yourself.
6268398	eng	Tom will give Mary what she asked for.
6268399	eng	Tom and I often go to Boston.
6268400	eng	Don't ask silly questions.
6268401	eng	Tom went into the cave to rescue Mary.
6268402	eng	Tom and I never eat together.
6268403	eng	Doing that's illegal here.
6268404	eng	Tom wasn't surprised by what Mary did.
6268405	eng	Tom and I met in high school.
6268406	eng	Doing that would be wrong.
6268407	eng	Tom was worried Mary wouldn't do that.
6268408	eng	Tom and I have similar goals.
6268409	eng	Doing that would be scary.
6268410	eng	Tom was the one who made Mary do that.
6268411	eng	Tom and I have been drinking.
6268412	eng	Doing that wasn't so easy.
6268413	eng	Tom was lucky Mary helped him do that.
6268414	eng	Tom and I have been arrested.
6268415	eng	Do you still teach French?
6268416	eng	Tom visited Mary in Boston in October.
6268417	eng	Tom and I had a pillow fight.
6268418	eng	Do you still study French?
6268419	eng	Tom tried to show Mary how to do that.
6268420	eng	Tom and I had a disagreement.
6268421	eng	Do you still speak French?
6268422	eng	Tom told Mary why he had to work late.
6268423	eng	Tom and I go to the same gym.
6268424	eng	Do you still do that here?
6268425	eng	Tom told Mary why he enjoyed swimming.
6268426	eng	Tom and I fight all the time.
6268427	eng	Do you speak French often?
6268428	eng	Tom told Mary why he couldn't do that.
6268429	eng	Tom and I each took a cookie.
6268430	eng	Do you live with your son?
6268431	eng	Tom told Mary what she wanted to know.
6268432	eng	Tom and I don't study French.

6268828	eng	Tom seemed to be very tired.
6268829	eng	The case has been closed.
6268830	eng	Tom said Mary didn't care what we did.
6268831	eng	Tom seemed to be very happy.
6268832	eng	That's a sensitive issue.
6268833	eng	Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
6268834	eng	Tom seemed to be very angry.
6268835	eng	That car used to be mine.
6268836	eng	Tom said Mary couldn't do that either.
6268837	eng	Tom seemed to be having fun.
6268838	eng	Tell me how you did that.
6268839	eng	Tom put his hands on Mary's shoulders.
6268840	eng	Tom seemed tired and hungry.
6268841	eng	Some things won't change.
6268842	eng	Tom ought to tell Mary not to do that.
6268843	eng	Tom scared me half to death.
6268844	eng	Should we come to Boston?
6268845	eng	Tom needs to show Mary how to do that.
6268846	eng	Tom says that he'll do that.
6268847	eng	Please tell us the truth.
6268848	eng	Tom likes swimming and Mary does, too.
6268849	eng	Tom says he's taught French.
6268850	eng	Please give me all those.
6268851	eng	Tom let Mary know that he had arrived.
6268852	eng	Tom says he's learned a lot.
6268853	eng	Please give me all these.
6268854	eng	Tom knows that Mary shouldn't do that.
6268855	eng	Tom says he's good at chess.
6268856	eng	Please don't do that now.
6268857	eng	Tom knew Mary was supposed to do that.
6268858	eng	Tom says he'll do just that.
6268859	eng	Please do that right now.
6268860	eng	Tom killed himself after killing Mary.
6268861	eng	Tom says he'd never do that.
6268862	eng	Please do that once more.
6268863	eng	Tom isn't as old as Mary thinks he is.
6268864	eng	Tom says he used to do that.
6268865	eng	Please do that next week.
6268866	eng	Tom is still touring with Mary's band.
6268867	eng	Tom says he doesn't do that.
6268868	eng	Please do that carefully.
6268869	eng	Tom is determined to do that for Mary.
6268870	eng	Tom says I ought to do that.
6268871	eng	Our troubles aren't over.
6268872	eng	Tom is better at doing that than Mary.
6268873	eng	Tom said the picnic was fun.
6268874	eng	Our problems aren't over.
6268875	eng	Tom is afraid that Mary might do that.
6268876	eng	Tom said that he was sleepy.
6268877	eng	Open the package, please.
6268878	eng	Tom helped Mary deal with the problem.
6268879	eng	Tom said his team would win.
6268880	eng	Only two people did that.
6268881	eng	Tom has told Mary to leave John alone.
6268882	eng	Tom said he's ready to help.
6268883	eng	One of us should do that.
6268884	eng	Tom has told Mary he needs to do that.
6268885	eng	Tom said he's in Boston now.
6268886	eng	One of us has to do that.
6268887	eng	Tom has been told to leave Mary alone.
6268888	eng	Tom said he's been forgiven.
6268889	eng	My time is very valuable.
6268890	eng	Tom has asked Mary to change her mind.
6268891	eng	Tom said he'll visit Boston.
6268892	eng	My strength is returning.
6268893	eng	Tom hardly ever talks to Mary anymore.
6268894	eng	Tom said he'll do that soon.
6268895	eng	My room isn't very large.
6268896	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she wanted.
6268897	eng	Tom said he'd fly to Boston.
6268898	eng	My room isn't very clean.
6268899	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she needed.
6268900	eng	Tom said he'd do that later.
6268901	eng	My room isn't like yours.
6268902	eng	Tom found Mary's purse under the sofa.
6268903	eng	Tom said he wasn't Canadian.
6268904	eng	My office is a real mess.
6268905	eng	Tom forgot to remind Mary to buy eggs.
6268906	eng	Tom said he was feeling bad.
6268907	eng	My name is on the ballot.
6268908	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was tired.
6268909	eng	Tom said he lost his temper.
6268910	eng	My house is easy to find.
6268911	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is hungry.
6268912	eng	Tom said he knows the rules.
6268913	eng	My friends laughed at me.
6268914	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like John.
6268915	eng	Tom said he knew what to do.
6268916	eng	My father was a preacher.
6268917	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be scared.
6268918	eng	Tom said he kept doing that.
6268919	eng	My father is very strict.
6268920	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be lonely.
6268921	eng	Tom said he did that for us.
6268922	eng	My efforts were rewarded.
6268923	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be afraid.
6268924	eng	Tom said I ought to do that.
6268925	eng	My dreams have come true.
6268926	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be absent.
6268927	eng	Tom said I looked terrified.
6268928	eng	My children love animals.
6268929	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is retired yet.
6268930	eng	Tom said I looked perplexed.
6268931	eng	My birthday is next week.
6268932	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is embarrassed.
6268933	eng	Tom said I looked horrified.
6268934	eng	Monday will be a hot day.
6268935	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is discouraged.
6268936	eng	Tom said I looked concerned.
6268937	eng	Mary has long brown hair.
6268938	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary has to do that.
6268940	eng	Make sure you're on time.
6268941	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary did that right.
6268942	eng	Tom said I had go to Boston.
6268943	eng	Look what I bought today.
6268944	eng	Tom doesn't like pizza, but Mary does.
6268945	eng	Tom refuses to speak French.
6268946	eng	Let's visit Boston first.
6268947	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't happy.
6268948	eng	Tom received a lot of gifts.
6268949	eng	Let's visit Boston again.
6268950	eng	Tom doesn't know who did that to Mary.
6268951	eng	Tom really wants to do that.
6268952	eng	Let's speak French today.
6268953	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is unhappy.
6268954	eng	Tom really tried to do that.
6268955	eng	Let's not stay in Boston.
6268956	eng	Tom doesn't know how Mary got injured.
6268957	eng	Tom really needs to do that.
6268958	eng	Let's go to Boston first.
6268959	eng	Tom doesn't expect Mary to be on time.
6268960	eng	Tom put the key on the desk.
6268961	eng	Let's go to Boston again.
6268962	eng	Tom doesn't blame Mary for doing that.
6268963	eng	Tom promised that he'd help.
6268964	eng	Let's get out of the way.
6268965	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary will do that.
6268966	eng	Tom promised that he'd come.
6268967	eng	Let's do that right away.
6268968	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was pretty.
6268969	eng	Tom promised that he'd call.
6268970	eng	Let's do that next month.
6268971	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was hungry.
6268972	eng	Tom promised he'll be there.
6268973	eng	Last month was very cold.
6268974	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be sleepy.
6268975	eng	Tom probably isn't busy now.
6268976	eng	It's way past my bedtime.
6268977	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be scared.
6268978	eng	Tom prefers to stay at home.
6268979	eng	It's very creepy in here.
6268980	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be lonely.
6268981	eng	Tom plays the clarinet well.
6268982	eng	It's too late to do that.
6268983	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be afraid.
6268984	eng	Tom plans to stay in Boston.
6268985	eng	It's our duty to do that.
6268986	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was retired yet.
6268987	eng	Tom plans to live in Boston.

6268989	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was embarrassed.
6268990	eng	Tom plans to come to Boston.
6268991	eng	It's not good to do that.
6268992	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was discouraged.
6268993	eng	Tom packed a large suitcase.
6268994	eng	It's humid now in Boston.
6268995	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was cooperative.
6268996	eng	Tom ought to stay in Boston.
6268997	eng	It's foggy now in Boston.
6268998	eng	Tom didn't like the way Mary did that.
6268999	eng	Tom ought to have done that.
6269000	eng	It's cold here in Boston.
6269001	eng	Tom didn't like any of Mary's friends.
6269002	eng	Tom often gets into trouble.
6269003	eng	It's almost time for bed.
6269004	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so upset.
6269005	eng	Tom never does that with us.
6269006	eng	It's a risk worth taking.
6269007	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so tired.
6269008	eng	Tom never actually did that.
6269009	eng	Is there any coffee left?
6269010	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was reading.
6269011	eng	Tom needs to stay in Boston.
6269012	eng	Is there any cheese left?
6269013	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wouldn't do that.
6269014	eng	Tom needs to be cooperative.
6269015	eng	Is it cold now in Boston?
6269016	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so tired.
6269017	eng	Tom must've wanted to speak.
6269018	eng	Is doing that prohibited?
6269019	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so happy.
6269020	eng	Tom must've been frustrated.
6269021	eng	I've visited Boston, too.
6269022	eng	Tom didn't even realize Mary had left.
6269023	eng	Tom must've been frightened.
6269024	eng	I've visited Boston once.
6269025	eng	Tom did that the way Mary told him to.
6269026	eng	Tom must've been astonished.
6269027	eng	I've studied French, too.
6269028	eng	Tom did that because Mary told him to.
6269029	eng	Tom must be in his thirties.
6269030	eng	I've seen people do that.
6269031	eng	Tom couldn't convince Mary to do that.
6269032	eng	Tom may speak French to you.
6269033	eng	I've never taught French.
6269034	eng	Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6269035	eng	Tom may have gone to Boston.
6269036	eng	I've left Boston already.
6269037	eng	Tom can swim at least as fast as Mary.
6269038	eng	Tom may do that if he wants.
6269039	eng	I've just visited Boston.
6269040	eng	Tom can do that much faster than Mary.
6269041	eng	Tom may do that if he likes.
6269042	eng	I've just read this book.
6269043	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that.
6269044	eng	Tom lost his job last month.
6269045	eng	I've just come to Boston.
6269046	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't do that.
6269047	eng	Tom lost his entire savings.
6269048	eng	I've got to take it easy.
6269049	eng	Tom asked Mary when the party started.
6269050	eng	Tom looked like he was busy.
6269051	eng	I've finished doing that.
6269052	eng	Tom asked Mary if she liked Thai food.

6269064	eng	Tom and Mary have something in common.
6269065	eng	Tom likely won't be nervous.
6269066	eng	I'm too tired to do that.

6269069	eng	I'm the person in charge.

6269071	eng	Tom knows a lot about birds.
6269072	eng	I'm smarter than you are.
6269073	eng	Tom and Mary aren't going to be there.
6269074	eng	Tom keeps his uniform clean.
6269075	eng	I'm quite good at tennis.
6269076	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting in the lobby.
6269077	eng	Tom just did that last week.
6269078	eng	I'm not leaving you guys.
6269079	eng	Tom and I invited Mary to our wedding.
6269080	eng	Tom isn't very conservative.

6269083	eng	Tom isn't the only survivor.
6269084	eng	I'm not having much luck.
6269085	eng	Tom advised Mary to get more exercise.
6269086	eng	Tom isn't really good to me.
6269087	eng	I'm not doing that again.

6269603	eng	I don't have that luxury.
6269604	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still here.
6269605	eng	Tom and I weren't impressed.
6269606	eng	I don't have much to say.
6269607	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still cold.
6269608	eng	Tom and I were also present.
6269609	eng	I don't have an umbrella.
6269610	eng	Tom said Mary is hesitant to do that.
6269611	eng	Tom and I want to come over.
6269612	eng	I don't eat pork anymore.
6269613	eng	Tom said Mary is grateful to be here.
6269614	eng	Tom and I texted each other.
6269615	eng	I don't eat meat or eggs.
6269616	eng	Tom said Mary is finished doing that.
6269617	eng	Tom and I talked about that.
6269618	eng	I don't eat meat anymore.
6269619	eng	Tom said Mary has to be more careful.
6269620	eng	Tom and I soon fell in love.
6269621	eng	I don't eat dill pickles.
6269622	eng	Tom said Mary has only met John once.
6269623	eng	Tom and I sat on the ground.
6269624	eng	I don't care about money.
6269625	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen his dog.
6269626	eng	Tom and I sat down together.
6269627	eng	I do that whenever I can.
6269628	eng	Tom said Mary has been robbed before.
6269629	eng	Tom and I meet every Monday.
6269630	eng	I didn't win the contest.
6269631	eng	Tom said Mary has been feeling tired.
6269632	eng	Tom and I hung out together.
6269633	eng	I didn't wash the dishes.
6269634	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to do that.
6269635	eng	Tom and I hugged and kissed.
6269636	eng	I didn't want to go home.
6269637	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound surprised.
6269638	eng	Tom and I haven't eaten yet.
6269639	eng	I didn't want to do this.
6269640	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound convinced.
6269641	eng	Tom and I have an agreement.
6269642	eng	I didn't want to be last.
6269643	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound confident.
6269644	eng	Tom and I have a nice house.
6269645	eng	I didn't want get caught.
6269646	eng	Tom said Mary didn't need to do that.
6269647	eng	Tom and I have a lot of fun.
6269648	eng	I didn't want a sandwich.
6269649	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to do that.
6269650	eng	Tom and I hang out together.
6269651	eng	I didn't try hard enough.
6269652	eng	Tom refused to tell me what Mary did.
6269653	eng	Tom and I first met in 2013.
6269654	eng	I didn't talk about that.
6269655	eng	Tom may not come to Boston with Mary.
6269656	eng	Tom and I exchanged glances.
6269657	eng	I didn't suspect a thing.
6269658	eng	Tom looked directly into Mary's eyes.
6269659	eng	Tom and I enjoyed ourselves.
6269660	eng	I didn't study yesterday.
6269661	eng	Tom likes the way Mary smiles at him.
6269662	eng	Tom and I do a lot together.
6269663	eng	I didn't stay there long.
6269664	eng	Tom knows why Mary wanted to do that.
6269665	eng	Tom and I did what we could.
6269666	eng	I didn't read the report.
6269667	eng	Tom knows that Mary wants to do that.
6269668	eng	Tom and I detest each other.
6269669	eng	I didn't like what I saw.
6269670	eng	Tom knows that Mary needs to do that.
6269671	eng	Tom and I ate lunch outside.
6269672	eng	I didn't like that place.
6269673	eng	Tom knows Mary will help him do that.
6269674	eng	Tom and I argue quite often.
6269675	eng	I didn't like that movie.
6269677	eng	Tom and I aren't happy here.
6269678	eng	I didn't like being poor.
6269679	eng	Tom knew Mary would help him do that.
6269680	eng	Tom and I are very busy now.
6269681	eng	I didn't know the system.
6269682	eng	Tom knew Mary didn't have to do that.
6269683	eng	Tom and I are still married.
6269684	eng	I didn't know about that.
6269685	eng	Tom isn't sure Mary needs to do that.
6269686	eng	Tom and I are still in love.
6269687	eng	I didn't keep my promise.
6269688	eng	Tom is very sure Mary should do that.
6269689	eng	Tom and I are playing poker.
6269690	eng	I didn't have permission.
6269691	eng	Tom is very sure Mary has to do that.
6269692	eng	Tom and I are playing chess.
6269693	eng	I didn't have a good day.
6269694	eng	Tom is very happy that Mary did that.
6269695	eng	Tom and I are playing cards.
6269696	eng	I didn't go to the party.
6269697	eng	Tom is reluctant to do that for Mary.
6269698	eng	Tom and I are in Boston now.
6269699	eng	I didn't go to the dance.
6269700	eng	Tom is doing that just to annoy Mary.
6269701	eng	Tom and I are house hunting.
6269702	eng	I didn't finish the race.
6269703	eng	Tom is convinced that Mary likes him.
6269704	eng	Tom and I are having a baby.
6269705	eng	I didn't feel threatened.
6269706	eng	Tom hopes Mary will teach him French.
6269707	eng	Tom and I are back together.
6269708	eng	I didn't exactly say yes.
6269709	eng	Tom hoped that Mary wouldn't do that.
6269710	eng	Tom and I already know that.
6269711	eng	I didn't do that, either.
6269713	eng	Tom always seems to do that.
6269714	eng	I didn't do that so well.
6269715	eng	Tom has told Mary she has to do that.
6269716	eng	Tom always seems to be sick.
6269717	eng	I didn't demand anything.
6269718	eng	Tom has found out Mary can't read.
6269719	eng	Tom always seems to be late.
6269720	eng	I didn't crack any jokes.
6269721	eng	Tom has done that more than Mary has.
6269722	eng	Tom always seems to be here.
6269723	eng	I didn't comment on that.
6269724	eng	Tom has already told Mary to do that.
6269725	eng	Tom always does that for us.
6269726	eng	I didn't call the police.
6269727	eng	Tom forgot to remind Mary to do that.
6269728	eng	Tom also did that yesterday.
6269729	eng	I didn't break any rules.
6269730	eng	Tom expected Mary to do things right.
6269731	eng	Tom admitted he's done that.
6269732	eng	I didn't approve of that.
6269733	eng	Tom drives as carefully as Mary does.
6269734	eng	Tom's eyes filled with tears.
6269735	eng	I didn't answer my phone.
6269736	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that for Mary.
6269737	eng	Tom wouldn't do that again.
6269739	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was busy.
6269740	eng	Tom works in a car factory.
6269741	eng	I did that for the money.
6269742	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is tired.
6269743	eng	Tom worked on the railroad.
6269744	eng	I did that for my family.
6269745	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is happy.
6269746	eng	Tom worked here until 2013.
6269747	eng	I decided not to do that.
6269748	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would do that.
6269749	eng	Tom won't make you do that.
6269750	eng	I could help you do that.
6269751	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be upset.
6269752	eng	Tom won't likely be sleepy.
6269753	eng	I could buy that for you.
6269754	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be ready.
6269755	eng	Tom won't likely be scared.
6269756	eng	I carried both suitcases.
6269757	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be first.
6269758	eng	Tom won't likely be lonely.
6269759	eng	I can't stand doing that.

6269764	eng	Tom won't likely be absent.
6269765	eng	I bought three notebooks.
6269766	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be alone.
6269767	eng	Tom won't buy that for you.
6269768	eng	I believe we can do that.

6269770	eng	Tom won't be here tomorrow.
6269772	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is frightened.
6269773	eng	Tom won't be busy tomorrow.
6269774	eng	I believe it can be done.
6269775	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is doing that.
6269776	eng	Tom will visit Boston soon.
6269777	eng	I always have to do that.
6269778	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary could do that.
6269779	eng	Tom will return after 2:30.
6269780	eng	I agreed to go to Boston.
6269781	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary dances.
6269782	eng	Tom will probably be upset.
6269783	eng	I agree that's a problem.
6269784	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary was born.
6269785	eng	Tom will probably be tired.
6269786	eng	How often do you do that?
6269787	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary is going.
6269788	eng	Tom will probably be ready.
6269789	eng	How do you open this box?
6269790	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is hungry.
6269791	eng	Tom will probably be early.
6269792	eng	How do you cook potatoes?
6269793	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary hates him.
6269794	eng	Tom will likely be pleased.
6269795	eng	How did you go to Boston?
6269796	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary didn't do that.
6269797	eng	Tom will likely be nervous.
6269798	eng	Have I ever deceived you?
6269799	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary can do that.
6269800	eng	Tom will likely be jealous.
6269801	eng	Don't try to do that now.
6269802	eng	Tom didn't want to help Mary do that.
6269803	eng	Tom will likely be furious.
6269804	eng	Don't scare me like that.
6269805	eng	Tom didn't want to be on Mary's team.
6269806	eng	Tom will likely be curious.
6269807	eng	Don't park your car here.
6269808	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was tired.
6269809	eng	Tom will be there for sure.
6269810	eng	Don't be late for dinner.
6269811	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was happy.
6269812	eng	Tom will be home on Monday.
6269813	eng	Doing that's a good idea.
6269814	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be tired.
6269815	eng	Tom went down to the beach.
6269816	eng	Doing that would be rude.
6269817	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be ready.
6269818	eng	Tom wasn't very suspicious.
6269819	eng	Doing that would be easy.
6269820	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be first.
6269821	eng	Tom wasn't very supportive.
6269822	eng	Doing that was very easy.
6269823	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be early.
6269824	eng	Tom wasn't very reasonable.
6269825	eng	Doing that should be fun.
6269826	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be alone.
6269827	eng	Tom wasn't very optimistic.
6269828	eng	Do you want to come, too?

6269837	eng	Do you intend to do that?
6269838	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was frightened.
6269839	eng	Tom was wearing a new coat.
6269840	eng	Do you have dental floss?
6269841	eng	Tom didn't think Mary looked nervous.
6269842	eng	Tom was too shy to do that.
6269843	eng	Do you ever visit Boston?
6269844	eng	Tom didn't tell me Mary was his wife.
6269845	eng	Tom was tempted to do that.
6269846	eng	Do you do that every day?
6269847	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he did that.
6269848	eng	Tom was polite but distant.
6269849	eng	Do I have to wear a suit?
6269850	eng	Tom didn't seem to know who Mary was.
6269851	eng	Tom was ordered to do that.
6269852	eng	Did you say you did that?
6269853	eng	Tom didn't really give Mary a chance.
6269854	eng	Tom was never my boyfriend.
6269855	eng	Chuck's Diner has closed.
6269856	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so busy.
6269857	eng	Tom was in court on Monday.
6269858	eng	Can you do that tomorrow?
6269859	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was going.
6269860	eng	Tom was fascinated by that.
6269861	eng	Can I come with a friend?
6269862	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so busy.
6269863	eng	Tom was enjoying the party.
6269864	eng	Aren't you satisfied yet?
6269865	eng	Tom did what he could to rescue Mary.
6269866	eng	Tom was a railway employee.
6269867	eng	Are you happy to do that?

6269884	eng	Tom used to be my neighbor.
6269885	eng	Your reputation is good.
6269886	eng	Tom asked Mary why she was in Boston.
6269887	eng	Tom tried to drown himself.
6269888	eng	Your name's on the list.
6269889	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had been late.
6269890	eng	Tom told me that he's well.
6269891	eng	Your answer was correct.
6269892	eng	Tom asked Mary why he had to do that.
6269893	eng	Tom told me that he's safe.
6269894	eng	You've been blacklisted.
6269895	eng	Tom asked Mary to do that by herself.
6269896	eng	Tom told me that he's last.
6269897	eng	You're the only witness.
6269898	eng	Tom asked Mary if she had to do that.
6269899	eng	Tom told me that he's fine.
6269900	eng	You're a very smart guy.

6269908	eng	Tom told me that I'm right.
6269909	eng	You're a very good cook.
6269910	eng	Tom and Mary live and work in Boston.
6269911	eng	Tom told me that I'm pushy.
6269912	eng	You're a terrible coach.
6269913	eng	Tom and Mary aren't going to help us.
6269914	eng	Tom told me that I'm first.
6269915	eng	You're a strange person.
6269916	eng	Tom and Mary aren't going to do that.
6269917	eng	Tom thinks he's infallible.
6269918	eng	You're a selfish person.
6269919	eng	Tom and Mary are unlikely to do that.
6269920	eng	Tom teaches at this school.
6269921	eng	You're a natural leader.
6269922	eng	Tom and Mary are an interesting pair.
6269923	eng	Tom still wants to do that.
6269924	eng	You're a likable person.

6269932	eng	Tom shouted that he was OK.
6269933	eng	You're a good carpenter.
6269934	eng	Tom and I couldn't help Mary do that.
6269935	eng	Tom shouldn't do that here.
6269936	eng	You're a fantastic cook.
6269937	eng	Perhaps Tom went to Boston with Mary.
6269938	eng	Tom shouldn't be in Boston.
6269939	eng	You're a bright student.
6269940	eng	I'm not going to Tom and Mary's wedding.
6269941	eng	Tom should've left earlier.
6269942	eng	You're a bad role model.
6269943	eng	I shouldn't have told Tom about Mary.
6269944	eng	Tom should've been with us.
6269945	eng	You'll hurry, won't you?
6269946	eng	I don't want Tom to see Mary anymore.
6269948	eng	You were polite, I hope.
6269949	eng	I don't think Tom is as rich as Mary.
6269950	eng	Tom should've been excited.
6269951	eng	You want one, don't you?
6269952	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my sister.
6269953	eng	Tom should've been careful.
6269954	eng	You swore you'd do that.
6269955	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my cousin.
6269956	eng	Tom should stop doing that.
6269957	eng	You sure do whine a lot.
6269958	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's uncle?
6269959	eng	Tom should do that himself.
6269960	eng	You sure do sweat a lot.
6269961	eng	Did you know Tom was older than Mary?
6269962	eng	Tom should be awake by now.
6269963	eng	You sure do swear a lot.
6269964	eng	Did you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
6269965	eng	Tom seldom comes to Boston.
6269966	eng	You sure do smoke a lot.
6269967	eng	Ask Tom if he knows where Mary lives.
6269968	eng	Tom seems to be very upset.
6269969	eng	You sure do laugh a lot.
6269970	eng	Tom wouldn't permit Mary to do that.
6269971	eng	Tom seems to be very tired.
6269972	eng	You should leave Boston.
6269973	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was so grumpy.
6269974	eng	Tom seems to be very angry.
6269975	eng	You should go to Boston.
6269976	eng	Tom wondered what Mary wanted to do.

6269978	eng	You seemed to be lonely.
6269979	eng	Tom wondered what Mary needed to do.
6269980	eng	Tom seemed to be very busy.
6269981	eng	You really impressed us.
6269982	eng	Tom won't like it if Mary does that.
6269983	eng	Tom says that he does that.
6269984	eng	You really impressed me.
6269985	eng	Tom will do that with Mary tomorrow.
6269986	eng	Tom says he's lost his key.
6269987	eng	You never smile anymore.
6269988	eng	Tom will be upset if Mary does that.
6269989	eng	Tom says he should do that.
6269990	eng	You never laugh anymore.
6269991	eng	Tom went to ask Mary not to do that.

6277983	ukr	Гадаю, Том та Мері не знають одне одного.
6277984	ukr	Я не думаю, що тобі слід йти туди з Томом.
6277985	ukr	Не думаю, що вам слід їхати туди з Томом.
6277986	ukr	Я не знаю нікого з учителів Тома.
6277987	ukr	Думаєш, Том зробив би це таким чином?
6277988	ukr	Думаєте, Том зробив би це таким чином?
6277989	ukr	Думаєш, Том колись сюди повернеться?
6277990	ukr	Думаєте, Том колись сюди повернеться?
6277991	ukr	Том швидко зрозумів, що він не сам.
6277992	ukr	Том знав, що він навряд чи запізниться.
6277993	ukr	Том знав, що його заарештують.
6277994	ukr	Том знав, що у двері стукала Мері.
6277995	ukr	Том сьогодні у чорному пальто.
6277996	ukr	Том сьогодні у чорній куртці.
6277997	ukr	Том прийде з нами жити.
6277998	ukr	Том весь день плаче.
6277999	ukr	Том не дозволив Мері вести його машину.
6278000	ukr	Том стверджує, що він навіть ніколи не говорив з Мері.
6278001	ukr	Том не знав, де працює Мері.
6278002	ukr	Том запитав нас, в яких музеях ми були.
6278003	ukr	Том любить багато чого робити.
6278004	ukr	Том та Мері завжди були разом.
6278005	ukr	Я б хотів знати, чому Том нам не допомагає.
6278006	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, чому Том нам не допомагає.
6278007	ukr	Скажи Тому, що я йду з Мері.
6278008	ukr	Скажіть Тому, що я йду з Мері.
6278009	ukr	Я певен, що Том не брехав би Мері.
6278010	ukr	Я певна, що Том не брехав би Мері.
6278011	ukr	Які книжки любить читати Том?
6278012	ukr	Дуже шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб нам допомогти.
6278013	ukr	Саме Том розповів про це Мері.
6278014	ukr	Я думаю, Тому би це дуже сподобалося.
6278015	ukr	Том хотів знати, хто батько Мері.
6278017	ukr	Том думав, що план Мері не дуже добрий.
6278018	ukr	Я думаю, що знаю, що сказав би Том.
6278019	ukr	Гадаю, що знаю, що сказав би Том.
6278020	ukr	Чому Тому слід це робити, якщо він цього робити не зобов'язаний?
6278021	ukr	Чому Том думає, що зробти це було доброю ідеєю?
6278022	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том ніколи цього не робив?
6278023	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том ніколи цього не робив?
6278024	ukr	Я не вірю тому, що сказав мені Том.
6278025	ukr	Те, що ми з Томом зробили того дня, неможливо пробачити.
6278026	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері не робити цього.
6278027	ukr	Том ніколи не зможе зробити цього один.
6278028	ukr	Том сказав про Мері жахливі речі.
6278029	ukr	Том допоможе тобі це зробити, якщо хочеш.
6278030	ukr	Том допоможе вам це зробити, якщо хочеш.
6278031	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше, коли він буде не такий зайнятий.
6278032	ukr	Це зробив не Том. Це була Мері.
6278033	ukr	Том сказав мені, де він планував це робити.
6278034	ukr	Тому слід сказати Мері, що вона повинна це зробити.
6278035	ukr	Том сказав, що пам'ятає, що попросив Мері це зробити.
6278036	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібний спеціальний інструмент, щоб це зробити.
6278037	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері хоче це зробити.
6278038	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері потрібно це зробити.
6278039	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що я цього не робитиму.
6278040	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері небагато грошей.
6278041	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278042	ukr	Я хотіла сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278043	ukr	Том не дуже добре грає на піаніно.
6278044	ukr	Я думав, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278045	ukr	Я гадала, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278046	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати Мері зробити це.
6278047	ukr	Том ніколи не дізнається, хто це зробив.
6278048	ukr	Том запитає Мері, чи вона може це зробити.
6278049	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж Мері.
6278050	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж я.
6278051	ukr	Том придумав цікавий спосіб, як це зробити.
6278052	ukr	Том, здається, не поспішав цього робити.
6278053	ukr	Том не знав, що він має допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278054	ukr	Том та Мері були перші, хто це зробив.
6278055	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про тебе не розповідав.
6278056	ukr	Том та Мері завжди роблять це разом.
6278057	ukr	Том вже знає, чому Мері хоче це зробити.
6278058	ukr	Якщо ти розповіш Тому, як це зробити, він це зробить.
6278059	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає, як це зробити.
6278060	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає спосіб, як це зробити.
6278061	ukr	Я не певен, чи може це Том зробити, чи ні.
6278062	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том запропонував нам це зробити сьогодні.
6278063	ukr	Цікаво, скільки людей бачило, як Том це робив.
6278064	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не проситиме мене робити це.
6278065	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не проситиме мене зробити це.
6278066	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері полетіла на дельтаплані.
6278067	ukr	Я думав, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278068	ukr	Я гадала, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278069	ukr	Я думаю, що саме Том сказав Мері це зробити.
6278070	ukr	Я думаю, Том, можливо, зможе це зробити для Мері.
6278271	ukr	Я думаю, що Том планує зробити це завтра.
6278272	ukr	Том знав, що він вже не потрібний.
6278273	ukr	Я думаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278274	ukr	Гадаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278275	ukr	Я не мав уяви, що Том буде це робити.
6278276	ukr	Я не мала поняття, що Том буде це робити.
6278277	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том колись припинить це робити.
6278278	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь перестане це робити.
6278279	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це колись робив.
6278280	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь це робив.
6278281	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том міг би переконати Мері це зробити.
6278282	ukr	Не думаю, що Том зміг переконати Мері це зробити.
6278283	ukr	Я не знаю, чи Том хое це робити, чи ні.
6278284	ukr	Я не знав, що Том це робитиме.
6278285	ukr	Я не знала, що Том це робитиме.
6278286	ukr	Хіба ти не питав Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278287	ukr	Хіба ти не запитала Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278288	ukr	Ти б сказав Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278289	ukr	Ти не міг би сказати Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278290	ukr	Навіщо Тому знадобилася би Мері, щоб це для нього зробити?
6278291	ukr	Чому Тому треба просити Мері це для нього зробити?
6278292	ukr	З якого дива Том хотів би це зробити?
6278293	ukr	Чому Том хоче марнувати на це час?
6278294	ukr	Том щойно втік із в'язниці.
6278295	ukr	Чому, на твою думку, Тому робитиме це?
6278296	ukr	Гадаю, Тома сьогодні тут не буде.
6278297	ukr	Тому було насправді необхідно це робити?
6278298	ukr	Том спробує дізнатися, чому Мері це зробила.
6278299	ukr	Том, можливо, зазнає травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278300	ukr	Том, імовірно, придумає, як це зробити.
6278301	ukr	Том ніколи за це не пробачить Мері.
6278302	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, там буде?
6278303	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей анекдот, ніхто не засміявся.
6278304	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей жарт, ніхто не засміявся.
6278305	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Тома там не буде?
6278306	ukr	Чому ви вважаєте, що Тома там не буде?
6278307	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще на столі.
6278308	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще лежать на столі.
6278309	ukr	Том був на вечірці до самого кінця.
6278310	ukr	Том думав, що у Мері доволі непоганий план.
6278311	ukr	Тому слід було сказати мені про це раніше.
6278312	ukr	У Тома не було достатньо сил, щоб зробити це.
6278313	ukr	Тому слід було бути ввічливішим.
6278314	ukr	Тому слід було бути більш чемним.
6278315	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати про це Мері.
6278316	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув розповісти про це Мері.
6278317	ukr	Том щойно розповів мені, що треба було зробити.
6278318	ukr	Том просто розповів мені, що треба зробити.
6278319	ukr	Я думаю, Том цього теж не робитиме.
6278320	ukr	Навряд чи Том буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278321	ukr	Том готується до важливої події.
6278322	ukr	У лівій руці Том тримає ніж.
6278323	ukr	Том вирішив не ставати вчителем.
6278324	ukr	Що у той час робив Том?
6278325	ukr	Том весь час носить з собою зброю.
6278326	ukr	Дуже малоймовірно, що Том це зробить коли-небудь ще раз.
6278327	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язаний цього робити.
6278328	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язана цього робити.
6278329	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це сьогодні.
6278330	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278331	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує зробити Мері.
6278332	ukr	Є багато всього, чого Том не їстиме.
6278333	ukr	Тому насправді слід це робити просто зараз.
6278334	ukr	Том не натякає на те, що це зробила Мері, чи не так?
6278335	ukr	Я певен, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278336	ukr	Я певна, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278337	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278338	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робити.
6278339	ukr	Я думав, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278340	ukr	Я думала, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278341	ukr	Думаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278342	ukr	Гадаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278343	ukr	Том вирішив ніколи більше цього не робити.
6278344	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тома не муситиме сидіти у в'язниці.
6278345	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросив.
6278346	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросила.
6278347	ukr	Том весь ранок провів у ліжку.
6278348	ukr	Том не розумів, що Мері не повинна цього робити.
6278349	ukr	Том не купив усе, що хотів.
6278350	ukr	Ти чув, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278351	ukr	Ти чула, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278352	ukr	Усі подумали, що Том канадієць.
6278353	ukr	Будь ласка, покажи Тому, як це робиться.
6278354	ukr	Будь ласка, покажіть Тому, як це зробити.
6278355	ukr	Я певен, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278356	ukr	Я певна, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278357	ukr	Мені цікаво, чому Том не отримує від цього задоволення.
6278358	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ти його попросиш.
6278359	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ви його попросите.
6278360	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том планував це зробити.
6278361	ukr	Тому хотів би, щоб у нього було більше друзів.
6278362	ukr	Думаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278363	ukr	Гадаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278364	ukr	Том думав, що, можливо, сталося щось погане.
6278365	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це робитиме ще.
6278366	ukr	Думаєш, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278367	ukr	Гадаєте, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278368	ukr	Том увесь час плакав.
6278369	ukr	Том спить зі зброєю під подушкою.
6278370	ukr	Тому слід було б більше допомагати Мері.
6278371	ukr	Шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб це зробити.
6278372	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері зробити це.
6278373	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи спізниться.
6278374	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері недостатньо грошей.
6278375	ukr	Том намагається познайомитися з новими друзями.
6278376	ukr	Тома звільнять, якщо він цього не зробить.
6278377	ukr	Том читає детектив.
6278378	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти йому за це заплатиш.
6278379	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви йому за це заплатите.
6278380	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти його ввічливо попросиш.
6278381	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви його ввічливо попросите.
6278382	ukr	Звичайно ж Том спробує це зробити сьогодні.
6278383	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникам усе, що у нього було.
6278384	ukr	Том сказав, що ніколи не сказав би Мері цього робити.
6278385	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволив цього робити.
6278386	ukr	Том сказав, що з радістю це для тебе зробить.
6278387	ukr	Том зрозумів, що має допомогти Мері це зробити.
6278388	ukr	Том не знав, хто чоловік Мері.
6278389	ukr	Я чекаю, щоб Том пішов.
6278390	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я більше цього не робитиму.
6278391	ukr	Том та Мері разом пішли до тогрівельного центру.
6278392	ukr	Том та Мері колись ігнорували одне одного.
6278393	ukr	Малоймовірно, що Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278394	ukr	Це самий останній лист, написаний Томом.
6278395	ukr	Том єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6278396	ukr	Том все ще не дуже добре вміє це робити.
6278397	ukr	Саме це врешті-решт зробив Том.
6278398	ukr	Том не зміг би цього зробити без допомоги.
6278399	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не купуватиме цієї машини.
6278400	ukr	Це я переконав Тома зробити це.
6278401	ukr	Це я переконала Тома зробити це.
6278402	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278403	ukr	Я певна, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278404	ukr	Том чув якісь дивні звуки.
6278405	ukr	Том почув якісь дивні звуки.
6278406	ukr	Я попрошу Тома показати Мері, як це зробити.
6278407	ukr	Я попрошу Тома переконатися в тому, що Мері це робитиме.
6278408	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том планував це зробити.
6278409	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том хотів, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278410	ukr	Том дав Мері ще трохи грошей.
6278411	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278412	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278413	ukr	Я сподіваюся, що Том зробив те, про що ми його попросили.
6278414	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що тобі не сподобається це робити.
6278415	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що вам не сподобається це робити.
6278416	ukr	Я думав, що Том, ймовірно, це зробить.
6278417	ukr	Я все ще відповідаю за Тома.
6278418	ukr	Я думаю, ось чому том хотів це зробити.
6278419	ukr	Думаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278420	ukr	Гадаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278421	ukr	З ким Том планував поїхати до Бостона?
6278422	ukr	Думаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278423	ukr	Гадаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278424	ukr	Том говорив по телефону.
6278425	ukr	Том балакав по телефону.
6278426	ukr	Я не думаю, що Тому сподобалося би це робити.
6278427	ukr	Тому було лячно йти на вулицю.
6278428	ukr	Тому було лячно йти надвір.
6278429	ukr	Думаєш, Том це коли-небудь буде робити?
6278430	ukr	Том зробить все, що необхідно зробити.
6278431	ukr	Ніхто не заперечує, якщо Том це зробить?
6278432	ukr	Том спробував закінчити те, що він робив.
6278433	ukr	Том намагався закінчити те, що він робив.
6278434	ukr	Чому ми з Томом не робимо цього зараз?
6278435	ukr	Коли Том показав тобі, як це робиться?
6278436	ukr	Коли Том показав вам, як це робиться?
6278437	ukr	Що б ти не робив, не роби цього з Томом.
6278438	ukr	Що б ти не робила, не роби цього з Томом.
6278439	ukr	Том сказав Мері жахливі речі.
6278440	ukr	Том сказав, що він починає втомлюватися.
6278441	ukr	Том вдягнений відповідно до ситуації.
6278442	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері його поцілує.
6278443	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може завдати йому біль.
6278444	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може зробити йому боляче.
6278445	ukr	У Тома були проблеми в школі.
6278446	ukr	Тому буде потрібно зробити це в якомусь іншому місці.
6278447	ukr	Том знав, що Мере не з Бостона.
6278448	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи відмовиться.
6278449	ukr	Том однозначно цього більше не робитиме.
6278450	ukr	Том хотів зупинити Мері від того, щоб вона це зробила.
6278451	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що вона має це зробити.
6278452	ukr	Том наймолодший з трьох братів.
6278453	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що мона може це зробити.
6278454	ukr	Том наполегливо радив не робити цього.
6278455	ukr	Том сказав, що він все ще не готовий це робити.
6278456	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потбрібно допомоги Мері зробити це.
6278457	ukr	Том знає, що він цього аж ніяк не може зробити.
6278458	ukr	Том уяви не мав, що відбувалося.
6278459	ukr	Том знайшов няню для своїх дітей.
6278460	ukr	У Тома не було у Бостоні жодних друзів.
6278461	ukr	Том намагається не чхнути.
6278462	ukr	Том не вірив нічому, що говорила Мері.
6278463	ukr	Том не повірив ні у що, що розповіла Мері.
6278464	ukr	Том побачить, чи Мері зможе це зробити.
6278465	ukr	Том не зміг відчинити двері шафи.
6278466	ukr	Це не дуже добра ідея дозволити Тому зробити це.
6278467	ukr	У Тома завжди з собою його губна гармоніка.
6278468	ukr	Я повинен зараз допомагати Тому.
6278469	ukr	Я повинна зараз допомагати Тому.
6278470	ukr	Я б хотів знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278471	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278472	ukr	Том не це планує зробити.
6278473	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що ти не захочеш цього робити.
6278474	ukr	Я сказала Тому, що ви не захочете цього робити.
6278475	ukr	Я думав, що побачу тут Тома.
6278476	ukr	Я думала, що побачу тут Тома.
6278477	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278478	ukr	Я думала, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278479	ukr	У Тома все ще є що робити.
6278480	ukr	Я думаю, Том робив це одного разу чи двічі.
6278481	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том матимеме щось проти того, щоб це зробити.
6278482	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш знати, як Том це зробив?
6278483	ukr	Хіба ви не хочете знати, як Том це зробив?
6278484	ukr	Ти коли-небудь запитував Тома, як він це зробив?
6278485	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом приблизно не одного віку?
6278486	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом не ровесники?
6278487	ukr	Думаєш, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278488	ukr	Думаєте, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278489	ukr	Том і насправді зробив це без будь-якої допомоги?
6278490	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278491	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278492	ukr	Будинок Тома був дуже гарний.
6278493	ukr	Том був переляканий, і я також.
6278494	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що треба зробити.
6278495	ukr	Том розповів Мері про те, що він зробив.
6278496	ukr	Том зможе це зробити один.
6278497	ukr	Це Том сказав мені це зробити.
6278498	ukr	Тому насправді варто було поснідати.
6278499	ukr	Том зрозумів, що був лише один вихід.
6278500	ukr	Том зрозумів, що він більше не потрібен.
6278501	ukr	Том лише учора ввечері зробив Мері пропозицію.
6278502	ukr	Том повинен був сказати Мері не робити цього.
6278503	ukr	Том грав у комп'ютерні ігри весь день.
6278504	ukr	Том каже, що хоче допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278505	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про вас не розповідав.
6278506	ukr	Том каже, що ще не готовий цього робити.
6278507	ukr	Том знав більше, ніж казав.
6278508	ukr	Том сказав, що йому краще це зробити наступного тижня.
6278509	ukr	Том сказав, що він би хотів, щоб це зробила Мері.
6278510	ukr	Том сказав, що більше ніколи цього не робитиме.
6278511	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде голодна.
6278512	ukr	Том сказав, що немає поспіху у тому, що він робить.
6278513	ukr	Том щойно зателефонував мені кілька хвилин тому.
6278514	ukr	Том не прийде жити з нами.
6278515	ukr	Том сказав, що не може втриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6278516	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат.
6278517	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат-латук.
6278518	ukr	Том купив те, що хотів.
6278519	ukr	Том, імовірно, буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278520	ukr	Том завжди робить все, що може.
6278521	ukr	Том у своїй кімнаті, переодягається.
6278522	ukr	Кого хотів найняти Том?
6278523	ukr	Тому сподобається в Бостоні.
6278734	eng	Tom knew that Mary was likely to not be busy.
6278824	ukr	Том весь вечір дивиться телевізор.
6278825	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно зробити.
6278826	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно робити.
6278827	ukr	Том зараз, мабуть, зайнятий.
6278828	ukr	Том однозначно наляканий.
6278829	ukr	Немає сумніву, що Том переляканий.
6278830	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали зробити.
6278831	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали.
6278832	ukr	Я уяви не мав, що Том це робитиме.
6278833	ukr	Я уяви не мала, що Том це робитиме.
6278834	ukr	Том запевнив мене, що пістолет незаряджений.
6278835	ukr	Яким чином ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278836	ukr	Як ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278837	ukr	Том вийшов з води.
6278838	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб Том це для тебе зробив?
6278839	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб це для тебе зробив Том?
6278840	ukr	Том погодився зустріти Мері після школи.
6278841	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно допомогти Тому.
6278842	ukr	Я думав, що Мері сподобається Тому.
6278843	ukr	Я думаю, тобі слід піти туди з Томом.
6278844	ukr	Я думаю, вам слід піти туди з Томом.
6278845	ukr	Я думаю, що Том минулого тижня їздив до Бостона.
6278846	ukr	Я думаю, Том казав неправду.
6278847	ukr	Я думаю, Том сказав нам неправду.
6278848	ukr	Тому не дозволять це знову зробити.
6278849	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше сьогодні вдень.
6278850	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо Мері захоче, щоб він це зробив.
6278851	ukr	Том знову здоровий.
6278852	ukr	Том намагався це зробити, але не зміг.
6278853	ukr	Том чмокнув Мері й сів у автобус.
6278854	ukr	Том не пам'ятає нічого з тієї ночі.
6278855	ukr	Том сказав, що він би краще цього тут не робив.
6278856	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері варить спагеті.
6278857	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері робить спагеті.
6278858	ukr	Мікроавтобус Тома припаркований біля будинку.
6278859	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж зробить це.
6278860	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж робитиме це.
6278861	ukr	Том чув, як Мері кричала.
6278862	ukr	У Тома недостатньо грошей, щоб купити квиток.
6278863	ukr	Том сказав, що він не бажає цього робити.
6278864	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері їхала з ним до Бостона.
6278865	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері поїхала з ним до Бостона.
6278866	ukr	Том не зрозумів, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278867	ukr	Том не усвідомлював, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278868	ukr	Том може зазнати травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278869	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня.
6278870	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня жінка.
6278871	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері сиділа.
6278872	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері ніколи не була в Бостоні.
6278873	ukr	Том завжди має при собі губну гармоніку.
6278874	ukr	Том був на балконі.
6278875	ukr	Том та Мері того ранку грали у теніс.
6278876	ukr	Том та Мері хотіли провести весь день разом.
6278877	ukr	Том та Мері колись все робили разом.
6278878	ukr	Тому має це зробити сам.
6278879	ukr	Том та Мері балакали до 2:30 ночі.
6278880	ukr	Том та Мері розмовляли до 2:30 ночі.
6278881	ukr	Том та Мері балакали про всяке-різне.

6278883	ukr	Том уже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278884	ukr	Том завжди йде спати до полуночі.
6278885	ukr	У поліції більше немає улік проти Тома.
6278886	ukr	У поліції немає жодних інших улік проти Тома.
6278887	ukr	Єдине ліжко, у якому Том коли-небудь спав, — це його власне.
6278888	ukr	Ніхто точно не знає, куди піде Том.
6278889	ukr	Учора ввечері Том заснув раніше опівночі.
6278890	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти цього робити.
6278891	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти це зробити.
6278892	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче піти з нами риболовити.
6278893	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з тобою, ніж з Томом.
6278894	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з вами, ніж з Томом.
6278895	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів, щоб його кохали.
6278896	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів кохання.
6278897	ukr	Я думаю, Том може переконати Мері зробити це.
6278898	ukr	Цікаво, що надихнуло Тома написати цю пісню?
6278899	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278900	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278901	ukr	Том чув, як Мері хропіла.
6278902	ukr	Том чув хропіння Мері.
6278903	ukr	Я думав, що Том скаже мені, що робити.
6278904	ukr	Я гадала, що Том скаже мені, що робити.
6278905	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросив.
6278906	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросила.
6278907	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що його попросила Мері.
6278908	ukr	Том був, мабуть, дуже втомлений, коли він прийшов додому.
6278909	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно щось купити Мері.
6278910	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно купити Мері квіти.
6278911	ukr	Чому Том вибачався?
6278912	ukr	Чому Том вибачився?
6278913	ukr	Можна попросити Тома це зробити?
6278914	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278915	ukr	Том усвідомив, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278916	ukr	Чому том не хоче, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278917	ukr	Том, мабуть, був дуже втомлений, коли прийшов додому.
6278918	ukr	Том зняв пальто.
6278919	ukr	Том зняв куртку.
6278920	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том може це зробити?
6278921	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том може це зробити?
6278922	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що ми його попросили.
6278923	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що його попросили.
6278924	ukr	Том би ніколи не сказав Мері зробити цього.
6278925	ukr	Том отримав певну кількість листів від Мері.
6278926	ukr	Том не знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278927	ukr	Том та Мері не танцювали одне з одним.
6278928	ukr	Том та Мері пішли до дорогого ресторану.
6278929	ukr	Том ніколи не дозволить, щоб ти це знову зробив.
6278930	ukr	Том ніколи не дозволить, щоб ти це знову зробила.
6278931	ukr	Тому потрібно було багато чого купити.
6278932	ukr	Том зробить це, коли буде його черга.
6278933	ukr	Том зробить це, коли настане його черга.
6278934	ukr	Єдина особа, з цим Том хоче говорити, — це Мері.
6278935	ukr	Єдина особа, про кого Том взагалі говорить, — це Мері.
6278936	ukr	Єдина книга, яку коли-небудь читав Том, — це Біблія.
6278937	ukr	Том чув гучний звук.
6278938	ukr	Том почув гучний звук.
6278939	ukr	Я думав, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278940	ukr	Я думала, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278941	ukr	Том сказав мені, що мені не слід цього робити.
6278942	ukr	Я думав, що Том дасть Мері квіти.
6278943	ukr	Я думав, що Том подарує Мері квіти.
6278944	ukr	Том зробить це знову.
6278945	ukr	Можеш зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278946	ukr	Можети зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278947	ukr	Спочатку Том думав, що Мері — сестра Джона.
6278948	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ти живеш.
6278949	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ви живете.
6278950	ukr	Том боявся йти до печери один.
6278951	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй це сказав.
6278952	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй про це розповів.
6278953	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволить Мері зробити це.
6278954	ukr	Тома заарештували, коли він перетинав кордон.
6278955	ukr	Том хотів, щоб Мері познайомилася з деякими з його друзів.
6278956	ukr	Том розповів Мері все, що вона хотіла знати.
6278957	ukr	Том гадав, що придумав добрий план.
6278958	ukr	Тому слід було подарувати Мері подарунок на день народження.
6278959	ukr	Том знає, що йому не слід цього знову робити.
6278960	ukr	Том сказав, що втомився й хоче додому.
6278961	ukr	Том сказав, що втомився і хоче піти додому.
6278962	ukr	Том знав, що мусить допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278963	ukr	Том прочитав всі книжки зі шкільної бібліотеки.
6278964	ukr	Том зараз знає правду про те, що сталося.
6278965	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це був не я.
6278966	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це була не я.
6278967	ukr	Том тепер знає правду про те, як померла Мері.
6278968	ukr	Том поїхав з Бостона за кілька днів до Різдва.
6278969	ukr	Том знав про Мері те, чого не знав Джон.
6278970	ukr	Я думаю, тому я й не люблю Тома.
6278971	ukr	Я думаю, тому мені й не подобається Том.
6278972	ukr	Том знав, що щось ось-ось трапиться.
6278973	ukr	Том знав, що щось ось-ось станеться.
6278974	ukr	Том знав, що ось-ось піде дощ.

6278976	ukr	Том знав, що його навряд чи оберуть.
6278977	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи зайнята.
6278978	ukr	Том знав, що може трапитися щось погане.
6278979	ukr	Том знав, що може статися щось погане.
6278980	ukr	Том — герой Мері.
6278981	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде в офісі.
6278982	ukr	Том все ще злиться?
6278983	ukr	Том добре вміє тримати речі на голові.
6278984	ukr	Том лише готується це зробити.
6278985	ukr	У Тома серйозні психологічні проблеми.
6278986	ukr	Том отримав багато листів від Мері.
6278987	ukr	Кого відвідав Том?
6278988	ukr	У кого був Том?
6278989	ukr	У Тома нещодавно було кілька поганих рішень.
6278990	ukr	Том нещодавно прийняв кілька поганих рішень.
6278991	ukr	Том весь рано грає на гітарі.
6278992	ukr	Тома не було у ліжку.
6278993	ukr	Том допомагає Мері зробити домашню роботу.
6278994	ukr	Том гадки не мав, що він занадто пронозливий.
6278995	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як і Мері.
6278996	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як Мері.
6278997	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він мав зробити.
6278998	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він повинен зробити.
6278999	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникав усе, що вони хотіли.
6279000	ukr	Том поцілував Мері та вийшов з машини.
6279001	ukr	Том дізнався, що Мері заміжня.
6279002	ukr	Том не знає, як вибачитися французькою.
6279003	ukr	Том не знає, як вибачатися французькою.
6279004	ukr	Ось ці належать Тому.
6279005	ukr	Вони належать Тому.
6279006	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб його бачили з Мері.
6279007	ukr	Все, що хотів Том, — трохи вільного часу.
6279008	ukr	Том ще не знав, що робитиме.
6279009	ukr	Кожного дня Том відвозить дітей до школи.
6279010	ukr	У Тома було набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279011	ukr	У Тома набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279012	ukr	Том одягнув окуляри.
6279013	ukr	Дмаю, Том зробить це знову.
6279014	ukr	Коли Том приїхав, поліція була вже на місці.
6279015	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том зробив це правильно.
6279016	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону зробити це.
6279017	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону це зробити.
6279018	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279019	ukr	Том та Мері не могли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279020	ukr	Я туди не піду.
6279021	ukr	Том не злитиметься, якщо Мері це зробить.
6279022	ukr	Том не планує насправді цього робити, чи не так?
6279023	ukr	Том же не планує насправді цього робити?
6279024	ukr	Я тут не лишуся.
6279025	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, буде готувати йому вечерю?
6279026	ukr	Том не єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6279027	ukr	Гадаєш, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279028	ukr	Ви думаєте, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279029	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я ніколи більше цього не робитиму.
6279030	ukr	Кого ти відвідав?
6279031	ukr	У кого ти був?
6279032	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже не потрібно це робити.
6279033	ukr	Гадаю, мені не варто було говорити Тому про це.
6279034	ukr	Чому ти голий?
6279035	ukr	Чому ти гола?
6279036	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це один.
6279037	ukr	Думаю, Том набагато краще від тебе плаває.
6279038	ukr	Гадаю, Том набагато краще від вас плаває.
6279039	ukr	Том каже, що зробить це, якщо цього захоче Мері.
6279040	ukr	Я думав, ще може бути зарано, щоб зайти до Тома.
6279041	ukr	Я живу у гуртожитку.
6279042	ukr	Том думає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не зробить.
6279043	ukr	Том гадає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не робитиме.
6279044	ukr	Я думав, що Ти знаєш, що Том та Мері одружені.
6279045	ukr	Том спробував зробити це, але не зміг.
6279046	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене йому допомагати.
6279047	ukr	Том зробить це першим ділом вранці.
6279048	ukr	Мері була першою дівчиною, яку Том коли-небудь кохав.
6279049	ukr	Том зробить це для тебе, якщо захочеш.
6279050	ukr	Том зробить це для вас, якщо захочете.
6279051	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуй умовити Тома приєднатися до нашої команди.
6279052	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуйте умовити Тома вступити до нашої команди.
6279053	ukr	Я зробив тобі чаю.
6279054	ukr	Я зробила вам чаю.
6279055	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ви цього не зробите сьогодні.
6279056	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ти цього не зробиш сьогодні.
6279057	ukr	Том та Мері сперечаються весь день.
6279058	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том це коли-небудь робитиме?
6279059	ukr	Я сьогодні багато працював.
6279060	ukr	Том та Мері говорили про всяке-різне.
6279061	ukr	Чому Том зробив це — поза моїм розумінням.
6279062	ukr	Том та Мері колись співали разом у клубі.
6279063	ukr	Чому Тому потрібна Мері, щоб зробити це для нього?
6279064	ukr	Том спалив усі листи, які надіслала йому Мері.
6279065	ukr	Я маю йти додому.
6279066	ukr	Мушу вже йти додому.
6279067	ukr	Чому б Том робив це, якщо він не має цього робити?
6279068	ukr	Ти не міг би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279069	ukr	Ви не могли би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279070	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері гадає, що йому треба піти.
6279071	ukr	Ти б знав, якби Тому можна було це зробити?
6279072	ukr	Ти б знала, якби Тому можна було це робити?
6279073	ukr	Ми балакали годинами.
6279074	ukr	Ми говорили годинами.
6279075	ukr	Думаєш, Том не заперечував би проти того, щоб Мері це зробила?
6279076	ukr	Том забув купити те, про що його попросила Мері.
6279077	ukr	Ти мене пробачиш?
6279078	ukr	Ви мене пробачите?
6279079	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том коли-небудь почне це робити.
6279080	ukr	Том не повернеться, щоб забрати Мері.
6279081	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ти це зробив.
6279082	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ви це зробили.
6279083	ukr	Сподіваюся, ми не програємо.
6279084	ukr	Том знав, що не дуже подобається Мері.
6279085	ukr	Думаю, Том, можливо, не зможе цього сьогодні зробити.
6279086	ukr	Том знав, що Мері не хоче пити пиво.
6279087	ukr	Том знав, що Мері, скоріш за все, не зайнята.
6279088	ukr	Я зробив добрий вибір.
6279089	ukr	Я зробила добрий вибір.
6279090	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не скаже мені це робити.
6279091	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що потрібно зробити.
6279092	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що треба зробити.
6279093	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том показав Мері, як це робиться?
6279094	ukr	Том запросив Мері у найдорожчий ресторан у місті.
6279095	ukr	Тобі не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279096	ukr	Вам не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279097	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені потрібно це зробити.
6279098	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де живе Мері.
6279099	ukr	У тебе гарний дім.
6279100	ukr	У тебе гарна оселя.
6279101	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені не треба цього робити.
6279102	ukr	Том не зміг зробити того, про що ми його попросили.
6279103	ukr	Я не певен, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279104	ukr	Я не певна, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279105	ukr	Том був дуже знервований, коли це відбувалося.
6279106	ukr	Мене не дивує, що Том хотів це зробити.
6279107	ukr	Мене не дивує, що Том хотів цим зайнятися.
6279108	ukr	У мене було погане відчуття щодо цього.
6279109	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері пішли на пляж.
6279110	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері ходили на пляж.
6279111	ukr	Я певен, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279112	ukr	Я певна, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279113	ukr	Шкода, що Тома немає тут, щоб показати нам, що робити.
6279114	ukr	Том сказав, що він хоче бути там о котрій годині?
6279115	ukr	Тост виглядає так, ніби згорів.
6279116	ukr	Грінка виглядає ніби згоріла.
6279117	ukr	Можливо, тобі не варто це більше робити з Томом.
6279118	ukr	Коли я розповів про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279119	ukr	Коли я розповіла про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279120	ukr	Том та Мері завжди робили це разом.
6279122	ukr	Де ваша парасолька?
6279123	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, позичить йому парасольку?
6279124	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб хто-небудь бачив, як він це робить.
6279125	ukr	Хто дозволив Тому взяти мій велосипед?
6279126	ukr	Том робить це так, як його навчила Мері.
6279127	ukr	Я не розумів, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279128	ukr	Я не усвідомлювала, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279129	ukr	У тебе гарний будинок.
6279130	ukr	У вас гарний будинок.
6279131	ukr	Том чув, що Мері сказала, що не може цього зробити.
6279132	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том бажав би нам допомогти.
6279133	ukr	Том проінформував Мері, що вона не має цього робити.
6279134	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купив.
6279135	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купила.
6279136	ukr	Том спробує знайти спосіб, як це зробити.
6279137	ukr	Думаю, тобі треба написати Тому лист-подяку.
6279138	ukr	Том знав, що Мері більше не мусить робити цього.
6279139	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279140	ukr	Я думала, що ви знаєте, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279141	ukr	Том взяв три книжки в бібліотеці.
6279142	ukr	Том чув, як Мері та Джон розмовляли про Еліс.
6279143	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс полюбляють танцювати.
6279144	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс люблять танці.
6279145	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс — канадійці.
6279146	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс живуть у Бостоні.
6279147	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс прийшли сюди разом.
6279148	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс приїхали сюди разом.
6279149	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс з Бостона.
6279150	ukr	Том та Джон одружені на сестрах.
6279151	ukr	Том сидить між Мері та Джоном.
6279152	ukr	Я думаю, Том попросить Мері зробити це для Джона.
6279153	ukr	Том не хоче, щоб Мері казала Джону будь-що.
6279154	ukr	Хто сказав Тому попросити Мері допомогти Джону зробити це?
6279155	ukr	Тобі слід зробити те, що ти можеш.
6279156	ukr	Вам слід зробити те, що ви можете.
6279157	ukr	Мені подобається гаряча кава.
6279158	ukr	Я люблю гарячу каву.
6279159	ukr	Це нелегко зробити.
6279160	ukr	Це було нелегко зробити.
6279161	ukr	Це було не дуже важко зробити.
6279162	ukr	Переконати Тома зробити це було неважко.
6279163	ukr	Переконати Тома зробити це було нескладно.
6279164	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було неважко це зробити.
6279165	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було нескладно це зробити.
6279166	ukr	Тома несправедливо звинуватили у злочині.
6279170	ukr	Туман розсіюється.
6279171	ukr	Тобі дійсно потрібно це зробити зараз.
6279172	ukr	Тобі дійсно зараз треба це зробити.
6279173	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно стільців.
6279174	ukr	Стільці більше не потрібні.
6279175	ukr	Якщо хочеш зробити це, зроби це.
6279176	ukr	Якщо хочете зробити це, зробіть це.
6279177	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно знову це зробити.
6279178	ukr	Вам буде потрібно зробити це знову.
6279179	ukr	Тобі слід це робити зараз.
6279180	ukr	Ти зараз повинен це робити.
6279181	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно грошей.
6279182	ukr	Я дійсно мав це зробити.
6279183	ukr	Я дійсно мала це зробити.
6279184	ukr	Тобі слід дотримуватися тут тиші.
6279185	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це швидко.
6279186	ukr	Вам слід зробити це швидко.
6279187	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно часу.
6279188	ukr	Це не мало багато сенсу.
6279189	ukr	Мені дійсно слід це зараз зробити.
6279190	ukr	Я знав, що ти цього не робитимеш.
6279191	ukr	Я знала, що ви цього не робитимете.
6279192	ukr	Я мав право це сказати.
6279193	ukr	Я мала право це сказати.
6279194	ukr	Том та Мері чекають на друг дитину.
6279195	ukr	Копати — важка праця.
6279196	ukr	Том хоче піти стопами свого батька.
6279200	ukr	Ти маєш це зробити.
6279201	ukr	Тобі слід бути в своїй кімнаті.
6279202	ukr	Вам слід бути в своїй кімнаті.
6279203	ukr	Будь ласка, ніколи не лишай мене.
6279205	ukr	Я придумаю, як це зробити.
6279207	ukr	Я мала право це зробити.
6279208	ukr	Мені снилося, як я це робив.
6279209	ukr	Мені снилося, як я це робила.
6279210	ukr	Я не хочу більше котів.
6279211	ukr	Тобі дійсно слід це зробити.
6279212	ukr	Вам дійсно слід це зробити.
6279213	ukr	Тобі слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279214	ukr	Вам слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279511	ukr	Я боявся, що загублю тебе.
6279512	ukr	Я боялася, що загублю вас.
6279513	ukr	Мені слід зараз бути в Бостоні.
6279514	ukr	Мені дійсно зараз треба бути у ліжку.
6279516	ukr	Не пийте забагато вина.
6279518	ukr	Будь ласка, не будь такою галасливою.
6279523	ukr	Ці діти ваші?
6279524	ukr	Тобі слід було це зробити.
6279525	ukr	Вам слід було це зробити.
6279526	ukr	Мені насправді потрібно це зробити.
6279527	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже втомленим.
6279528	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже втомленою.
6279529	ukr	Ці олівці твої?
6279530	ukr	Ці олівці ваші?
6279531	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це зараз.
6279532	ukr	Вам слід зробити це зараз.
6279533	ukr	Це не дуже допомогло.
6279534	ukr	Мені слід зробити це зараз.
6279535	ukr	Ці собаки твої?
6279536	ukr	Ці собаки ваші?
6279537	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це.
6279538	ukr	Вам слід зробити це.
6279539	ukr	Віддай мені усе.
6279540	ukr	Віддайте мені усу.
6279541	ukr	Цей собака ваш?
6279542	ukr	Цей собака твій?
6279543	ukr	Мені слід зробити це.
6279544	ukr	Хто нас врятує?
6279546	ukr	Дивись уважно, як я це роблю.
6279547	ukr	Спостерігайте уважно, як я це роблю.
6279548	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для тебе зробити.
6279549	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для вас зробити.
6279550	ukr	Ці яблука не були занадто дорогі.
6279551	ukr	Я думаю, ти теж можеш це зробити.
6279552	ukr	Я думаю, ви теж можете це зробити.
6279553	ukr	Учора Мері загубила свою сумочку.
6279554	ukr	Пропоную тобі зробити це зараз.
6279555	ukr	Пропоную вам зробити це зараз.
6279556	ukr	Давай заспіваєймо щось разом.
6279557	ukr	Заспіваймо щось разом.
6279558	ukr	Я все ще не отримаю задоволення від того, що роблю це.
6279559	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з тобою.
6279560	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з вами.
6279561	ukr	Я пішов з Мері на танці.
6279562	ukr	Ми з Мері пішли на танці.
6279563	ukr	Ти колись намагався це робити?
6279564	ukr	Ви колись намагалися це робити?
6279565	ukr	Ніхто не викликався добровольцем, щоб зробити це.
6279566	ukr	Я вирішив знову це зробити.
6279567	ukr	Я вирішила зробити це знову.
6279568	ukr	Ми не звиклі до такого гамору.
6279569	ukr	Я однозначно зроблю це сьогодні.
6279570	ukr	Ми готуємося піти.
6279571	ukr	Я би на твоєму місці зробив це.
6279572	ukr	Я би на вашому місці зробив це.
6279573	ukr	Покажи мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279574	ukr	Покажіть мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279575	ukr	Я все ще не хочу цього робити.
6279576	ukr	Мені подобається колір твоєї машини.
6279577	ukr	Мені подобається колір вашої машини.
6279578	ukr	Мені все ще не подобається це робити.
6279579	ukr	Сподіваюся, екзамен буде легкий.
6279580	ukr	Я купив нову пару взуття.
6279581	ukr	Я купив нове взуття.
6279582	ukr	Я не хочу сьогодні це робити.
6279583	ukr	Мені здається, тобі треба піти.
6279584	ukr	Мені здається, вам треба піти.
6279585	ukr	Ти прочитав усю книжку?
6279586	ukr	Ти прочитала усю книжку?
6279587	ukr	Ти все ще можеш це зробити?
6279588	ukr	Ви все ще можете це зробити?
6279589	ukr	Хіба не ти тут головний?
6279590	ukr	Хіба не ви тут головна?
6279591	ukr	Де тобі потрібно це зробити?
6279592	ukr	Де вам потрібно це зробити?
6279593	ukr	Де ти маєш це зробити?
6279594	ukr	Де ви маєте це зробити?
6279595	ukr	Ці яблука були дорогі.
6279596	ukr	Ми не звиклі до того, щоб це робити.
6279597	ukr	Думаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279598	ukr	Гадаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279599	ukr	Ніхто не допоміг би мені це зробити.
6279600	ukr	Мені насправді сподобалося тут бути.
6279601	ukr	Я закікавлений у тому, щоб це зробити.
6279602	ukr	Сподіваюся, я здам екзамен.
6279603	ukr	Я готуюся зробити це.
6279604	ukr	Шкода, що я більше не можу робити цього.
6279605	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш зробити паузу?
6279606	ukr	Я не поспішав це зробити.
6279607	ukr	Хто для нас готуватиме?
6279608	ukr	Думаю, нам не слід цього робити.
6279609	ukr	Я все ще шкодую, що не можу цього зробити.
6279610	ukr	Давай зіграємо партію у шахи.
6279611	ukr	Я колись мріяв про те, щоб зробити це.
6279612	ukr	Я колись мріяла про те, щоб зробити це.
6279613	ukr	Вже світлішає.
6279614	ukr	Я не знаю, хто може це зробити.
6279615	ukr	Я не міг утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279616	ukr	Я не могла утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279617	ukr	Я отримав багато задоволення від фільму.
6279618	ukr	Я отримала багато задоволення від фільму.
6279619	ukr	Я не думаю, що нам це потрібно.
6279620	ukr	Де нам потрібно це зробити?
6279621	ukr	Я тобі щось купив.
6279622	ukr	Я вам щось купила.
6279623	ukr	Де ми маємо це зробити?
6279624	ukr	Все ці олівці мої.
6279625	ukr	Коли нам потрібно це зробити?
6279626	ukr	Коли ти маєш це зробити?
6279627	ukr	Коли ви маєте це зробити?
6279628	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ти це зробив.
6279629	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ви це зробили.
6279630	ukr	Мері хотіла бути медсестрою.
6279631	ukr	Я б хотів, щоб я також це міг зробити.
6279632	ukr	Я б хотіла, щоб я також це могла зробити.
6279633	ukr	Вже темнішає.
6279634	ukr	Думаю, я це раз зробив.
6279635	ukr	Гадаю, я одного разу це зробила.
6279636	ukr	Я отримую багато задоволення, коли це роблю.
6279637	ukr	Всі відмовилися робити це.
6279638	ukr	Мені дуже сподобалося бути тут.
6279639	ukr	З ким нам слід це зробити?
6279640	ukr	Скільки заробляють учителі?
6279641	ukr	Скільки заробляють викладачі?
6279642	ukr	З ким ти міг би це зробити?
6279643	ukr	З ким ти могла би це зробити?
6279644	ukr	Коли ми маємо це зробити?
6279645	ukr	Ти тут головний?
6279646	ukr	Ви тут головна?
6279647	ukr	Я не звик до того, щоб це робити.
6279648	ukr	Я не звикла до того, щоб це робити.
6279649	ukr	Всі ці речі мої.
6279650	ukr	Я більше ніколи не робитиму.
6279651	ukr	Що ти робитимеш пізніше?
6279652	ukr	Що ви робитимите пізніше?
6279653	ukr	Я все ще сподіваюся, що зможу це зробити.
6279654	ukr	Прошу закрити вікна.
6279655	ukr	Закрийте вікна, будь ласка.
6279656	ukr	Обіцяю тобі, що я це зроблю.
6279657	ukr	Обіцяю вам, що зроблю це.
6279658	ukr	Я не буду більше намагатися.
6279659	ukr	Сподіваюся, я все ще можу це зробити.
6279660	ukr	Сподіваюся, я все ще вмію це робити.
6279661	ukr	Хіба ти ніколи цього не робив?
6279662	ukr	Хіба ви ніколи цього не робили?
6279663	ukr	Чому ми також не можемо цього зробити?
6279664	ukr	З ким ми могли б зробити це?
6279665	ukr	Хіба ти не голосуватимеш?
6279666	ukr	Хіба ви не будете голосувати?
6279667	ukr	Можливо, я зможу це зробити сьогодні.
6279668	ukr	Думаю, нам слід це зробити.
6279669	ukr	Ці яблука були дешеві.
6279670	ukr	Думаю, ти можеш це зробити.
6279671	ukr	Думаю, ви можете це зробити.
6279672	ukr	Я знаю, що ти цього не робив.
6279673	ukr	Я знаю, що ти цього не робила.
6279674	ukr	Хто нам допоможе?
6279675	ukr	А хто допоможе нам?
6279676	ukr	Я тобі не допомагатиму це робити.
6279677	ukr	Я вам не допомагатиму це робити.
6279678	ukr	Де нам треба робити це?
6279679	ukr	Де ти міг би це зробити?
6279680	ukr	Де ти могла би це зробити?
6279681	ukr	Що у тебе в шафі?
6279682	ukr	Що у вас в шафі?
6279683	ukr	Думаю, я зробив це одного разу.
6279684	ukr	Гадаю, я зробила це одного разу.
6279685	ukr	Ми все ще у небезпеці.
6279687	ukr	Сонце вже встало.
6279688	ukr	Мені все ще подобається це робити.
6279689	ukr	Твої черевики брудні.
6279690	ukr	У вас брудні черевики.
6279691	ukr	Я все ще сподіваюся це зробити.
6279692	ukr	Ми все ще спантеличені.
6279693	ukr	Де ми могли би це зробити?
6279694	ukr	Коли ти міг би це зробити?
6279695	ukr	Коли ти могла би це зробити?
6279696	ukr	Ти можеш скористатися моїм столом.
6279697	ukr	Ви можете скористатися моїм письмовим столом.
6279698	ukr	Ти любиш моркву?
6279699	ukr	Ви любите моркву?
6279700	ukr	Ти можеш скористатися моєю ручкою.
6279701	ukr	Ви можете скористатися моєю ручкою.
6279702	ukr	Я можу це для тебе зробити?
6279703	ukr	Я можу це зробити для вас?
6279704	ukr	Хто розбив тарілку?
6279705	ukr	Коли я міг би зробити це?
6279706	ukr	Коли я могла би зробити це?
6279707	ukr	Давай поміняємося місцями.

6285274	eng	In 1543, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus developed the mathematics of the sun-centered solar system and caused a great shift in scientists' view of the universe. His work led to the recognition that Earth does indeed orbit the sun and to the follow-on speculation that other stars had planets circling them.

6285282	eng	The invention of the telescope in the early 1600s revolutionized astronomy.
6285283	eng	Galileo was one of the first to use the telescope to search the heavens. Among his findings was spotting the four largest moons orbiting around Jupiter.
6285284	eng	Using the Hooker Telescope — the largest telescope of its day — at Mt. Wilson Observatory in California, astronomer Edwin Hubble found that some nebulae, such as the Andromeda nebula, were separate galaxies like our own Milky Way galaxy.
6285285	eng	Henrietta Swan Leavitt discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars.
6285286	eng	The first extrasolar planet, Pegasi 51 b, was discovered by astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the University of Geneva, using the ELODIE spectrograph on the Observatoire de Haute-Provence telescope in France.

6285294	eng	Another step forward in the search for extrasolar planets began with the launch in 2009 of the Kepler space observatory, NASA's first extrasolar mission. Kepler's goal was to search hundreds of thousands of stars for signs of planets.
6285295	eng	Kepler has found a diverse array of planets, including exotic, multi-planet solar systems.
6285296	eng	Kepler has found that smaller planets (Earth-sized rather than Jupiter-sized) are likely to be the most common in the Milky Way galaxy.
6285297	eng	Kepler uncovered several planets that are about the same size as Earth and orbit within the star's habitable zone, where liquid water, which is necessary for life, can exist.

6285300	eng	Overall, Kepler has added more than 1,200 confirmed planets to the extrasolar planet count, which now stands at nearly 3,700.
6285301	eng	Astronomers also have used NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which observes in infrared light, to study extrasolar planets. In 2007, the Spitzer telescope detected water vapor for the first time on another world.
6285302	eng	Hubble made one of the first visible-light images of an extrasolar planet circling the nearby, bright star Fomalhaut, located 25 light-years from Earth.
6285303	eng	Hubble also helped astronomers analyze the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.
6285304	eng	Hubble made the first measurements of the makeup of the atmospheres of two Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets.
6285305	eng	Even if a planet is rocky, Earth-sized, and just the right distance from its star, it also must have an atmosphere that contains the correct ingredients to foster and sustain life.
6285306	eng	Venus is Earth's twin by size, but its dense atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide, which helps keep the planet sizzling hot. Venus, therefore, is not hospitable for life.

6285311	eng	The distant worlds observed by Hubble and other telescopes are just the tip of the iceberg, according to a Hubble survey of the center of our Milky Way. The study revealed that our galaxy should be brimming with 100 billion planets, at least one planet for every star.
6285312	eng	NASA's New Horizons mission, for example, was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto in the outer solar system. The spacecraft’s images of Pluto show a surprisingly complex world with giant ice mountains that had never been seen before.
6285313	eng	The study of worlds outside our solar system will be continued by future spacecraft, such as NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and James Webb Space Telescope.
6285314	eng	TESS will find planets in the same manner as Kepler, but search stars that are closer to our sun.

6285324	eng	About a million years ago, an icy comet began its journey from its home in our distant solar system, hundreds of times farther out than any planet. Now, the comet has finally reached our inner solar system neighborhood as it follows its long path around the Sun.
6285325	eng	Comet Siding Spring was discovered in 2013 by astronomers at the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.
6285326	eng	Since Comet Siding Spring's discovery, astronomers have observed it with many telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope.

6285394	eng	Other planets have rings, but they are so faint that we cannot easily see them.
6285395	eng	Saturn's rings stand out because they are very bright and contain lots of material. Their brightness is due to their makeup. The rings are made of icy material that reflects sunlight, just as ice does on Earth.

6287099	eng	Let's begin with capitalism, a word that has gone largely out of fashion. The approved reference now is to the market system. This shift minimizes — indeed, deletes — the role of wealth in the economic and social system. And it sheds the adverse connotation going back to Marx. Instead of the owners of capital or their attendants in control, we have the admirably impersonal role of market forces. It would be hard to think of a change in terminology more in the interest of those to whom money accords power.

6287109	eng	Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.
6287110	rus	Что там у них случилось?

6287125	eng	Even the word depression itself was the terminological product of an effort to soften the connotation of deep trouble. In the last century, the term crisis was normally employed.

6293956	eng	The Grand Canyon, located in the northwest corner of Arizona, was carved out millions of years ago by water.
6293957	eng	The Grand Canyon is one mile deep and about 100 miles long.
6293958	eng	The deepest canyon in the world is the Tsangpo Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. The canyon is almost 3.5 miles deep and is slightly longer than the Grand Canyon.

6293960	eng	History has recorded many violent volcanic eruptions on Earth.
6293961	eng	In 1991, Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic outburst in the Philippines produced the second largest eruption of the 20th century. Ash from the blast was ejected as high as 21 miles above Earth. Particles from the eruption created a layer of sulfuric acid haze in Earth's atmosphere, dropping global temperatures by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit between 1991 and 1993.
6293962	eng	Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
6293963	eng	Olympus Mons, an inactive volcano on Mars, spreads over an area as large as the state of Arizona.

6293967	eng	Rivers are plentiful on Earth, and each river has a connection of streams that all flow into it. Some of Earth's solar-system neighbors show evidence that they once had similar river systems.
6293968	eng	Observations of Mars, Venus, and Titan reveal a series of thin channels that lead to larger channels. Although now dry, these channels could have once been river systems.
6293969	eng	Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.
6293970	eng	Earth's polar ice caps consist of water ice. Mars's polar caps, however, are a combination of water ice and carbon-dioxide ice.
6293971	eng	The Martian polar caps thaw in summer and freeze in winter, showing that our solar system's planets are dynamic and changing.
6293972	eng	Some of the moons in the outer solar system are completely covered in ice. They don't have just polar caps. They have ice shells.

6293978	eng	Beneath the icy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, lies a liquid ocean that may have more water than Earth contains.
6293979	eng	Images of Europa's surface show ice that has broken up into ice flows, suggesting that water beneath the surface is moving and cracking the ice.
6293980	eng	The ice on Europa is generally hundreds of miles thick.
6293981	eng	If you really want a place that harbors life, then Earth is it. Our planet is neither too hot nor too cold. It has fierce storms and winds, but not at the extremes seen elsewhere in the solar system.

6293989	eng	Haumea spins rapidly, turning once every four hours, and is believed to be composed mostly of rock with a thin, icy shell and a dark red spot.
6293990	eng	Astronomers think a collision with a larger body caused the dwarf planet to lose its surface ice, producing the rapid spin.
6293991	eng	Haumea is named for the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Haumea's moons are named for the goddess' two daughters.

6294023	eng	When we experience darkness, we are facing away from the sun. When we experience daylight, we are facing the sun.
6294024	eng	We can't see other stars during the day because the sun's light illuminates Earth's atmosphere.
6294025	eng	The sun is glowing, not burning like a fire.
6294026	eng	The sun glows because its temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius.

6294045	eng	Comets do not always have tails. They develop a fuzzy, shell-like cloud called a coma, and one, two, or three tails when near the sun.
6294046	eng	Comets have no coma or tail when far away from the sun.
6294047	deu	Er trocknete seine verschwitzte Stirn ab.

6294053	eng	Meteors are the bright flashes of light seen in the night sky. They are caused by meteoroids — small, solid objects moving through space that have entered Earth's atmosphere.
6294054	eng	Usually, meteoroids burn up in the atmosphere and never reach the ground. A meteorite is the chunk of material that does reach the ground.
6294055	eng	A meteor is a bright streak of light in the sky caused when a meteoroid (a small chunk of rock or ice) enters the Earth's atmosphere and heats up.

6294066	deu	Ich bin seit mehr als zwanzig Jahren mit ihm befreundet.
6294067	eng	The apparent brightness of our Sun is much greater than that of the star Rigel in the constellation Orion because it is so close to us. However, if both objects were placed at the same distance from us, Rigel would appear much brighter than our Sun because its absolute brightness is much larger.

Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic.

It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

6310124	eng	The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.
6310125	eng	"And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man?" I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered. "The word RACHE, written in letters of blood," he said.
6310126	eng	We were all silent for a while.
6310127	eng	There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his crimes.
6310128	eng	My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle, tingled as I thought of it.
6310129	eng	A milk boy, passing on his way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel.
6310130	eng	The man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat.
6310131	eng	We found blood-stained water in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the sheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.
6310132	eng	"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?" he asked.
6310133	eng	Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken.
6310134	eng	Whatever the motive of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.
6310135	eng	There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, 'J. H. is in Europe.'

6310144	eng	There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.
6310145	eng	Sherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight. "The last link," he cried, exultantly. "My case is complete."
6310146	eng	The two detectives stared at him in amazement.
6310147	eng	"I have now in my hands," my companion said, confidently, "all the threads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts."
6310148	eng	I went downstairs and carried the dog upstairs in my arms.

6310157	por	Já estamos casados.
6310158	eng	"All this seems strange to you," continued Holmes, "because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it."
6310159	por	Vocês já ganharam.
6310160	por	Já ganhaste.
6310161	eng	It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious, because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn.
6310162	eng	This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.

6310178	rus	Ты вернул свои деньги?
6310179	eng	"There will be no more murders," he said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us. "You can put that consideration out of the question."
6310180	eng	You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of his name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him.
6310181	eng	I wonder who sent the flowers?
6310182	rus	Моя младшая сестра немного ленивая.
6310183	eng	Mary received flowers from a secret admirer.
6310184	eng	"Gentlemen," he cried, with flashing eyes, "let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson."

6310193	eng	In the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilization. From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.

6310207	eng	In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life. There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth—above all, there is absolute silence.
6310208	eng	Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence—complete and heart-subduing silence.
6310209	eng	It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali. Approach and examine them! They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.
