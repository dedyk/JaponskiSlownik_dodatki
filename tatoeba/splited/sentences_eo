6262048	eng	Tom didn't really seem surprised.
6262049	eng	Wait until Monday to do that.
6262050	eng	Tom said that wasn't what Mary should've done.
6262051	eng	Tom didn't read the instructions.
6262052	eng	This hole needs to be deeper.
6262053	eng	Tom said that Mary would be back home by 2:30.
6262054	eng	Tom didn't look very comfortable.
6262055	eng	This doesn't taste very good.
6262056	eng	Tom said that Mary will go to Boston tomorrow.
6262057	eng	Tom didn't look like he was busy.
6262058	eng	This book is too hard for me.
6262059	eng	Tom said that Mary was still living in Boston.
6262060	eng	Tom didn't listen to his parents.
6262061	eng	They've just made me manager.
6262062	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't know how to do that.
6262063	eng	Tom didn't know a thing about it.
6262064	eng	They pay me a lot to do that.
6262065	eng	Tom said he's very sure Mary needs to do that.
6262066	eng	Tom didn't graduate from Harvard.
6262067	eng	There's only one thing to do.
6262068	eng	Tom said he's glad Mary has finally graduated.
6262069	eng	Tom didn't give a precise answer.
6262070	eng	There's nothing for me to do.
6262071	eng	Tom said he wouldn't mind doing that for Mary.
6262072	eng	Tom didn't expect this to happen.
6262073	eng	There's a tollbooth up ahead.
6262074	eng	Tom said he wished he'd kissed Mary goodnight.
6262075	eng	Tom didn't expect that to happen.
6262076	eng	There's a roadblock up ahead.
6262077	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't argued with Mary.
6262078	eng	Tom didn't even want to go there.
6262079	eng	The team needs a new captain.
6262080	eng	Tom said he was hoping he could cheer Mary up.
6262081	eng	Tom didn't enjoy studying French.
6262082	eng	The situation here is unique.
6262083	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to do that by herself.
6262084	eng	Tom didn't do what he says he did.
6262085	eng	The hall light is burned out.
6262086	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to help Mary.
6262087	eng	Tom didn't do that again, did he?
6262088	eng	The economy is in good shape.
6262089	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to do that.
6262090	eng	Tom didn't ask for my permission.
6262091	eng	The captain wants to see you.
6262092	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was going to do that.
6262093	eng	Tom didn't ask even one question.
6262094	eng	The airline lost my suitcase.
6262095	eng	Tom said he left a few minutes after Mary did.
6262096	eng	Tom didn't ask a single question.
6262097	eng	That's the woman I talked to.
6262098	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't do that again.
6262099	eng	Tom didn't appear to be too busy.
6262100	eng	That's the reason I did that.
6262101	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary didn't need to do that.
6262102	eng	Tom didn't acknowledge me at all.
6262103	eng	That's the hat I want to buy.
6262104	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary didn't have to do that.
6262105	eng	Tom did what you asked him to do.
6262106	eng	That's the car I want to buy.
6262107	eng	Tom said he hasn't met any of Mary's brothers.
6262108	eng	Tom did what we wanted him to do.
6262109	eng	That's not what I want to do.
6262110	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary should do that.
6262111	eng	Tom did that pretty much all day.
6262112	eng	That's not what I need to do.
6262113	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that.
6262114	eng	Tom did that not once, but twice.
6262115	eng	That's not what I have to do.
6262116	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary had to do that.
6262117	eng	Tom did that in a couple of days.
6262118	eng	That would change everything.
6262119	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really did that.
6262120	eng	Tom did that as soon as he could.
6262121	eng	Quit asking stupid questions.
6262122	eng	Tom said he didn't like the way Mary did that.
6262123	eng	Tom did his duty, and I did mine.
6262124	eng	Please hand in your homework.
6262125	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary could do that.
6262126	eng	Tom did a good job of leading us.
6262127	eng	Please give me this and this.
6262128	eng	Tom said he couldn't keep Mary for doing that.
6262129	eng	Tom deserves to lose his license.
6262130	eng	Please don't do that so much.
6262131	eng	Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
6262132	eng	Tom deserves that and a lot more.
6262133	eng	Please do that tomorrow, too.
6262134	eng	Tom said Mary would probably do that tomorrow.
6262135	eng	Tom delayed answering the letter.
6262136	eng	Please do that sometime soon.
6262137	eng	Tom said Mary will probably still be confused.
6262138	eng	Tom definitely won't get my vote.
6262139	eng	Perfume sometimes bothers me.
6262140	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't willing to do that again.
6262141	eng	Tom definitely wanted to do that.
6262142	eng	Our troubles aren't over yet.
6262143	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't interested in doing that.
6262144	eng	Tom definitely needed to do that.
6262145	eng	Our flight has been canceled.
6262146	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't happy that John did that.
6262147	eng	Tom decided to do that after all.
6262148	eng	October 20th was a rainy day.
6262149	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to help you do that.
6262150	eng	Tom cut down the tree with an ax.
6262151	eng	No two people react the same.
6262152	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to help him do that.
6262153	eng	Tom currently teaches at Harvard.
6262154	eng	No children were in the park.
6262155	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to do that tomorrow.
6262156	eng	Tom cried when he heard the news.
6262157	eng	My wife died three years ago.
6262158	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to do that for John.
6262159	eng	Tom could retire if he wanted to.
6262160	eng	My suitcase isn't very heavy.
6262161	eng	Tom said Mary was willing to buy that for you.
6262162	eng	Tom could probably do that alone.
6262163	eng	My savings will run out soon.
6262164	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to help you today.
6262165	eng	Tom could feel his knees shaking.
6262166	eng	My parents were both doctors.
6262167	eng	Tom said Mary was too tired to go any further.
6262168	eng	Tom could die from the infection.
6262169	eng	My old car is still out back.
6262170	eng	Tom said Mary was too out of shape to do that.
6262171	eng	Tom could be studying French now.
6262172	eng	My name is third on the list.
6262173	eng	Tom said Mary was told not to do that anymore.
6262174	eng	Tom could be hesitant to do that.
6262175	eng	My name is still on the list.
6262176	eng	Tom said Mary was the one who did that for us.
6262177	eng	Tom could be forgiven, I suppose.
6262178	eng	My left arm was badly burned.
6262179	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be confused.
6262180	eng	Tom could be doing that tomorrow.
6262181	eng	My house needs to be painted.
6262182	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be home on Monday.
6262183	eng	Tom could be called as a witness.
6262184	eng	My house isn't far from here.
6262185	eng	Tom said Mary was hoping we'd do that for her.
6262186	eng	Tom confined himself to his room.
6262187	eng	My house burned down in 2013.
6262188	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that on her own.
6262189	eng	Tom confessed that he was guilty.
6262190	eng	My help isn't needed anymore.
6262191	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that by herself.
6262192	eng	Tom completed his degree in 2013.
6262193	eng	My grandmother has gray hair.
6262194	eng	Tom said Mary was amused by what was going on.
6262195	eng	Tom complained about the service.
6262196	eng	My grandfather retired early.
6262197	eng	Tom said Mary seemed to be enjoying the party.
6262198	eng	Tom comes to see me now and then.
6262199	eng	My grandfather has gray hair.
6262200	eng	Tom said Mary ought to do that sometime today.
6262201	eng	Tom comes back from Boston today.
6262202	eng	My favorite season is summer.
6262203	eng	Tom said Mary needs to do that sometime today.
6262204	eng	Tom claimed he's never done that.
6262205	eng	My favorite month is October.
6262206	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that.
6262207	eng	Tom can't swim and neither can I.
6262208	eng	My family liked it in Boston.
6262209	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might need to do that.
6262210	eng	Tom can't do anything by himself.
6262211	eng	My contract won't be renewed.
6262212	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might have to do that.
6262213	eng	Tom can have everything he wants.
6262214	eng	My car is in the parking lot.
6262215	eng	Tom said Mary isn't usually at home on Monday.
6262216	eng	Tom can do that without any help.
6262217	eng	My car got stuck in the snow.
6262218	eng	Tom said Mary isn't troubled by what happened.
6262219	eng	Tom can do that however he likes.
6262220	eng	My brother is a veterinarian.
6262221	eng	Tom said Mary isn't amused by what's going on.
6262222	eng	Tom can do that for you, I think.
6262223	eng	My birthday is in three days.
6262224	eng	Tom said Mary is willing to help John do that.
6262225	eng	Tom can do that any way he likes.
6262226	eng	My French has improved a lot.
6262227	eng	Tom said Mary is going to ask John to do that.
6262228	eng	Tom can do both at the same time.
6262229	eng	Maybe we should visit Boston.
6262230	eng	Tom said Mary has been told not do that again.
6262231	eng	Tom came to a similar conclusion.
6262232	eng	Maybe I should do that today.
6262233	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked to do that again.
6262234	eng	Tom came rushing down the stairs.
6262235	eng	Maybe I need to do that, too.
6262236	eng	Tom said Mary frequently does that by herself.
6262237	eng	Tom calls his mother once a week.
6262238	eng	Maybe I have to do that, too.
6262239	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that.
6262240	eng	Tom believes that would be wrong.
6262241	eng	Mary made this dress herself.
6262242	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to do that with him.
6262243	eng	Tom believes that he can do that.
6262244	eng	Let's not study French today.
6262245	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John would do that.
6262246	eng	Tom began performing in the 2013.
6262247	eng	Let's not speak French today.
6262248	eng	Tom said Mary didn't think John could do that.
6262249	eng	Tom became a successful reporter.
6262250	eng	Let's go to Boston next week.
6262251	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound entirely convinced.
6262252	eng	Tom asked me why I had done that.
6262253	eng	Let's do that again tomorrow.
6262254	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have any books in French.
6262255	eng	Tom asked me what had to be done.
6262256	eng	Let me go to Boston with you.
6262257	eng	Tom probably knows where Mary went to college.
6262258	eng	Tom asked me to open the windows.
6262259	eng	It's way too late to do that.
6262260	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary was crying.
6262261	eng	Tom asked me to help him do that.
6262262	eng	It's tough to make ends meet.
6262263	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary was born.
6262264	eng	Tom asked me not to do that here.
6262265	eng	It's too late to do that now.
6262266	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is going.
6262267	eng	Tom asked me if he could do that.
6262268	eng	It's too cold to do that now.
6262269	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is hungry.
6262270	eng	Tom asked me if I studied French.
6262271	eng	It's time to stop doing that.
6262272	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary hates him.
6262273	eng	Tom asked for something to drink.
6262274	eng	It's illegal to do that here.
6262275	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary didn't do that.
6262276	eng	Tom appears unwilling to do that.
6262277	eng	It's OK to do that, isn't it?
6262278	eng	Tom must've thought Mary was going to do that.
6262279	eng	Tom apparently wanted to do that.
6262280	eng	It's OK if you don't do that.
6262281	eng	Tom lost his temper and threw his cup at Mary.
6262282	eng	Tom apparently needed to do that.
6262283	eng	It'll be possible to do that.
6262284	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he told her he did that.
6262285	eng	Tom apparently enjoys doing that.
6262286	eng	It'll be good if you do that.
6262287	eng	Tom kept Mary's letters locked in a metal box.
6262288	eng	Tom answered all of my questions.
6262289	eng	It'll be fun to visit Boston.
6262290	eng	Tom is the only person Mary wants to help her.
6262291	eng	Tom announced his plans to leave.
6262292	eng	It would be wrong to do that.
6262293	eng	Tom is the only one who ever really knew Mary.
6262294	eng	Tom and I've just gotten married.
6262295	eng	It would be tough to do that.
6262296	eng	Tom is the one standing between Mary and John.
6262297	eng	Tom and I've decided to break up.
6262298	eng	It would be smart to do that.
6262299	eng	Tom is the guy standing between Mary and John.
6262300	eng	Tom and I've decided not to come.
6262301	eng	It would be silly to do that.
6262302	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that without him.
6262303	eng	Tom and I've become good friends.
6262304	eng	It would be scary to do that.
6262305	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what John is going to do.
6262306	eng	Tom and I've always been friends.
6262307	eng	It would be risky to do that.
6262308	eng	Tom has told Mary to be here tomorrow at 2:30.
6262309	eng	Tom and I wrote a paper together.
6262310	eng	It would be cheap to do that.
6262311	eng	Tom has asked Mary to show him how to do that.
6262312	eng	Tom and I work at the same place.
6262313	eng	It was very cruel to do that.
6262314	eng	Tom has already told Mary what she has to buy.
6262315	eng	Tom and I wished each other well.
6262316	eng	It should be safe to do that.
6262317	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he wants to do.
6262318	eng	Tom and I were in the same class.
6262319	eng	Is there water in the bucket?
6262320	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he needs to do.
6262321	eng	Tom and I were alone in the room.
6262322	eng	Is there a desk in your room?
6262323	eng	Tom has already told Mary he wants to do that.
6262324	eng	Tom and I were alone in the cave.
6262325	eng	Is it dangerous if I do that?
6262326	eng	Tom has a guitar that looks a lot like Mary's.
6262327	eng	Tom and I went shopping together.
6262328	eng	If you're sleepy, take a nap.
6262329	eng	Tom had no idea when Mary was going to arrive.
6262330	eng	Tom and I wanted some time alone.
6262331	eng	If it snows, I won't do that.
6262332	eng	Tom forgot to tell Mary what she needed to do.
6262333	eng	Tom and I want to sell our house.
6262334	eng	I've had to postpone my trip.
6262335	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary did that, does he?
6262336	eng	Tom and I stayed up late talking.
6262337	eng	I've got a very bad headache.
6262338	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would let John do that.
6262339	eng	Tom and I spoke at the same time.
6262340	eng	I've found something strange.
6262341	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would enjoy doing that.
6262342	eng	Tom and I split a bottle of wine.
6262343	eng	I've done that several times.
6262344	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will forget to do that.
6262345	eng	Tom and I spent the day together.
6262346	eng	I did that just yesterday.
6262347	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be busy next week.
6262348	eng	Tom and I spent all day together.
6262349	eng	I've decided to visit Boston.
6262350	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is finished doing that.
6262351	eng	Tom and I sometimes jog together.
6262352	eng	I've decided to teach French.
6262353	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary has a driver's license.
6262354	eng	Tom and I seldom help each other.
6262355	eng	I've been waiting since 2:30.
6262356	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary did that intentionally.
6262357	eng	Tom and I sang the song together.
6262358	vie	Mình mới biết Tom đang làm cái gì
6262359	eng	I've been robbed three times.
6262360	eng	Tom doesn't need Mary's permission to do that.
6262361	eng	Tom and I really hate each other.
6262362	eng	I've been ordered to do that.
6262363	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary plays the drums.
6262364	eng	Tom and I rarely go out together.
6262365	eng	I've been doing that all day.
6262366	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary wasn't at his party.
6262367	eng	Tom and I quickly became friends.
6262368	eng	I'm very hesitant to do that.
6262369	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary wants me to do that.
6262370	eng	Tom and I often do that together.
6262371	eng	I'm trying to be cooperative.
6262372	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary is tired or not.
6262373	eng	Tom and I need to sell our house.
6262374	eng	I'm too young to get married.
6262375	eng	Tom doesn't know whether Mary can swim or not.
6262376	eng	Tom and I might do that together.
6262377	eng	I'm too young to drive a car.
6262378	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary thinks he's stupid.
6262379	eng	Tom and I live on the same floor.
6262380	eng	I'm too tired to do that now.
6262381	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends here except Mary.
6262382	eng	Tom and I haven't discussed that.
6262383	eng	I'm too tired to do anything.
6262384	eng	Tom doesn't have Mary's permission to do that.
6262385	eng	Tom and I have to sell our house.
6262386	eng	I'm too depressed to do that.
6262387	eng	Tom didn't want to believe that Mary did that.
6262388	eng	Tom and I hardly know each other.
6262389	eng	I'm to blame for all of this.
6262390	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary could speak French.
6262391	eng	Tom and I got married in October.
6262392	eng	I'm the person who does that.
6262393	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would forget to do that.
6262394	eng	Tom and I got divorced last year.
6262395	eng	I'm sure that'll change soon.
6262396	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was finished doing that.
6262397	eng	Tom and I go to the same dentist.
6262398	eng	I'm sure that you'll like it.
6262399	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he wanted to do that.
6262400	eng	Tom and I eventually got married.
6262401	eng	I'm sure that that'll happen.
6262402	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he needed more money.
6262403	eng	Tom and I enjoy singing together.
6262404	eng	I'm still willing to do that.
6262405	eng	Tom didn't seem to notice what Mary was doing.
6262406	eng	Tom and I don't trust each other.
6262407	eng	I'm quiet whenever I do that.
6262408	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary asked him to do that.
6262409	eng	Tom and I do everything together.
6262410	eng	I'm planning to teach French.
6262411	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was tired or not.
6262412	eng	Tom and I disagree on that point.
6262413	eng	I'm planning to study French.
6262414	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was happy or not.
6262415	eng	Tom and I didn't know what to do.
6262416	eng	I'm planning to speak French.
6262417	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary was planning to go.
6262418	eng	Tom and I didn't help each other.
6262419	eng	I'm often invited to parties.
6262420	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary had parked the car.
6262421	eng	Tom and I depended on each other.
6262422	eng	I'm not very sure about that.
6262423	eng	Tom didn't know where Mary had gone to school.
6262424	eng	Tom and I danced with each other.
6262425	eng	I'm not the least bit hungry.
6262426	eng	Tom didn't know when Mary was going to arrive.
6262427	eng	Tom and I can't stand each other.
6262428	eng	I'm not permitted to do that.
6262429	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was married to John.
6262430	eng	Tom and I bumped into each other.
6262431	eng	I'm not in a good mood today.
6262432	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was looking for him.
6262433	eng	Tom and I aren't doing very well.
6262434	eng	I'm not as rich as you think.
6262435	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was engaged to John.
6262436	eng	Tom and I are on the same flight.
6262437	eng	I'm not able to speak French.
6262438	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was able to do that.
6262439	eng	Tom and I are no longer together.
6262440	eng	I'm helping as much as I can.
6262441	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's daughter.
6262442	eng	Tom and I are in the living room.
6262443	eng	I'm happy whenever I do that.
6262444	eng	Tom didn't know how much money Mary had spent.
6262445	eng	Tom and I are having a good time.
6262446	eng	I'm going to have to do that.
6262447	eng	Tom didn't know Mary would do that so quickly.
6262448	eng	Tom and I are from the same town.
6262449	eng	I'm a freelance photographer.
6262450	eng	Tom didn't know Mary had to do that yesterday.
6262451	eng	Tom and I are enjoying ourselves.
6262452	eng	I'll wait for you until 2:30.
6262453	eng	Tom didn't keep his promise not to tease Mary.
6262454	eng	Tom and I agreed with each other.
6262455	eng	I'll show you how to do that.
6262456	eng	Tom didn't do everything Mary asked him to do.
6262457	eng	Tom always yells at his children.
6262458	eng	I'll go to Boston next month.
6262459	eng	Tom convinced Mary that she needed to do that.
6262460	eng	Tom always seems to be talkative.
6262461	eng	I'd rather not do that today.
6262462	eng	Tom asked Mary why she wanted to leave Boston.
6262463	eng	Tom always seems to be impatient.
6262464	eng	I'd rather not do that again.
6262465	eng	Tom asked Mary why she wanted to go to Boston.
6262466	eng	Tom always seems to be exhausted.
6262467	eng	I'd rather do that next week.
6262468	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't need to do that.
6262469	eng	Tom always seems to be confident.
6262470	eng	I'd rather do that by myself.
6262471	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like doing that.
6262472	eng	Tom always said he could do that.
6262473	eng	I'd never ever do that again.
6262474	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't have to do that.
6262475	eng	Tom always gets home before 2:30.
6262476	eng	I'd like to do that with you.
6262477	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to go for a walk.
6262478	eng	Tom always borrows money from me.
6262479	eng	I'd like to do that tomorrow.
6262480	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that today.
6262481	eng	Tom already has plans for Monday.
6262482	eng	I'd like to do that sometime.
6262483	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that today.
6262484	eng	Tom agrees that this makes sense.
6262485	eng	I'd like to buy that for you.
6262486	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to go to a movie together.
6262487	eng	Tom agreed to pick me up at 2:30.
6262488	eng	I'd like both sugar and milk.
6262489	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to go for a walk together.
6262490	eng	Tom actually did that to himself.
6262491	eng	I'd be opposed to doing that.
6262492	eng	Tom and Mary haven't done that in a long time.
6262493	eng	Tom actually did that by himself.
6262494	eng	I wouldn't do that by myself.
6262495	eng	Tom and Mary have decided to do that together.
6262496	eng	Tom accused me of stealing money.
6262497	eng	I would like to visit Boston.
6262498	eng	Tom and Mary don't usually eat the same thing.
6262499	eng	Tom's toys are all made of wood.
6262500	eng	I worked in Boston last year.
6262501	eng	Tom admitted to Mary that he couldn't do that.
6262502	eng	Tom's school has 3,000 students.
6262503	eng	I wonder if I should do that.
6262504	eng	Perhaps Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6262505	eng	Tom's performance was very good.
6262506	eng	I won't try to do that again.
6262507	eng	I'm going to need both Tom and Mary's support.
6262508	eng	Tom's jokes aren't always funny.
6262509	eng	I won't teach French, either.
6262510	eng	I'm glad Tom didn't see Mary and John kissing.
6262511	eng	Tom's house isn't far from here.
6262512	eng	I won't teach French anymore.
6262513	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks Mary needs to do that.
6262514	eng	Tom's going to Boston on Monday.
6262515	eng	I won't study French, either.
6262516	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary can't do that.
6262517	eng	Tom's funeral will be on Monday.
6262518	eng	I won't let you guys do that.
6262519	eng	I wonder if Tom knew that Mary had to do that.
6262520	eng	Tom's friends tried to help him.
6262521	eng	I won't let you go to Boston.
6262522	eng	I think Tom will be able to help Mary do that.
6262523	eng	Tom's friends couldn't help him.
6262524	eng	I won't go to Boston, either.
6262525	eng	I think Tom should try to get Mary to do that.
6262526	eng	Tom's efforts were unsuccessful.
6262527	eng	I won't go to Boston anymore.
6262528	eng	I think Tom should go to Boston to visit Mary.
6262529	eng	Tom's death was ruled a suicide.
6262530	por	O amor é, como a medicina, apenas a arte de ajudar a natureza.
6262531	eng	I won't force you to do that.
6262532	eng	I think Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6262533	eng	Tom's condition hasn't improved.
6262534	eng	I won't do that until Monday.
6262535	eng	I hope Tom is quicker at doing that than Mary.
6262536	eng	Tom wouldn't speak French to me.
6262537	eng	I won't do that anytime soon.
6262538	eng	I don't think Tom would care if Mary did that.
6262539	eng	Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6262540	eng	I won't come to Boston again.
6262541	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary hate each other.
6262542	eng	Tom wouldn't ask you to do that.
6262543	eng	I won't be staying in Boston.
6262544	eng	I don't believe Tom did what Mary said he did.
6262545	eng	Tom would like to buy a new car.
6262546	eng	I wish we had visited Boston.
6262547	eng	I didn't think Tom would enjoy Mary's concert.
6262548	eng	Tom would be willing to do that.
6262549	eng	I wish someone would do that.
6262550	eng	I didn't realize Tom had to help Mary do that.
6262551	eng	Tom would be nervous doing that.
6262552	eng	I wish I were back in Boston.
6262553	eng	I didn't know Tom wanted to help Mary do that.
6262554	eng	Tom would be foolish to do that.
6262555	eng	I wish I hadn't been so late.
6262556	eng	I didn't know Tom needed to help Mary do that.
6262557	eng	Tom would be ashamed to do that.
6262558	eng	I wish I had something to do.
6262559	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
6262560	eng	Tom won't permit you to do that.
6262561	eng	I went to a party last night.
6262562	eng	Fortunately, Tom didn't see Mary kissing John.
6262563	eng	Tom won't likely try to do that.
6262564	eng	I wasn't supposed to do that.
6262565	eng	Do you think Tom would permit Mary to do that?
6262566	eng	Tom won't likely be sympathetic.
6262567	eng	I wasn't in Boston last year.
6262568	eng	Did you know Tom used to have a crush on Mary?
6262569	eng	Tom won't likely be embarrassed.
6262570	eng	I wasn't in Boston last week.
6262571	eng	According to Tom, Mary isn't going to do that.
6262572	eng	Tom won't likely be discouraged.
6262573	eng	I wasn't at school yesterday.
6262574	eng	Why don't you get Tom to ask Mary to do that?
6262575	eng	Tom won't likely be cooperative.
6262576	eng	I wasn't at school last week.
6262577	eng	What Tom said about Mary probably isn't true.
6262578	eng	Tom won't likely be at home yet.
6262579	eng	I wasn't a very good student.
6262580	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he didn't do that.
6262581	eng	Tom won't have to do that alone.
6262582	eng	I was sitting at the counter.
6262583	eng	Tom would never forgive Mary if she did that.
6262584	eng	Tom won't have to do that again.
6262585	eng	I was asked to do that again.
6262586	eng	Tom would do that again if Mary asked him to.
6262587	eng	Tom won't admit that he's wrong.
6262588	eng	I was afraid to speak French.
6262589	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't need to do that.
6262590	eng	Tom will probably pass the exam.
6262591	eng	I wanted to help you do that.
6262592	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't have to do that.
6262593	eng	Tom will probably never do that.
6262594	eng	I wanted to go, but I didn't.
6262595	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't do that anymore.
6262596	eng	Tom will probably do that today.
6262597	eng	I wanted to buy that for you.
6262598	eng	Tom wondered who Mary thought would help her.
6262599	eng	Tom will probably come tomorrow.
6262600	eng	I want you to do that for me.
6262601	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary what he has to do.
6262602	eng	Tom will probably be unemployed.
6262603	eng	I want to talk to all of you.
6262604	eng	Tom won't be able to find the money Mary hid.
6262605	eng	Tom will probably be suspicious.
6262606	eng	I want to see you right away.
6262607	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary to go home early.
6262608	eng	Tom will probably be reasonable.
6262609	eng	I want to see you downstairs.
6262610	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary not to be afraid.
6262611	eng	Tom will probably be handcuffed.
6262612	eng	I want to see you doing that.
6262613	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he won't do that.
6262614	eng	Tom will probably be frightened.
6262615	eng	I want to leave, but I can't.
6262616	eng	Tom wasn't able to teach Mary how to do that.
6262617	eng	Tom will likely be grumpy today.
6262618	eng	I want to go back to college.
6262619	eng	Tom wasn't able to talk Mary into doing that.
6262620	eng	Tom will get married in October.
6262621	eng	I want to do that right away.
6262622	eng	Tom wasn't able to find what Mary had hidden.
6262623	eng	Tom will do that on Monday, too.
6262624	eng	I want to come to your party.
6262625	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary not to do that.
6262626	eng	Tom will do that again tomorrow.
6262627	eng	I want to buy out my partner.
6262628	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary how to do that.
6262629	eng	Tom will be skeptical, I'm sure.
6262630	eng	I want to buy a fishing boat.
6262631	eng	Tom was sure Mary knew she needed to do that.
6262632	eng	Tom will be sarcastic as always.
6262633	eng	I want to buy a Japanese car.
6262634	eng	Tom was kind of surprised that Mary did that.
6262635	eng	Tom will be hesitant to do that.
6262636	eng	I want to build my own house.
6262637	eng	Tom was fortunate that Mary did that for him.
6262638	eng	Tom wasn't very annoyed by that.
6262639	eng	I visited Boston last spring.
6262640	eng	Tom was able to persuade Mary not to do that.
6262641	eng	Tom wasn't permitted to do that.
6262642	eng	I used to study French a lot.
6262643	eng	Tom told me that Mary had decided to do that.
6262644	eng	Tom was tricked into doing that.
6262645	eng	I used to speak French a lot.
6262646	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed to buy a new car.
6262647	eng	Tom was treated at the hospital.
6262648	eng	I tried to do that by myself.
6262649	eng	Tom told Mary to do that as soon as possible.
6262650	eng	Tom was the only person injured.
6262651	eng	I thought it would be better.
6262652	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be unable to do that.
6262653	eng	Tom was the next one to do that.
6262654	eng	I thought I'd try to do that.
6262655	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be likely to do that.
6262656	eng	Tom was the first one to arrive.
6262657	eng	I thought I wouldn't do that.
6262658	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be afraid to do that.
6262659	eng	Tom was punished for doing that.
6262660	eng	I think that that won't work.
6262661	eng	Tom told Mary that he was too drunk to drive.
6262662	eng	Tom was my first French teacher.
6262663	eng	I think that I won't do that.
6262664	eng	Tom told Mary that he was through doing that.
6262665	eng	Tom was mugged again last night.
6262666	eng	I think it's time to give up.
6262667	eng	Tom told Mary that he was tempted to do that.
6262668	eng	Tom was hoping he could do that.
6262669	eng	I still want to study French.
6262670	eng	Tom told Mary that he was obliged to do that.
6262671	eng	Tom was held in the county jail.
6262672	eng	I still want to speak French.
6262673	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was pretty.
6262674	eng	Tom was going to do that anyway.
6262675	eng	I still plan to teach French.
6262676	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was biased.
6262677	eng	Tom was finally able to do that.
6262678	eng	I still plan to study French.
6262679	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was upset.
6262680	eng	Tom was excused from doing that.
6262681	eng	I still need to buy dog food.
6262682	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was tired.
6262683	eng	Tom was being forced to do that.
6262684	eng	I still haven't paid my rent.
6262685	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was right.
6262686	eng	Tom was arrested for doing that.
6262687	eng	I still haven't eaten dinner.
6262688	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was ready.
6262689	eng	Tom was able to get his own way.
6262690	eng	I still have to pay the bill.
6262691	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was pushy.
6262692	eng	Tom was a great influence on me.
6262693	eng	I started doing that in 2013.
6262694	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was lucky.
6262695	eng	Tom wants me to give him a loan.
6262696	eng	I spent the day at the beach.
6262697	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was funny.
6262698	eng	Tom wanted to make a difference.
6262699	eng	I sometimes do that even now.
6262700	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was drunk.
6262701	eng	Tom wanted to buy a cheaper car.
6262702	eng	I should've never been fired.
6262703	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was crazy.
6262704	eng	Tom usually goes to work by car.
6262705	eng	I should've done that sooner.
6262706	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was broke.
6262707	eng	Tom uses crutches to get around.
6262708	eng	I should've done that myself.
6262709	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was brave.
6262710	eng	Tom used to drink a lot of milk.
6262711	eng	I should've done much better.
6262712	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was bossy.
6262713	eng	Tom used to do that quite often.
6262714	eng	I should've been helping you.
6262715	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was bored.
6262716	eng	Tom turned right on Park Street.
6262717	eng	I should've been able to win.
6262718	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was awake.
6262719	eng	Tom tried to speak French to us.
6262720	eng	I should be back before 2:30.
6262721	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was angry.
6262722	eng	Tom tried to get out of the way.
6262723	eng	I saw a UFO three nights ago.
6262724	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was alone.
6262725	eng	Tom tried not to make any noise.
6262726	eng	I remember when you did that.
6262727	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was alive.
6262728	eng	Tom tried not to look surprised.
6262729	eng	I regretted having done that.
6262730	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought Alice was cute.
6262731	eng	Tom tried doing that by himself.
6262732	eng	I regret not studying French.
6262733	eng	Tom told Mary that John had been disobedient.
6262734	eng	Tom told us he wouldn't do that.
6262735	eng	I really should study French.
6262736	eng	Tom told Mary that John had been cooperative.
6262737	eng	Tom told us he couldn't do that.
6262738	eng	I really don't have a choice.
6262739	eng	Tom told Mary it was safe for her to do that.
6262740	eng	Tom told the judge he was sorry.
6262741	eng	I plan to live there someday.
6262742	eng	Tom thought Mary would be tempted to do that.
6262743	eng	Tom told me the road was closed.
6262744	eng	I ought to do that by myself.
6262745	eng	Tom thought Mary would be nervous doing that.
6262746	eng	Tom told me that he's terrified.
6262747	eng	I never felt like doing that.
6262748	eng	Tom thought Mary would be frightened by that.
6262749	eng	Tom told me that he's skeptical.
6262750	eng	I need you to come to Boston.
6262751	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't interested in sports.
6262752	eng	Tom told me that he's irritated.
6262753	eng	I need to borrow an umbrella.
6262754	eng	Tom thought Mary was the last one to do that.
6262755	eng	Tom told me that he's exhausted.
6262756	eng	I need to be told what to do.
6262757	eng	Tom thinks that Mary is the one who did that.
6262758	eng	Tom told me that he's depressed.
6262759	eng	I might need to study French.
6262760	eng	Tom thinks Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6262761	eng	Tom told me that he'd done that.
6262762	eng	I might need to speak French.
6262763	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be hesitant to do that.
6262764	eng	Tom told me that I was mistaken.
6262765	eng	I might have to study French.
6262766	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be reluctant to do that.
6262767	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't do that.
6262768	eng	I looked in the refrigerator.
6262769	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be motivated to do that.
6262770	eng	Tom told me he hated doing that.
6262771	eng	I like stir-fried vegetables.
6262772	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that with John.
6262773	eng	Tom told me I shouldn't do that.
6262774	eng	I know you'd hate to do that.
6262775	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be doing that very soon.
6262776	eng	Tom thinks you wouldn't do that.
6262777	eng	I know you understand French.
6262778	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be desperate to do that.
6262779	eng	Tom thinks that he's a big shot.
6262780	eng	I know you shouldn't do that.
6262781	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be awake until midnight.
6262782	eng	Tom thinks that he can prove it.
6262783	eng	I know you shouldn't be here.
6262784	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be at home this evening.
6262785	eng	Tom thinks he shouldn't do that.
6262786	eng	I know why you're suspicious.
6262787	eng	Tom thinks Mary wasn't in Boston last summer.
6262788	eng	Tom still hasn't washed his car.
6262789	eng	I know why I need to do that.
6262790	eng	Tom thinks Mary is amused by what's going on.
6262791	eng	Tom still hasn't mowed the lawn.
6262792	eng	I know why I have to do that.
6262793	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary wants to do.
6262794	eng	Tom still has a house in Boston.
6262795	eng	I know what the situation is.
6262796	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary needs to do.
6262797	eng	Tom still does that, doesn't he?
6262798	eng	I know what ought to be done.
6262799	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6262800	eng	Tom still does that quite often.
6262801	eng	I know what I'm getting into.
6262802	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he needs her to do.
6262803	eng	Tom still can't drive very well.
6262804	eng	I know the police suspect me.
6262805	eng	Tom should tell Mary he doesn't like his job.
6262806	eng	Tom started his blog in October.
6262807	eng	I know the job won't be easy.
6262808	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary how to do that.
6262809	eng	Tom spent the whole day walking.
6262810	eng	I know that you aren't ready.
6262811	eng	Tom should probably show Mary how to do that.
6262812	eng	Tom slept most of the afternoon.
6262813	eng	I know that I'll be punished.
6262814	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary to do that.
6262815	eng	Tom showed us a few card tricks.
6262816	eng	I know that I'll be arrested.
6262817	eng	Tom should probably not tell Mary he's tired.
6262818	eng	Tom showed me how to copy files.
6262819	eng	I know that I should do that.
6262820	eng	Tom should be faster at doing that than Mary.
6262821	eng	Tom shouldn't be doing that now.
6262822	eng	I know it won't happen again.
6262823	eng	Tom seems convinced that Mary has to do that.
6262824	eng	Tom should've done that with us.
6262825	eng	I know exactly what happened.
6262826	eng	Tom seemed to be aware of what Mary had done.
6262827	eng	Tom should've done that with me.
6262828	eng	I know everyone here by name.
6262829	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary would really do that.
6262830	eng	Tom should've done that himself.
6262831	eng	I know a lot about computers.
6262832	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't want to do that.
6262833	eng	Tom should've called the police.
6262834	eng	I know a lot about Australia.
6262835	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't need to do that.
6262836	eng	Tom should've brought more food.
6262837	eng	I know I'm going to be fired.
6262838	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't have to do that.
6262839	eng	Tom should've been more careful.
6262840	eng	I know I'll be here tomorrow.
6262841	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't need to do that.
6262842	eng	Tom should've been found guilty.
6262843	eng	I know I did something wrong.
6262844	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't have to do that.
6262845	eng	Tom should've arrived yesterday.
6262846	eng	I just did that this morning.
6262847	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary wants to do that, too.
6262848	eng	Tom should go ahead and do that.
6262849	eng	I just did that a moment ago.
6262850	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary is willing to do that.
6262851	eng	Tom should be safe here with us.
6262852	eng	I just can't do that anymore.
6262853	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary can help him tomorrow.
6262854	eng	Tom should be getting paid more.
6262855	eng	I intend to do that tomorrow.
6262856	eng	Tom says he heard Mary cracking her knuckles.
6262857	eng	Tom shot and killed both tigers.
6262858	eng	I intend to buy that for you.
6262859	eng	Tom says he forgot to remind Mary to do that.
6262860	eng	Tom shaved his head last summer.
6262861	eng	I hope you pass today's exam.
6262862	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would do that.
6262863	eng	Tom seems to have recognized me.
6262864	eng	I hope to see you in October.
6262865	eng	Tom says he doesn't know where Mary did that.
6262866	eng	Tom seems to be very happy here.
6262867	eng	I hope to see you again soon.
6262868	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what Mary should do.
6262869	eng	Tom seemed unwilling to do that.
6262870	eng	I hope to live there someday.
6262871	eng	Tom says he doesn't know what Mary has to do.
6262872	eng	Tom seemed to know who did that.
6262873	eng	I hope to do that eventually.
6262874	eng	Tom says he and Mary seldom eat out together.
6262875	eng	Tom seemed to do that just fine.
6262876	eng	I hope to become a carpenter.
6262877	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't doing that anymore.
6262878	eng	Tom seemed to be busy yesterday.
6262879	eng	I helped because I wanted to.
6262880	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to see the manager.
6262881	eng	Tom says you've got a big mouth.
6262882	eng	I haven't yet visited Boston.
6262883	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to see the manager.
6262884	eng	Tom says that he teaches French.

6262893	eng	Tom says that he didn't do that.
6262894	eng	I haven't done that recently.
6262895	eng	Tom said he's looking forward to seeing Mary.
6262896	eng	Tom says no teachers were there.
6262897	eng	I haven't actually done that.
6262898	eng	Tom said he's determined to do that for Mary.
6262899	eng	Tom says he's hoping to do that.
6262900	eng	I have to go to Boston today.
6262901	eng	Tom said he'd like to know why Mary did that.
6262902	eng	Tom says he's afraid to do that.
6262903	eng	I have to get my car painted.
6262904	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to do that for Mary.
6262905	eng	Tom says he'll do that tomorrow.

6262924	eng	I finally managed to do that.
6262925	eng	Tom said he hopes Mary won't want to do that.

6262969	eng	I don't want to go by myself.
6262970	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't good at speaking French.

6262992	eng	Tom said that wasn't the reason.
6262993	eng	I don't think Mary is pretty.
6262994	eng	Tom said Mary was talking to John on the bus.
6262995	eng	Tom said that it'll happen soon.

6263140	eng	Tom really does want to do that.
6263141	eng	I don't have an alibi either.
6263142	eng	Tom pretty much said the same thing Mary did.
6263143	eng	Tom really does need to do that.
6263144	eng	I don't have a full-time job.
6263145	eng	Tom noticed that Mary's lights were still on.
6263146	eng	Tom really does have to do that.
6263147	eng	I don't go to school anymore.
6263148	eng	Tom never expected Mary to refuse to do that.
6263149	eng	Tom ran a marathon last weekend.
6263150	eng	I don't get up early anymore.
6263151	eng	Tom may be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6263152	eng	Tom put his head out the window.
6263153	eng	I don't feel like doing that.
6263154	eng	Tom knows that Mary was the one who did that.
6263155	eng	Tom promised to help us do that.
6263156	eng	I don't feel anything at all.
6263157	eng	Tom is the only person who can help Mary now.

6263165	eng	I don't eat fruit very often.
6263166	eng	Tom hasn't told Mary why he wants to do that.
6263167	eng	Tom probably should do that now.
6263168	eng	I don't care how you do that.
6263169	eng	Tom has told Mary she needs to wear a helmet.
6263170	eng	Tom probably isn't swimming now.
6263171	eng	I don't believe you did that.
6263172	eng	Tom has already told Mary what she has to do.
6263173	eng	Tom probably can't speak French.
6263174	eng	I do that every chance I get.

6263182	eng	Tom plans to live there someday.
6263183	eng	I didn't want to leave early.
6263184	eng	Tom explained to Mary why she had to do that.
6263185	eng	Tom ought to have spoken French.
6263186	eng	I didn't want to kill anyone.
6263187	eng	Tom eventually told Mary that he'd done that.

6263202	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would like to do that.
6263203	eng	Tom often goes there by himself.

6263213	eng	I didn't think that was fair.
6263214	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would have to do that.
6263215	eng	Tom never finishes his homework.
6263216	eng	I didn't think I'd get fired.
6263217	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will do that tomorrow.

6263219	eng	I didn't think I'd be scared.

6263224	eng	Tom needs to take one more test.
6263225	eng	I didn't stay there for long.
6263226	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will agree to do that.
6263227	eng	Tom needs to borrow an umbrella.

6263234	eng	I didn't like that very much.
6263235	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is through doing that.
6263236	eng	Tom must've done that yesterday.
6263237	eng	I didn't know you were drunk.
6263238	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is allowed to do that.
6263239	eng	Tom must've been busy yesterday.
6263240	eng	I didn't know who to believe.
6263241	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can understand French.
6263242	eng	Tom must be hesitant to do that.
6263243	eng	I didn't know what was wrong.
6263244	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can do that that soon.
6263245	eng	Tom might study French tomorrow.
6263246	eng	I didn't know how to proceed.
6263247	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary has to do.
6263248	eng	Tom might not come to the party.
6263249	eng	I didn't know how bad it was.
6263250	eng	Tom doesn't need to tell Mary how to do that.
6263251	eng	Tom may do that if he'd like to.
6263252	eng	I didn't keep my appointment.

6263267	eng	I didn't get up early enough.
6263268	eng	Tom doesn't have to tell Mary how to do that.
6263269	eng	Tom likes going to kindergarten.
6263270	eng	I didn't get rich doing that.
6263271	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that. Mary will do it.
6263272	eng	Tom likely won't be cooperative.
6263273	eng	I didn't get paid last month.
6263274	eng	Tom does almost anything Mary asks him to do.
6263275	eng	Tom left at 2:30 in the morning.
6263276	eng	I didn't get home until dawn.
6263277	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be upset by that.
6263278	eng	Tom left all the windows closed.
6263279	eng	I didn't get here until 2:30.
6263280	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be in her office.
6263281	eng	Tom leafed through the magazine.
6263282	eng	I didn't feel very confident.
6263283	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was through doing that.
6263284	eng	Tom knows what ought to be done.
6263285	eng	I didn't feel the earthquake.
6263286	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was nervous doing that.
6263287	eng	Tom knows what he's looking for.
6263288	eng	I didn't feel safe in Boston.
6263289	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was doing that anymore.
6263290	eng	Tom knows what he did was wrong.
6263291	eng	I didn't even try to do that.
6263292	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he had to work late.

6263294	eng	I didn't do well on the test.
6263295	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she needed to know.

6263297	eng	I didn't do that fast enough.
6263298	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he wants her to do.
6263299	eng	Tom kept me waiting all morning.
6263300	eng	I didn't come here yesterday.
6263301	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary that he wanted her help.
6263302	eng	Tom just does what he has to do.
6263303	eng	I didn't apologize in French.
6263304	eng	Tom didn't know whether Mary was busy or not.
6263305	eng	Tom isn't working much nowadays.
6263306	eng	I did the same thing in 2013.
6263307	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary had put in the box.
6263308	eng	Tom isn't quite sure what to do.
6263309	eng	I did that just this morning.
6263310	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's ex-wife.
6263311	eng	Tom isn't on the wrestling team.
6263312	eng	I couldn't do that by myself.
6263313	eng	Tom didn't know if Mary would do that or not.
6263314	eng	Tom isn't likely like to be shy.
6263315	eng	I could never live in Boston.
6263316	eng	Tom didn't know if Mary could do that or not.
6263317	eng	Tom isn't likely doing that now.
6263318	eng	I could do that if wanted to.
6263319	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wasn't going to do that.
6263320	eng	Tom isn't going to be here long.
6263321	eng	I come to Boston quite a lot.
6263322	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was supposed to do that.
6263323	eng	Tom isn't going to be gone long.
6263324	eng	I can't wait to visit Boston.
6263325	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to help us.
6263326	eng	Tom isn't ever going to do that.
6263327	eng	I can't wait to go to Boston.
6263328	eng	Tom did his best to persuade Mary to do that.
6263329	eng	Tom isn't doing that any longer.
6263330	eng	I can't play chess very well.
6263331	eng	Tom couldn't believe that Mary could do that.
6263332	eng	Tom isn't coming back to Boston.
6263333	eng	I can't do everything myself.
6263334	eng	Tom could try to get Mary to stop doing that.
6263335	eng	Tom isn't able to do that today.
6263336	eng	I can't afford to retire yet.
6263337	eng	Tom could probably teach Mary how to do that.
6263338	eng	Tom is way too young to do that.
6263339	eng	I can go to Boston next week.
6263340	eng	Tom could probably talk Mary into doing that.
6263341	eng	Tom is very sure he can do that.
6263342	eng	I can eat wherever I want to.
6263343	eng	Tom could likely talk Mary out of doing that.
6263344	eng	Tom is very happy to have a job.
6263345	eng	I can eat whenever I want to.
6263346	eng	Tom could be quicker at doing that than Mary.
6263347	eng	Tom is very devoted to his wife.
6263348	eng	I can eat whatever I want to.
6263349	eng	Tom asked me if I thought Mary could do that.
6263350	eng	Tom is used to eating cold rice.
6263351	eng	I bought a house with a pool.
6263352	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like gardening.
6263353	eng	Tom is used to doing that alone.
6263354	eng	I almost didn't visit Boston.
6263355	eng	Tom asked Mary what she'd do if she were him.
6263356	eng	Tom is trying to manipulate you.
6263357	eng	I advise you to study French.
6263358	eng	Tom asked Mary what her favorite subject was.
6263359	eng	Tom is too upset to do that now.
6263360	eng	How was the dance last night?
6263361	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew why John was late.
6263362	eng	Tom is too tired to do that now.
6263363	eng	How often have you done that?
6263364	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew where John worked.
6263365	eng	Tom is too drunk to do that now.
6263366	eng	How often do you go downtown?
6263367	eng	Tom apologized to Mary for being so careless.
6263368	eng	Tom is too broke to do that now.
6263369	eng	How often do you buy flowers?
6263370	eng	Tom and Mary plan to get married next summer.
6263371	eng	Tom is too angry to do that now.
6263372	eng	How much should they be paid?
6263373	eng	Tom and Mary aren't the only ones doing that.
6263374	eng	Tom is the strongest man I know.
6263375	eng	How much did your watch cost?
6263376	eng	Tom and Mary are unlikely to want to do that.
6263377	eng	Tom is the strongest guy I know.
6263378	eng	How much did your shoes cost?
6263379	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is going to wait for us.
6263380	eng	Tom is the man I told you about.
6263381	eng	How many pencils did you buy?
6263382	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't permit Mary to do that.
6263383	eng	Tom is taller than his brothers.
6263384	eng	How many cousins do you have?
6263385	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach Mary how to do that.
6263386	eng	Tom is talking with his friends.
6263387	eng	How many cookies do you want?
6263388	eng	I wonder why Tom thought Mary had to do that.
6263389	eng	Tom is sure he needs to do that.
6263390	eng	How many bananas did you eat?
6263391	eng	I told Tom that I thought Mary could do that.
6263392	eng	Tom is supposed to be in Boston.
6263393	eng	How many bananas did you buy?
6263394	eng	I thought Tom would be able to cheer Mary up.
6263395	eng	Tom is still willing to do that.
6263396	eng	How many apples did you pick?
6263397	eng	I hope Tom is faster at doing that than Mary.
6263398	eng	Tom is still too young to drink.
6263399	eng	How did you meet that friend?
6263400	eng	I don't think Tom would've said that to Mary.
6263401	eng	Tom is still getting into shape.
6263402	eng	Have you finished doing that?
6263403	eng	I don't think Tom will allow Mary to do that.
6263404	eng	Tom is seldom at home on Monday.
6263405	eng	Have you ever studied French?
6263406	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that with Mary.
6263407	eng	Tom is reluctant not to do that.
6263408	eng	Have you ever eaten dog meat?
6263409	eng	I don't think Tom should ask Mary to do that.

6263411	eng	Everybody did that except me.
6263412	vie	Con mèo đen chạy nhanh thế.
6263413	vie	Không ai đưa mình đi đâu cả.
6263414	eng	I don't believe the rumor about Tom and Mary.
6263415	eng	Tom is rarely at home on Monday.
6263416	eng	Don't forget your sunglasses.
6263417	eng	I do think Tom shouldn't ask Mary to do that.
6263418	eng	Tom is one of my former clients.
6263419	eng	Don't forget to mow the lawn.
6263420	eng	I didn't tell Tom why Mary didn't want to go.
6263421	eng	Tom is older than he says he is.
6263422	eng	Doing that's a very bad idea.
6263423	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's ex-husband.
6263424	eng	Tom is often the first one here.
6263425	eng	Doing that would be romantic.
6263426	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary were related.
6263427	eng	Tom is mad at me for doing that.
6263428	eng	Doing that won't be much fun.
6263429	eng	Does Tom still go out with Mary every Monday?
6263430	eng	Tom is likely to try to do that.
6263431	eng	Doing that is very important.
6263432	eng	Do you think Tom will permit Mary to do that?
6263433	eng	Tom is likely to still be upset.
6263434	eng	Doing that here is dangerous.
6263435	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary used to be married?
6263436	eng	Tom is likely to still be tired.
6263437	eng	Does your room have a carpet?
6263438	eng	Did you know Tom and Mary are John's parents?
6263439	eng	Tom is likely to still be broke.
6263440	eng	Do you still wish to do that?
6263441	eng	Are Tom and Mary still married to each other?
6263442	eng	Tom is likely to still be bored.
6263443	eng	Do you still want to do that?
6263444	eng	You told Tom Mary would do that, didn't you?
6263445	eng	Tom is likely to still be awake.
6263446	eng	Do you still need to do that?
6263447	eng	You told Tom Mary could do that, didn't you?
6263448	eng	Tom is likely to still be alone.
6263449	eng	Do you still have to do that?
6263450	eng	Tom would do that for Mary, I'm pretty sure.
6263451	eng	Tom is likely to still be alive.
6263452	eng	Do you play soccer every day?
6263453	eng	Tom wondered who Mary used to be married to.
6263454	eng	Tom is likely to become violent.
6263455	eng	Do you enjoy teaching French?
6263456	eng	Tom wondered if Mary would do that for John.
6263457	eng	Tom is likely to be unimpressed.
6263458	eng	Do you drink a lot of coffee?
6263459	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary to go home early.
6263460	eng	Tom is likely to be sympathetic.
6263461	eng	Do both of you still do that?
6263462	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he won't do that.
6263463	eng	Tom is likely to be pessimistic.
6263464	eng	Didn't you intend to do that?
6263465	eng	Tom won't do that without Mary's permission.
6263466	eng	Tom is likely to be intoxicated.
6263467	eng	Didn't you do that yesterday?
6263468	eng	Tom won't come back as long as Mary is here.
6263469	eng	Tom is likely to be heartbroken.
6263470	eng	Did you have a good vacation?
6263471	eng	Tom will never permit Mary to do that again.
6263472	eng	Tom is likely to be embarrassed.
6263473	eng	Did I really have to do that?
6263474	eng	Tom will likely talk Mary out of doing that.
6263475	eng	Tom is likely to be disobedient.
6263476	eng	Could you go get that for me?

6263478	eng	Tom is likely to be discouraged.
6263479	eng	Could I borrow your scissors?
6263480	eng	Tom will give Mary everything she asked for.
6263481	eng	Tom is likely to be cooperative.
6263482	eng	Can you speak French, please?
6263483	eng	Tom wasn't able to persuade Mary to do that.
6263484	eng	Tom is interested in doing that.
6263485	eng	Can you remember their names?
6263486	eng	Tom was the one who advised Mary to do that.
6263487	eng	Tom is hoping to make a fortune.
6263488	eng	Can you help me next weekend?
6263489	eng	Tom was impressed by how well Mary did that.
6263490	eng	Tom is halfway to Boston by now.
6263491	eng	Both of my brothers did that.
6263492	eng	Tom took several pictures of Mary's parents.
6263493	eng	Tom is gradually getting better.
6263494	eng	At what time did you do that?
6263495	eng	Tom told me Mary didn't know how to do that.
6263496	eng	Tom is going to quit doing that.
6263497	eng	Are you the one who did that.
6263498	eng	Tom told Mary why he wasn't able to do that.
6263499	eng	Tom is glad to be healthy again.
6263500	eng	Are you proposing we do that?
6263501	eng	Tom told Mary why he didn't want to do that.

6263874	eng	Tom said Mary was told not to do that again.
6263875	eng	Tom does that a lot, doesn't he?
6263876	eng	When will you be doing that?
6263877	eng	Tom said Mary was the only one who did that.
6263878	eng	Tom died when he was very young.
6263879	eng	When does the concert start?
6263880	eng	Tom said Mary was sleeping when he got home.
6263881	eng	Tom died in 2013 of lung cancer.
6263882	eng	When did you buy your house?
6263883	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be sleepy.
6263884	eng	Tom didn't want to wait so long.
6263885	eng	When did you buy this house?
6263886	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be scared.
6263887	eng	Tom didn't want to teach French.
6263888	eng	What's your passport number?
6263889	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be lonely.
6263890	eng	Tom didn't want to speak French.
6263891	eng	What time does the zoo open?
6263892	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be hungry.
6263893	eng	Tom didn't want to sing anymore.
6263894	eng	What size shirt do you wear?
6263895	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be grumpy.
6263896	eng	Tom didn't speak French with us.
6263897	eng	What do you two do together?
6263898	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be groggy.
6263899	eng	Tom didn't sound too optimistic.
6263900	eng	What did you do last Monday?
6263901	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be afraid.
6263902	eng	Tom didn't seem to be surprised.
6263903	eng	What did you do after lunch?
6263904	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be undependable.
6263905	eng	Tom didn't seem to be impressed.
6263906	eng	What color do you like best?
6263907	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that tomorrow.
6263908	eng	Tom didn't see the truck coming.
6263909	eng	What are you most afraid of?
6263910	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that for John.
6263911	eng	Tom didn't say he would do that.
6263912	eng	We've both worked in Boston.
6263913	eng	Tom said Mary was determined not to do that.
6263914	eng	Tom didn't recommend doing that.
6263915	eng	We've been asked to do that.
6263916	eng	Tom said Mary wanted him to do that for her.
6263917	eng	Tom didn't react quickly enough.
6263918	eng	We're trying to do too much.
6263919	eng	Tom said Mary shouldn't have stayed so long.
6263920	eng	Tom didn't permit us to do that.
6263921	eng	We'd better do that quickly.
6263922	eng	Tom said Mary should've helped John do that.
6263923	eng	Tom didn't know about the party.
6263924	eng	We won't ever do that again.
6263925	eng	Tom said Mary should've done that last week.
6263926	eng	Tom didn't have to speak French.
6263927	eng	We were too busy to do that.
6263928	eng	Tom said Mary should've asked John for help.
6263929	eng	Tom didn't expect to walk again.
6263930	eng	We were told not to do that.
6263931	eng	Tom said Mary should do that someplace else.
6263932	eng	Tom didn't eat all of ice cream.
6263933	eng	We were in Boston yesterday.
6263934	eng	Tom said Mary only does that in the morning.
6263935	eng	Tom didn't do that the easy way.
6263936	eng	We want you to go to Boston.
6263937	eng	Tom said Mary needed to do that pretty soon.
6263938	eng	Tom didn't do that deliberately.
6263939	eng	We waited for you yesterday.
6263940	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might want to do that.
6263941	eng	Tom didn't dare to say anything.
6263942	eng	We visited Boston last week.
6263943	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might need to do that.
6263944	eng	Tom did what you told him to do.
6263945	eng	We should've studied harder.
6263946	eng	Tom said Mary knew he might have to do that.
6263947	eng	Tom did what we asked him to do.
6263948	eng	We should be in Boston soon.
6263949	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still very hungry.
6263950	eng	Tom did what he felt like doing.
6263951	eng	We seldom speak French here.
6263952	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still unconvinced.
6263953	eng	Tom did that exceptionally well.
6263954	eng	We live in different cities.
6263955	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still pessimistic.
6263956	eng	Tom did that at the last minute.
6263957	eng	We have nothing to left eat.
6263958	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still in her room.
6263959	eng	Tom devoted his life to science.
6263960	eng	We didn't have enough money.
6263961	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still heartbroken.
6263962	eng	Tom definitely wants to do that.
6263963	eng	We didn't do that yesterday.
6263964	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still embarrassed.
6263965	eng	Tom definitely plans to do that.
6263966	eng	We can't come to Boston now.
6263967	eng	Tom said Mary has to do that sometime today.
6263968	eng	Tom definitely needs to do that.
6263969	eng	We came to Boston yesterday.
6263970	eng	Tom said Mary has never driven a sports car.
6263971	eng	Tom could've refused to do that.
6263972	eng	Wait for me at the entrance.
6263973	eng	Tom said Mary has been trying to be careful.
6263974	eng	Tom could've died of starvation.
6263975	eng	Try to do that by all means.
6263976	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked not to do that.
6263977	eng	Tom could tell you who did that.
6263978	eng	This is the time to do that.
6263979	eng	Tom said Mary hardly ever does that anymore.
6263980	eng	Tom could probably teach French.
6263981	eng	This hole isn't deep enough.
6263982	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that sometime today.
6263983	eng	Tom could end up being arrested.
6263984	eng	This book isn't interesting.
6263985	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't need to do that today.
6263986	eng	Tom could easily have done that.
6263987	eng	This area has changed a lot.
6263988	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to do that today.
6263989	eng	Tom could do it if he wanted to.
6263990	eng	They're testing new weapons.
6263991	eng	Tom said I should've stayed and helped Mary.
6263992	eng	Tom could become very rich soon.
6263993	eng	They're often seen together.
6263994	eng	Tom quickly wrote down everything Mary said.
6263995	eng	Tom could be stranded somewhere.
6263996	eng	They both speak French well.
6263997	eng	Tom promised Mary he wouldn't do that again.
6263998	eng	Tom claims that it was my fault.
6263999	eng	They both did that together.
6264000	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary did that.
6264001	eng	Tom claimed he tried to do that.
6264002	eng	These trousers are too long.
6264003	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is now.
6264004	eng	Tom chuckled and shook his head.
6264005	eng	These books used to be mine.
6264006	eng	Tom probably doesn't know that Mary is busy.
6264007	eng	Tom can do that without my help.
6264008	eng	There's plenty of wine left.
6264009	eng	Tom must've thought Mary could speak French.
6264010	eng	Tom began to yell at his mother.
6264011	eng	There's no way I'll do that.
6264012	eng	Tom let Mary know that he wanted to do that.
6264013	eng	Tom began doing that last month.
6264014	eng	There's no rush. I can wait.
6264015	eng	Tom let Mary know he didn't know what to do.
6264016	eng	Tom became an ordained minister.
6264017	eng	There's no news from Boston.
6264018	eng	Tom knows that Mary shouldn't be doing that.
6264019	eng	Tom asked me to vacuum the room.
6264020	eng	The rain hasn't stopped yet.
6264021	eng	Tom knows that Mary is the one who did that.
6264022	eng	Tom asked me to stop doing that.
6264023	eng	The noise doesn't bother me.
6264024	eng	Tom is the only person Mary says she trusts.
6264025	eng	Tom asked me to do this for him.
6264026	eng	The movie is about to begin.
6264027	eng	Tom is the guy over there talking with Mary.
6264028	eng	Tom asked me to do that quietly.
6264029	eng	The economy is in bad shape.
6264030	eng	Tom is sure Mary knew she needed to do that.
6264031	eng	Tom asked me to do that quickly.
6264032	eng	The children are downstairs.
6264033	eng	Tom is still determined to do that for Mary.
6264034	eng	Tom asked me if I taught French.
6264035	eng	That idea sounds good to me.
6264036	eng	Tom is standing behind Mary in this picture.
6264037	eng	Tom asked me if I had done that.
6264038	eng	That doesn't any make sense.
6264039	eng	Tom is reluctant to do that, but Mary isn't.
6264040	eng	Tom asked me if I could do that.
6264041	eng	That could happen next week.
6264042	eng	Tom is permitted to do that, but Mary isn't.
6264043	eng	Tom asked for police protection.
6264044	eng	That appears to be the plan.
6264045	eng	Tom is going to be very happy Mary did that.
6264046	eng	Tom apparently wants to do that.
6264047	eng	Shouldn't you do that today?
6264048	eng	Tom is counting the days until Mary arrives.
6264049	eng	Tom apparently needs to do that.
6264050	eng	Shouldn't you be doing that?
6264051	eng	Tom informed Mary why she needed to do that.
6264052	eng	Tom and his friends are outside.
6264053	eng	Quite a few people did that.
6264054	eng	Tom hopes that Mary will be able to do that.
6264055	eng	Tom and I were wrong about that.
6264056	eng	Please remind me to do that.
6264057	eng	Tom hoped Mary would be well enough to come.
6264058	eng	Tom and I were also in the room.
6264059	eng	Please go ahead and do that.
6264060	eng	Tom has told Mary to do that more than once.
6264061	eng	Tom and I went sailing together.
6264062	eng	Our flight has been delayed.
6264063	eng	Tom has told Mary that she needs to do that.
6264064	eng	Tom and I went camping together.
6264065	eng	My visa needs to be renewed.
6264066	eng	Tom has told Mary not to do that by herself.
6264067	eng	Tom and I wanted to get married.
6264068	eng	My plan is perfect, I think.
6264069	eng	Tom has enough money to buy what Mary wants.
6264070	eng	Tom and I want to have children.
6264071	eng	My passport has been stolen.
6264072	eng	Tom has done what Mary said he needed to do.
6264073	eng	Tom and I want to be left alone.
6264074	eng	My office is on Park Street.
6264075	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he has to do.
6264076	eng	Tom and I want to adopt a child.
6264077	eng	My new house is really nice.
6264078	eng	Tom has already told Mary what he can't eat.
6264079	eng	Tom and I want different things.
6264080	eng	My mother is also a teacher.
6264081	eng	Tom has already told Mary she can't do that.
6264082	eng	Tom and I talked the whole time.
6264083	eng	My license has been revoked.
6264084	eng	Tom has advised me not to do that with Mary.
6264085	eng	Tom and I spoke French together.
6264086	eng	My house is just over there.
6264087	eng	Tom has advised Mary not to stop doing that.
6264088	eng	Tom and I recognized each other.
6264089	eng	My house has three bedrooms.
6264090	eng	Tom has advised Mary not to do that anymore.
6264091	eng	Tom and I raised three children.
6264092	eng	My flight has been canceled.
6264093	eng	Tom expects Mary to do that again on Monday.
6264094	eng	Tom and I played tennis all day.
6264095	eng	My favorite drink is coffee.
6264096	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to ever do that again.
6264097	eng	Tom and I played miniature golf.
6264098	eng	My dorm room was very small.
6264099	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to do that by herself.
6264100	eng	Tom and I play on the same team.
6264101	eng	My dog can swim pretty well.
6264102	eng	Tom doesn't think we can trust Mary anymore.
6264103	eng	Tom and I often travel together.
6264104	eng	My children go to bed early.
6264105	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would likely do that.
6264106	eng	Tom and I often help each other.
6264107	eng	My children are still awake.
6264108	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be discouraged.
6264109	eng	Tom and I need to work together.
6264110	eng	My car was stolen last week.
6264111	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will want to do that.
6264112	eng	Tom and I looked at one another.
6264113	eng	My car is parked over there.
6264114	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will need to do that.
6264115	eng	Tom and I laughed at each other.
6264116	eng	My car has been repossessed.
6264117	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like to do that.
6264118	eng	Tom and I haven't done that yet.
6264119	eng	My blood type is O positive.
6264120	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like doing that.
6264121	eng	Tom and I have to work together.
6264122	eng	My blood type is O negative.
6264123	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will have to do that.
6264124	eng	Tom and I have the same opinion.
6264125	eng	My backpack is on the table.
6264126	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will do that to John.
6264127	eng	Tom and I had a couple of beers.
6264128	eng	My French is getting better.
6264129	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will do that for you.
6264130	eng	Tom and I got married in Boston.
6264131	eng	My French has gotten better.
6264132	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary should be doing that.
6264133	eng	Tom and I got engaged last week.
6264134	eng	Most people here can't swim.
6264135	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary knows how to do that.
6264136	eng	Tom and I got along really well.
6264137	eng	Men and boys should do that.
6264138	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary can do that, does he?
6264139	eng	Tom and I got along fairly well.
6264140	eng	Maybe you'd like to do that.
6264141	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary is doing.
6264142	eng	Tom and I go to the same church.
6264143	eng	Mary is a farmer's daughter.
6264144	eng	Tom doesn't seem to know what Mary has done.
6264145	eng	Tom and I glanced at each other.
6264146	eng	Mary has too much makeup on.
6264147	eng	Tom doesn't remember asking Mary to do that.
6264148	eng	Tom and I encouraged each other.
6264149	eng	Many people like to do that.
6264150	eng	Tom doesn't need to know how Mary does that.
6264151	eng	Tom and I don't usually do that.
6264152	eng	Many people don't know that.
6264153	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary wanted to do that.
6264154	eng	Tom and I don't like each other.
6264155	eng	Make sure you don't do that.
6264156	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary doesn't like dogs.
6264157	eng	Tom and I don't fight that much.
6264158	eng	Make sure you do that today.
6264159	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary called the police.
6264160	eng	Tom and I don't do that anymore.
6264161	eng	Make sure you do that again.
6264162	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary and John broke up.
6264163	eng	Tom and I discussed the problem.
6264164	eng	Life is what you make of it.
6264165	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary wants to do that.
6264166	eng	Tom and I dated for three years.
6264167	eng	Let's go out to eat tonight.
6264168	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary needs to do that.
6264169	eng	Tom and I danced all night long.
6264170	eng	Let's go out on the veranda.
6264171	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't like him.
6264172	eng	Tom and I aren't happy together.
6264173	eng	Let's go out on the terrace.
6264174	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary isn't very happy here.
6264175	eng	Tom and I aren't all that close.
6264176	eng	Let's buy half a watermelon.
6264177	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary can understand French.
6264178	eng	Tom and I are still watching TV.
6264179	eng	Let's buy a box of cherries.
6264180	eng	Tom doesn't expect Mary to get here on time.
6264181	eng	Tom and I are still not married.
6264182	eng	It's too hot to do that now.
6264183	eng	Tom does that so much better than Mary does.
6264184	eng	Tom and I are mad at each other.
6264185	eng	It's snowing here in Boston.
6264186	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary knew how to swim.
6264187	eng	Tom and I are going to the mall.
6264188	eng	It's raining here in Boston.
6264189	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would want to do that.
6264190	eng	Tom and I are going to be there.
6264191	eng	It's probably OK to do that.
6264192	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would need to do that.
6264193	eng	Tom and I are distant relatives.
6264194	eng	It's now my turn to do that.
6264195	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would like to do that.
6264196	eng	Tom and I are a little confused.
6264197	eng	It's not always easy to win.
6264198	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would like doing that.
6264199	eng	Tom always tries not to be late.
6264200	eng	It's easy for me to do that.
6264201	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would have to do that.
6264202	eng	Tom always seems to be stubborn.
6264203	eng	It's bad manners to do that.
6264204	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be here so soon.
6264205	eng	Tom always seems to be punctual.
6264206	eng	It's already taken me hours.
6264207	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be back so soon.
6264208	eng	Tom always seems to be friendly.
6264209	eng	It's almost time to do that.
6264210	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary why he needed her help.
6264211	eng	Tom always seems to be confused.
6264212	eng	It's a good idea to do that.
6264213	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she needed to buy.
6264214	eng	Tom always seems to be barefoot.
6264215	eng	It would be wise to do that.
6264216	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what needed to be done.
6264217	eng	Tom almost hit a telephone pole.
6264218	eng	It would be safe to do that.
6264219	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he intended to do that.
6264220	eng	Tom almost always speaks French.
6264221	eng	It would be good to do that.
6264222	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he didn't like his job.
6264223	eng	Tom admitted he doesn't do that.
6264224	eng	It would be easy to do that.
6264225	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what Mary was doing.
6264226	eng	Tom, you don't have to do that.
6264227	eng	It was good that I did that.
6264228	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what Mary should do.
6264229	eng	Tom, you don't do that, do you?
6264230	eng	It took me hours to do that.
6264231	eng	Tom didn't seem to know what Mary had to do.
6264232	eng	Tom's technique is pretty good.
6264233	eng	It takes courage to do that.
6264234	eng	Tom didn't meet Mary until late in his life.
6264235	eng	Tom's room needs to be cleaned.
6264236	eng	It should be fun doing that.
6264237	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wouldn't be there.
6264238	eng	Tom's house is just over there.
6264239	eng	Is there any ice cream left?
6264240	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's sister.
6264241	eng	Tom's guitar playing isn't bad.
6264242	eng	Is it snowing now in Boston?
6264243	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's mother.
6264244	eng	Tom's car was stolen last week.
6264245	eng	Is it raining now in Boston?
6264246	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was John's cousin.
6264247	eng	Tom's bad eye is his right one.
6264248	eng	I've seen people doing that.
6264249	eng	Tom didn't know that I was Mary's boyfriend.
6264250	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me his plans.
6264251	eng	I've never worked in Boston.
6264252	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't want to do that.
6264253	eng	Tom would've wanted to do that.
6264254	eng	I've never seen you do that.
6264255	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't need to do that.
6264256	eng	Tom would never try to do that.
6264257	eng	I've learned how to do that.
6264258	eng	Tom didn't know Mary didn't have to do that.
6264259	eng	Tom would like to teach French.
6264260	eng	I've got to stop doing that.
6264261	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to refuse to do that.
6264262	eng	Tom would like to study French.
6264263	eng	I've done that once already.
6264264	eng	Tom didn't apologize to Mary for doing that.
6264265	eng	Tom would get dizzy doing that.
6264266	eng	I've considering doing that.
6264267	eng	Tom did that the way Mary told him to do it.
6264268	eng	Tom would be bad at doing that.
6264269	eng	I'm very tempted to do that.
6264270	eng	Tom did almost the same thing that Mary did.
6264271	eng	Tom would be a fool to do that.
6264272	eng	I'm very anxious to do that.
6264273	eng	Tom could be faster at doing that than Mary.
6264274	eng	Tom won't study French anymore.
6264275	eng	I'm trying to be optimistic.
6264276	eng	Tom asked if Mary really needed to be there.
6264277	eng	Tom won't speak French anymore.
6264278	eng	I'm too young to drink beer.
6264279	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that today.
6264280	eng	Tom won't likely be suspicious.
6264281	eng	I'm too drunk to drive home.
6264282	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that again.
6264283	eng	Tom won't likely be sleepy yet.
6264284	eng	I'm the perfect man for you.
6264285	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like swimming.
6264286	eng	Tom won't likely be reasonable.
6264287	eng	I'm sure that's what I need.
6264288	eng	Tom asked Mary where she had studied French.
6264289	eng	Tom won't likely be interested.
6264290	eng	I'm sure that'll change now.
6264291	eng	Tom asked Mary where she had first met John.
6264292	eng	Tom won't likely be here today.
6264293	eng	I'm studying to be a doctor.
6264294	eng	Tom asked Mary what time she usually got up.
6264295	eng	Tom won't likely be handcuffed.
6264296	eng	I'm on my way to Boston now.
6264297	eng	Tom asked Mary what her favorite season was.
6264298	eng	Tom won't likely be frightened.
6264299	eng	I'm not very good at sports.
6264300	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach John how to do that.
6264301	eng	Tom won't likely be doing that.
6264302	eng	I'm not sure how to respond.
6264303	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to go swimming.
6264304	eng	Tom won't likely be back today.
6264305	eng	I'm not planning to do that.
6264306	eng	Tom asked Mary if she would mind doing that.
6264307	eng	Tom won't ever do that anymore.
6264308	eng	I'm not as old as you think.
6264309	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really had to do that.
6264310	eng	Tom won't do that until Monday.
6264311	eng	I'm not a very good swimmer.
6264312	eng	Tom asked Mary if she enjoyed horror movies.
6264313	eng	Tom won't be home this weekend.
6264314	eng	I'm not a good chess player.
6264315	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to play tennis together.
6264316	eng	Tom wishes he'd done that, too.
6264317	eng	I'm much better than before.
6264318	eng	Tom and Mary live across the street from me.
6264319	eng	Tom wishes he hadn't done that.
6264320	eng	I'm happy we came to Boston.
6264321	eng	Tom and Mary don't do that together anymore.
6264322	eng	Tom wished he hadn't done that.
6264323	eng	I'm happy that you did that.
6264324	eng	Tom and Mary don't always do the same thing.
6264325	eng	Tom will study French tomorrow.
6264326	eng	I'm going to go and do that.
6264327	eng	Tom and Mary are going camping this weekend.
6264328	eng	Tom will return this week, too.
6264329	eng	I'm glad you didn't do that.
6264330	eng	This morning I saw Tom and Mary in the park.
6264331	eng	Tom will probably study French.
6264332	eng	I'm glad that didn't happen.
6264333	eng	Perhaps Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
6264334	eng	Tom will probably speak French.
6264335	eng	I'm feeling a little sleepy.
6264336	eng	Perhaps Tom can borrow some money from Mary.
6264337	eng	Tom will probably get homesick.
6264338	eng	I'm feeling a little hungry.
6264339	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is supposed to do that.
6264340	eng	Tom will probably do that soon.
6264341	eng	I'm doing what I need to do.
6264342	eng	Maybe Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6264343	eng	Tom will probably be suspended.
6264344	eng	I'm doing that this morning.
6264345	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
6264346	eng	Tom will probably be surprised.
6264347	eng	I'm being as quiet as I can.
6264348	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't care if Mary did that.
6264349	eng	Tom will probably be sarcastic.
6264350	eng	I'm a very impatient person.
6264351	eng	I wonder why Tom thinks Mary has to do that.
6264352	eng	Tom will probably be objective.
6264353	eng	I'll try my best to do that.
6264354	eng	I wish Tom hadn't convinced Mary to do that.
6264355	eng	Tom will probably be depressed.
6264356	eng	I'll study French next year.
6264357	eng	I told Tom I didn't know anybody named Mary.
6264358	eng	Tom will probably be concerned.
6264359	eng	I'll probably do that today.
6264360	eng	I thought Tom would be doing that with Mary.
6264361	eng	Tom will probably be back soon.
6264362	eng	I'll do that this afternoon.
6264363	eng	I think Tom could teach Mary how to do that.
6264364	eng	Tom will probably be awake now.
6264365	eng	I'll do that if you help me.
6264366	eng	I think Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
6264367	eng	Tom will need to do that again.
6264368	eng	I'll do that again tomorrow.
6264369	eng	I think Tom could stop Mary from doing that.
6264370	eng	Tom will likely be sympathetic.
6264371	eng	I'll be doing that tomorrow.
6264372	eng	I think Tom could help Mary if he wanted to.
6264373	eng	Tom will likely be pessimistic.
6264374	eng	I'd visit Boston if I could.
6264375	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary did that.
6264376	eng	Tom will likely be discouraged.
6264377	eng	I'd rather not do that here.
6264378	eng	I should tell Tom why Mary doesn't like him.
6264379	eng	Tom will likely be cooperative.
6264380	eng	I'd rather do that tomorrow.
6264381	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary wouldn't do that.
6264382	eng	Tom will help you study French.
6264383	eng	I'd like you to do that now.
6264384	eng	I don't think Tom did what Mary said he did.
6264385	eng	Tom will have to do that again.
6264386	eng	I'd like to see you do that.
6264387	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary don't like me.
6264388	eng	Tom will go to Boston, I think.
6264389	eng	I'd like to do that for you.
6264390	eng	I didn't want Tom to go to Boston with Mary.
6264391	eng	Tom will do that the next time.
6264392	eng	I'd be reluctant to do that.
6264393	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's boyfriend.
6264394	eng	Tom will be in Boston all week.
6264395	eng	I wouldn't do that with you.
6264396	eng	Has Tom ever criticized Mary for doing that?
6264397	eng	Tom went into the cave to hide.
6264398	eng	I work at the train station.
6264399	eng	Did you know Tom used to be married to Mary?
6264400	eng	Tom went into the cave and hid.
6264401	eng	I won't do that from now on.
6264402	eng	You should get Tom to tell Mary to do that.
6264403	eng	Tom wasn't very friendly to me.
6264404	eng	I won't be doing that again.
6264405	eng	Why were Tom and Mary in Boston last month?
6264406	eng	Tom wasn't interested in music.
6264407	eng	I wish you'd leave me alone.
6264408	eng	Tom's priorities aren't the same as Mary's.
6264409	eng	Tom wasn't at school on Monday.
6264410	eng	I wish you'd do that for me.
6264411	eng	Tom wouldn't have expected Mary to do that.
6264412	eng	Tom was unemployed at the time.
6264413	eng	I wish you'd come to Boston.
6264414	eng	Tom would be reluctant to do that for Mary.
6264415	eng	Tom was treated at a burn unit.
6264416	eng	I wish I had visited Boston.
6264417	eng	Tom would be disappointed if Mary did that.
6264418	eng	Tom was careful not to do that.
6264419	eng	I wish I had studied harder.
6264420	eng	Tom wondered who Mary's French teacher was.
6264421	eng	Tom was at the end of the line.
6264422	eng	I wish I had more free time.
6264423	eng	Tom wondered where Mary learned to do that.
6264424	eng	Tom was advised not to do that.
6264425	eng	I wish I had gone to Boston.
6264426	eng	Tom wondered where Mary had studied French.
6264427	eng	Tom wants to make a difference.
6264428	eng	I wish I had come to Boston.
6264429	eng	Tom wondered what movie Mary wanted to see.
6264430	eng	Tom used to study French a lot.
6264431	eng	I wish I could visit Boston.
6264432	eng	Tom wondered what inspired Mary to do that.
6264433	eng	Tom used to go to Boston a lot.
6264434	eng	I wish I could study French.
6264435	eng	Tom won't likely be as cooperative as Mary.
6264436	eng	Tom used to be able to do that.
6264437	eng	I wish I could go to Boston.
6264438	eng	Tom will be faster at doing that than Mary.
6264439	eng	Tom turned up three hours late.
6264440	eng	I went swimming last Monday.
6264441	eng	Tom wasn't the one who helped Mary do that.
6264442	eng	Tom tried to help the old lady.
6264443	eng	I went surfing this morning.
6264444	eng	Tom was the one who wanted Mary to do that.
6264445	eng	Tom told me you went to Boston.
6264446	eng	I watched a romantic comedy.
6264447	eng	Tom was happy that Mary helped him do that.
6264448	eng	Tom told me you studied French.
6264449	eng	I wasn't willing to do that.
6264450	eng	Tom was convinced that Mary had to do that.
6264451	eng	Tom told me to stop doing that.
6264452	eng	I wasn't wearing a seatbelt.
6264453	eng	Tom wanted Mary to show you how to do that.
6264454	eng	Tom told me to quit doing that.
6264455	eng	I wasn't wearing a name tag.
6264456	eng	Tom took a lot of pictures of Mary's house.
6264457	eng	Tom told me to go to bed early.
6264458	eng	I wasn't there this morning.
6264459	eng	Tom told Mary why he wanted her to do that.
6264460	eng	Tom told me that he's unbiased.
6264461	eng	I wasn't sure what to think.
6264462	eng	Tom told Mary why he needed her to do that.
6264463	eng	Tom told me that he's unafraid.
6264464	eng	I wasn't sure what happened.
6264465	eng	Tom told Mary to stop being so pessimistic.
6264466	eng	Tom told me that he's ticklish.
6264467	eng	I wasn't kidding about that.
6264468	eng	Tom told Mary to be there tomorrow at 2:30.
6264469	eng	Tom told me that he's prepared.
6264470	eng	I wasn't in class yesterday.
6264471	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd be able to do that.
6264472	eng	Tom told me he knew my brother.
6264473	eng	I wasn't having a good time.
6264474	eng	Tom told Mary that he was ready to do that.
6264475	eng	Tom told me I should wait here.
6264476	eng	I wasn't expecting any help.
6264477	eng	Tom told Mary that he told John to do that.
6264478	eng	Tom told me I couldn't do that.
6264479	eng	I wasn't able to stay awake.
6264480	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought she was cute.
6264481	eng	Tom thought you should do that.
6264482	eng	I wasn't able to get a visa.
6264483	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was sad.
6264484	eng	Tom thinks that we can do that.
6264485	eng	I wasn't able to find a job.
6264486	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was out.
6264487	eng	Tom teaches French once a week.
6264488	eng	I was told to do that again.
6264489	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was mad.
6264490	eng	Tom still studies French a lot.
6264491	eng	I was in no mood to do that.
6264492	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought John was fat.
6264493	eng	Tom still doesn't speak French.
6264494	eng	I was determined to do that.
6264495	eng	Tom told Mary that he couldn't eat peanuts.
6264496	eng	Tom spent the whole day hiking.
6264497	eng	I was alone in the elevator.
6264498	eng	Tom told Mary only what she needed to know.
6264499	eng	Tom spent some time doing that.
6264500	eng	I wanted to go to the beach.
6264501	eng	Tom told Mary it was OK for her to do that.
6264502	eng	Tom sounded like he had a cold.
6264503	eng	I wanted to go to Australia.
6264504	eng	Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
6264505	eng	Tom sold used cars for a while.
6264506	eng	I want you to come with you.
6264507	eng	Tom thought Mary would be more cooperative.
6264508	eng	Tom showed me a way to do that.
6264509	eng	I want to work in a factory.
6264510	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't nervous doing that.
6264511	eng	Tom should've done that sooner.
6264512	eng	I want to visit Boston, too.
6264513	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't drunk, but she was.
6264514	eng	Tom should've done that by now.
6264515	eng	I want to talk to you again.
6264516	eng	Tom thought Mary wanted to quit doing that.
6264517	eng	Tom should've done much better.
6264518	eng	I want to study French, too.
6264519	eng	Tom thought Mary probably wouldn't do that.
6264520	eng	Tom should've bought more food.
6264521	eng	I want to stay here tonight.
6264522	eng	Tom thought Mary might not want to do that.
6264523	eng	Tom should've been sympathetic.
6264524	eng	I want to sit by the window.
6264525	eng	Tom thought Mary looked nervous doing that.
6264526	eng	Tom should've been cooperative.
6264527	eng	I want to meet your parents.
6264528	eng	Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
6264529	eng	Tom should've been able to win.
6264530	eng	I want to go to grad school.
6264531	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be tempted to do that.
6264532	eng	Tom should really study French.
6264533	eng	I want to go to Boston, too.
6264534	eng	Tom thinks Mary will be nervous doing that.
6264535	eng	Tom should never do that again.
6264536	eng	I want to go out for a walk.
6264537	eng	Tom still doesn't know what Mary has to do.
6264538	eng	Tom should consider doing that.
6264539	eng	I want to get out of prison.
6264540	eng	Tom started crying when Mary left the room.
6264541	eng	Tom should come back to Boston.
6264542	eng	I want to get married again.
6264543	eng	Tom spent his thirtieth birthday with Mary.
6264544	eng	Tom should be here after lunch.
6264545	eng	I want to dye my hair black.
6264546	eng	Tom spends a lot of time talking with Mary.
6264547	eng	Tom set traps to catch rabbits.
6264548	eng	I want to do that very much.
6264549	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary he'd never do that.
6264550	eng	Tom seldom, if ever, does that.
6264551	eng	I want to do that by myself.
6264552	eng	Tom should've bought some flowers for Mary.
6264553	eng	Tom seems unwilling to do that.
6264554	eng	I want to cross this bridge.
6264555	eng	Tom should've asked Mary to stay in Boston.
6264556	eng	Tom seems to know who did that.
6264557	eng	I want to borrow some money.
6264558	eng	Tom should've asked Mary to come to Boston.
6264559	eng	Tom seems to be very miserable.
6264560	eng	I want to be like my father.
6264561	eng	Tom should try to get Mary to do that, too.
6264562	eng	Tom seems to be feeling lonely.
6264563	eng	I want to be a veterinarian.
6264564	eng	Tom should tell Mary why he had to do that.
6264565	eng	Tom seems to be afraid of dogs.
6264566	eng	I want to be a fire fighter.
6264567	eng	Tom should tell Mary what she needs to buy.
6264568	eng	Tom seemed to enjoy doing that.
6264569	eng	I usually eat dinner at six.
6264570	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to drive too fast.
6264571	eng	Tom says things are going well.
6264572	eng	I thought you would be late.
6264573	eng	Tom should tell Mary he'll never leave her.
6264574	eng	Tom says that he won't do that.
6264575	eng	I thought you weren't awake.
6264576	eng	Tom should tell Mary he intends to do that.
6264577	eng	Tom says that he can swim well.
6264578	eng	I thought you might do that.
6264579	eng	Tom should do that the way Mary showed him.
6264580	eng	Tom says he's good at swimming.
6264581	eng	I thought this would happen.
6264582	eng	Tom seemed to understand why Mary did that.
6264583	eng	Tom says he's good at juggling.
6264584	eng	I thought it would be worse.
6264585	eng	Tom says he'll ask Mary to do that for him.
6264586	eng	Tom says he's good at baseball.
6264587	eng	I think I already know that.
6264588	eng	Tom says he understands why Mary is scared.
6264589	eng	Tom says he's eager to do that.
6264590	eng	I study French all the time.
6264591	eng	Tom says he thought Mary was a good friend.
6264592	eng	Tom says he'll quit doing that.
6264593	eng	I still have thirty dollars.
6264594	eng	Tom says he saw Mary when he was in Boston.
6264595	eng	Tom says he'll need to do that.
6264596	eng	I shouldn't have to do that.
6264597	eng	Tom says he knows Mary won't buy a scooter.
6264598	eng	Tom says he'll keep doing that.
6264599	eng	I shouldn't have left early.
6264600	eng	Tom says he doesn't know why Mary did that.
6264601	eng	Tom says he'll have to do that.
6264602	eng	I shouldn't have been there.
6264603	eng	Tom says he doesn't expect Mary to do that.
6264604	eng	Tom says he'll do that for you.
6264605	eng	I shouldn't do that anymore.
6264606	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary would do that.
6264607	eng	Tom says he would've paid more.
6264608	eng	I should've locked the door.
6264609	eng	Tom says he didn't know Mary could do that.
6264610	eng	Tom says he won't speak French.
6264611	eng	I should've been suspicious.
6264612	eng	Tom says Mary is thinking about doing that.
6264613	eng	Tom says he intends to do that.
6264614	eng	I should make a reservation.
6264615	eng	Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
6264616	eng	Tom says he followed the rules.
6264617	eng	I should do that right away.
6264618	eng	Tom says Mary has forgotten how to do that.
6264619	eng	Tom says he feels the same way.
6264620	eng	I should do that more often.
6264621	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't feel like doing that.
6264622	eng	Tom says he can't speak French.
6264623	eng	I should definitely do that.
6264624	eng	Tom says Mary didn't seem to be interested.
6264625	eng	Tom says he believes in ghosts.
6264626	eng	I saw heard speaking French.
6264627	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary wanted to do.
6264628	eng	Tom saw a ship in the distance.
6264629	eng	I remember having done that.
6264630	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary needed to do.
6264631	eng	Tom said you're not happy here.

6264640	eng	Tom said the game was exciting.
6264641	eng	I need to leave early today.
6264642	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be tired.
6264643	eng	Tom said the audience was huge.
6264644	eng	I need to improve my grades.
6264645	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be happy.
6264646	eng	Tom said that it'd happen soon.
6264647	eng	I need to get more exercise.
6264648	eng	Tom said he'd never permit Mary to do that.
6264649	eng	Tom said that he won't do that.
6264650	eng	I need to do that every day.
6264651	eng	Tom said he'd expected Mary to participate.
6264652	eng	Tom said that he wasn't sleepy.
6264653	eng	I need to do that by myself.
6264654	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary to buy that for you.
6264655	eng	Tom said that he wasn't bitter.
6264656	eng	I need to buy a new toaster.
6264657	eng	Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
6264658	eng	Tom said that I should do that.

6264664	eng	Tom said it's a common problem.
6264665	eng	I might go home early today.
6264666	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to do that for him.
6264667	eng	Tom said his house was damaged.
6264668	eng	I may have to do that again.

6264670	eng	Tom said he's ready to do that.
6264671	eng	I may do whatever I want to.
6264672	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very happy.
6264673	eng	Tom said he's glad he did that.
6264674	eng	I looked down at the ground.
6264675	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't having fun.
6264676	eng	Tom said he's done that before.
6264677	eng	I looked at the speedometer.
6264678	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't busy today.
6264679	eng	Tom said he's done all of that.
6264680	eng	I looked around at everyone.
6264681	eng	Tom said he thought Mary enjoyed the party.
6264682	eng	Tom said he's always done that.
6264683	eng	I live in a gated community.
6264684	eng	Tom said he saw Mary in the park yesterday.
6264685	eng	Tom said he'll quit doing that.
6264686	eng	I know you'll never do that.
6264687	eng	Tom said he remembered seeing Mary do that.
6264688	eng	Tom said he'll help us do that.
6264689	eng	I know why you're terrified.
6264690	eng	Tom said he knew why Mary couldn't do that.
6264691	eng	Tom said he'll do that for you.
6264692	eng	I know why you're surprised.
6264693	eng	Tom said he knew who Mary's ex-husband was.
6264694	eng	Tom said he'd unlikely do that.
6264695	eng	I know why you got confused.
6264696	eng	Tom said he knew what Mary was going to do.

6264704	eng	I know what that's used for.
6264705	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
6264706	eng	Tom said he'd do that if I did.
6264707	eng	I know that you're bluffing.
6264708	eng	Tom said almost the same thing as Mary did.
6264709	eng	Tom said he'd do that for sure.
6264710	eng	I know that I'm replaceable.
6264711	eng	Tom said Mary will likely do that tomorrow.
6264712	eng	Tom said he'd do that for free.
6264713	eng	I know something about this.

6264724	eng	Tom said he won't speak French.

6264780	eng	Tom said Mary was crying all day yesterday.
6264781	eng	Tom said Monday should be busy.
6264782	eng	I just do what I have to do.
6264783	eng	Tom said Mary wanted to do that by herself.
6264784	eng	Tom said I should've done that.
6264785	eng	I just did that an hour ago.
6264786	eng	Tom said Mary needed to eat healthier food.
6264787	eng	Tom said I should visit Boston.
6264788	eng	I just did it for the money.

6264820	eng	Tom regretted having done that.
6264821	eng	I have to do that on Monday.
6264822	eng	Tom said Mary is going to do that tomorrow.
6264823	eng	Tom refused to help us do that.
6264824	eng	I have to do that by myself.
6264825	eng	Tom said Mary is going to do that for John.
6264826	eng	Tom refused to help me do that.
6264827	eng	I have to do that by Monday.
6264828	eng	Tom said Mary is amused by what's going on.
6264829	eng	Tom really was my first choice.
6264830	eng	I have three adult children.
6264831	eng	Tom said Mary has never met John's parents.
6264832	eng	Tom really should study French.
6264833	eng	I have no reason to do that.
6264834	eng	Tom said Mary has never eaten Mexican food.
6264835	eng	Tom really should speak French.
6264836	eng	I hate people who tell lies.
6264837	eng	Tom said Mary has been to Australia before.
6264838	eng	Tom really should go to Boston.
6264839	eng	I hate driving on icy roads.
6264840	eng	Tom said Mary has always been very helpful.
6264841	eng	Tom put on his coat and gloves.
6264842	eng	I had the day off yesterday.
6264843	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to do this week.
6264844	eng	Tom promised to do that for me.
6264845	eng	I guess I'll try doing that.
6264846	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to do that today.
6264847	eng	Tom promised he'll check on it.
6264848	eng	I got to Boston before dark.
6264849	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound very optimistic.
6264850	eng	Tom promised he would be there.
6264851	eng	I go to Boston once a month.
6264852	eng	Tom said Mary didn't need to do that today.
6264853	eng	Tom probably shouldn't do that.
6264854	eng	I gave up trying to do that.
6264855	eng	Tom said Mary didn't need to do that again.
6264856	eng	Tom plans to go back to Boston.
6264857	eng	I forgot to buy the tickets.
6264858	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to do that today.
6264859	eng	Tom plans to buy a another car.
6264860	eng	I finally agreed to do that.
6264861	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to do that again.
6264862	eng	Tom owned a bar on Park Street.
6264863	eng	I figured this would happen.
6264864	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to read.
6264865	eng	Tom only wanted thirty dollars.
6264866	eng	I felt compelled to do that.
6264867	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have a dependable car.
6264868	eng	Tom only needed thirty dollars.
6264869	eng	I feel compelled to do that.
6264870	eng	Tom said I should've asked Mary to help me.
6264871	eng	Tom only does that on weekends.
6264872	eng	I don't want to take a taxi.
6264873	eng	Tom refused to do what Mary told him to do.
6264874	eng	Tom often gets home about 2:30.
6264875	eng	I don't want to leave early.
6264876	eng	Tom probably doesn't know why Mary is here.
6264877	eng	Tom never visited me in prison.
6264878	eng	I don't want to kill anyone.
6264879	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary works.
6264880	eng	Tom never does that on his own.
6264881	eng	I don't want to be the boss.
6264882	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary lives.
6264883	eng	Tom never does that by himself.
6264884	eng	I don't want to be punished.
6264885	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how sick Mary is.
6264886	eng	Tom needs to come home by 2:30.
6264887	eng	I don't want to be arrested.
6264888	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how rich Mary is.
6264889	eng	Tom needs to buy a new bicycle.
6264890	eng	I don't want to be a lawyer.
6264891	eng	Tom only told Mary what she needed to know.
6264892	eng	Tom needs to be home on Monday.
6264893	eng	I don't want that right now.
6264894	eng	Tom needs to make sure that Mary does that.
6264895	eng	Tom needed to be ready by 2:30.
6264896	eng	I don't want anyone to know.
6264897	eng	Tom must've thought Mary wanted to do that.
6264898	eng	Tom must be tempted to do that.
6264899	eng	I don't usually lock my car.
6264900	eng	Tom must've thought Mary needed to do that.
6264901	eng	Tom might not do that tomorrow.
6264902	eng	I don't usually eat dessert.
6264903	eng	Tom lied to Mary when he said he loved her.
6264904	eng	Tom might need to speak French.
6264905	eng	I don't think it's my fault.
6264906	eng	Tom let Mary know that he couldn't do that.
6264907	eng	Tom might have to teach French.
6264908	eng	I don't think I'll be early.
6264909	eng	Tom knows why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6264910	eng	Tom might have to study French.
6264911	eng	I don't think I'll be bored.
6264912	eng	Tom knows Mary hasn't been very happy here.
6264913	eng	Tom might have to speak French.
6264914	eng	I don't think I'll be alone.
6264915	eng	Tom just told Mary what she needed to know.
6264916	eng	Tom may have anything he wants.
6264917	eng	I don't really speak French.
6264918	eng	Tom isn't likely to permit Mary to do that.
6264919	eng	Tom may go to Boston next week.
6264920	eng	I don't really like to swim.
6264921	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary to do that for him.
6264922	eng	Tom may do that if he wants to.
6264923	eng	I don't really believe that.
6264924	eng	Tom is still reluctant to do that for Mary.
6264925	eng	Tom looks like he belongs here.
6264926	eng	I don't plan to leave today.
6264927	eng	Tom is good at singing, but Mary is better.
6264928	eng	Tom looked like he wasn't busy.
6264929	eng	I don't need to leave today.
6264930	eng	Tom is going to be very sad if Mary leaves.
6264931	eng	Tom likes the way you did that.
6264932	eng	I don't need to do that now.
6264933	eng	Tom is doing that because Mary told him to.
6264934	eng	Tom likes science, but I don't.
6264935	eng	I don't mind if you do that.
6264936	eng	Tom informed Mary why he wanted to do that.
6264937	eng	Tom likes playing in the creek.
6264938	eng	I don't like washing dishes.
6264939	eng	Tom informed Mary why he needed to do that.
6264940	eng	Tom likes Boston and I do, too.
6264941	eng	I don't like this very much.
6264942	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what needs to be done.
6264943	eng	Tom likely won't be back today.
6264944	eng	I don't like spinach at all.
6264945	eng	Tom has told Mary that he needs to do that.
6264946	eng	Tom knows what he needs to buy.
6264947	eng	I don't like romance novels.

6264949	eng	Tom knows that I won't do that.

6264955	eng	Tom knows it isn't a good idea.
6264956	eng	I don't like being a waiter.
6264957	eng	Tom had a hunch that Mary wouldn't do that.
6264958	eng	Tom knows how to throw a party.
6264959	eng	I don't know who'll do that.
6264960	eng	Tom forgot to tell Mary what she had to do.
6264961	eng	Tom knows he can't be replaced.
6264962	eng	I don't know who to believe.
6264963	eng	Tom doesn't want to know why Mary did that.
6264964	eng	Tom knows I can't speak French.
6264965	eng	I don't know what was wrong.
6264966	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to do that right now.

6264968	eng	I don't know much about art.
6264969	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was having fun.
6264970	eng	Tom knew that he could do that.

6264972	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary should do that.

6265355	eng	Tom had reason to be concerned.
6265356	eng	Your accusations are false.
6265357	eng	Tom told Mary John didn't want to do that.
6265358	eng	Tom had every right to do that.
6265359	eng	Your French is really good.
6265360	eng	Tom thought Mary wouldn't need to do that.
6265361	eng	Tom had a very successful year.
6265362	eng	You've done so much for us.
6265363	eng	Tom thought Mary wouldn't like to do that.
6265364	eng	Tom had a good time doing that.
6265365	eng	You're tempted, aren't you?
6265366	eng	Tom thought Mary wouldn't have to do that.
6265367	eng	Tom goes to bed at ten o'clock.
6265368	eng	You're such an inspiration.
6265369	eng	Tom thought Mary would be glad to see him.
6265370	eng	Tom goes to Boston quite often.
6265371	eng	You're my favorite teacher.
6265372	eng	Tom thought Mary was desperate to do that.
6265373	eng	Tom goes to Boston once a year.
6265374	eng	You're expected to do that.
6265375	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be ready to do that.
6265376	eng	Tom gets paid a lot to do that.
6265377	eng	You're entitled to do that.
6265378	eng	Tom still hopes Mary will do that for him.
6265379	eng	Tom frequently comes to Boston.
6265380	eng	You're annoyed, aren't you?
6265381	eng	Tom spent three hours with Mary yesterday.
6265382	eng	Tom finally managed to do that.
6265383	eng	You're a very good student.
6265384	eng	Tom spent a lot of time talking with Mary.
6265385	eng	Tom filled his glass with wine.
6265386	eng	You're a very good painter.
6265387	eng	Tom smiled when Mary walked into the room.
6265388	eng	Tom felt himself being carried.
6265389	eng	You're a very good drummer.
6265390	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary about what he did.
6265391	eng	Tom fell overboard and drowned.
6265392	eng	You're a very creative guy.
6265393	eng	Tom shouldn't have done that without Mary.
6265394	eng	Tom enjoys reading comic books.
6265395	eng	You're a really good coach.
6265396	eng	Tom should've asked Mary why she did that.
6265397	eng	Tom eats oatmeal for breakfast.
6265398	eng	You're a really bad driver.
6265399	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants to eat.
6265400	eng	Tom drew me a map to his house.
6265401	eng	You're a pretty stupid guy.
6265402	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants to buy.
6265403	eng	Tom doesn't want to be jealous.
6265404	eng	You're a good photographer.
6265405	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he needs to buy.
6265406	eng	Tom doesn't want me to do that.
6265407	eng	You're a good chess player.
6265408	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to do that again.
6265409	eng	Tom doesn't think I'll do that.
6265410	eng	You're a good banjo player.
6265411	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to be frightened.
6265412	eng	Tom doesn't study French a lot.
6265413	eng	You'll do that, too, right?
6265414	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's sleepy.
6265415	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be unhappy.
6265416	eng	You'd love skiing, I think.
6265417	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's hungry.
6265418	eng	Tom doesn't often study French.
6265419	eng	You'd better do that today.
6265420	eng	Tom seemed to know what Mary wanted to do.
6265421	eng	Tom doesn't often speak French.
6265422	eng	You'd better do that again.
6265423	eng	Tom seemed to know what Mary needed to do.
6265424	eng	Tom doesn't need to do a thing.
6265425	eng	You work nights, don't you?
6265426	eng	Tom says he's willing to do that for Mary.
6265427	eng	Tom doesn't like to talk a lot.
6265428	eng	You work nearby, don't you?
6265429	eng	Tom says he knows Mary can't speak French.
6265430	eng	Tom doesn't like to be outside.
6265431	eng	You want to win, don't you?
6265432	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary refuses to do that.
6265433	eng	Tom doesn't like being lied to.
6265434	eng	You volunteered to do this.
6265435	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who to avoid.
6265436	eng	Tom doesn't know much about it.
6265437	eng	You usually do that for us.
6265438	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows who did that.
6265439	eng	Tom doesn't get paid much to do that.
6265440	eng	You took notes, didn't you?
6265441	eng	Tom says he doesn't believe Mary did that.
6265442	eng	Tom doesn't even know who I am.
6265443	eng	You told us not to do that.
6265444	eng	Tom says Mary has never been to his house.
6265445	eng	Tom doesn't do that very often.
6265446	eng	You shouldn't buy that car.
6265447	eng	Tom says Mary doesn't think John did that.
6265448	eng	Tom doesn't do that on Mondays.
6265449	eng	You should help me do that.
6265450	eng	Tom says Mary didn't come home last night.
6265451	eng	Tom doesn't care who does that.
6265452	eng	You should drink something.
6265453	eng	Tom sat next Mary with his arm around her.
6265454	eng	Tom doesn't believe I did that.
6265455	eng	You seemed to be exhausted.
6265456	eng	Tom said the accident wasn't Mary's fault.
6265457	eng	Tom does what he's asked to do.
6265458	eng	You seemed to be depressed.
6265459	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary wants to do.
6265460	eng	Tom does want to go to college.
6265461	eng	You seem a bit disoriented.
6265462	eng	Tom said that's not what Mary needs to do.
6265463	eng	Tom does that when he's sleepy.
6265464	eng	You rarely do that anymore.
6265465	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't do that again.
6265466	eng	Tom does that when he's hungry.
6265467	eng	You promised you'd do that.
6265468	eng	Tom said that Mary would do that tomorrow.
6265469	eng	Tom does that for us every day.
6265470	eng	You play tennis, don't you?
6265471	eng	Tom said that Mary won't do that tomorrow.
6265472	eng	Tom does do that, but not well.
6265473	eng	You play hockey, don't you?
6265474	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't working anymore.
6265475	eng	Tom died at his home on Monday.
6265476	eng	You ought to do that today.
6265477	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't married anymore.
6265478	eng	Tom didn't want to work for us.
6265479	eng	You must not do that again.
6265480	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to talk to John.
6265481	eng	Tom didn't want to take a taxi.
6265482	eng	You may borrow my umbrella.
6265483	eng	Tom said that Mary should be more careful.
6265484	eng	Tom didn't want to go swimming.
6265485	eng	You look worse than before.
6265486	eng	Tom said that Mary has to be more careful.
6265487	eng	Tom didn't want me to help him.
6265488	eng	You look very disappointed.
6265489	eng	Tom said that Mary has been sick all week.
6265490	eng	Tom didn't take the medication.
6265491	eng	You look lost and confused.
6265492	eng	Tom said that Mary had been very careless.
6265493	eng	Tom didn't study French either.
6265494	eng	You look like you're happy.
6265495	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't want to do that.
6265496	eng	Tom didn't speak French either.
6265497	eng	You look like you're bored.
6265498	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be busy.
6265499	eng	Tom didn't seem to have a cold.
6265500	eng	You look a little confused.
6265501	eng	Tom said he's willing to do that for Mary.
6265502	eng	Tom didn't say why he did that.
6265503	eng	You look a bit embarrassed.
6265504	eng	Tom said he'll do that for Mary this time.
6265505	eng	Tom didn't remember to do that.
6265506	eng	You live nearby, don't you?
6265507	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary to do that for you.
6265508	eng	Tom didn't remember doing that.
6265509	eng	You like sports, don't you?
6265510	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary to do that for him.
6265511	eng	Tom didn't really seem shocked.
6265512	eng	You like soccer, don't you?
6265513	eng	Tom said he wished Mary would never leave.
6265514	eng	Tom didn't hesitate to do that.
6265515	eng	You like reggae, don't you?
6265516	eng	Tom said he was hoping he could help Mary.
6265517	eng	Tom didn't have what he needed.
6265518	eng	You like horses, don't you?
6265519	eng	Tom said he was going to do that for Mary.
6265520	eng	Tom didn't have a dog for long.
6265521	eng	You like hockey, don't you?
6265522	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't do that.
6265523	eng	Tom didn't get paid to do that.
6265524	eng	You like comics, don't you?
6265525	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
6265526	eng	Tom didn't finish his homework.
6265527	eng	You like coffee, don't you?
6265528	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't in Boston.
6265529	eng	Tom didn't even try to do that.
6265530	eng	You like cheese, don't you?
6265531	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't at school.
6265532	eng	Tom didn't do that fast enough.
6265533	eng	You inspired us to do that.
6265534	eng	Tom said he thought Mary enjoyed swimming.
6265535	eng	Tom did what we told him to do.
6265536	eng	You hate school, don't you?
6265537	eng	Tom said he sold his car to Mary for $300.
6265538	eng	Tom did what he intended to do.
6265539	eng	You drank beer, didn't you?
6265540	eng	Tom said he sees Mary at school every day.
6265541	eng	Tom did what I asked him to do.
6265542	eng	You don't smile very often.
6265543	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary should do that.
6265544	eng	Tom did that whenever he could.
6265545	eng	You don't have to eat that.
6265546	eng	Tom said he knew that Mary had to do that.
6265547	eng	Tom did that until it got dark.
6265548	eng	You do that extremely well.
6265549	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't be afraid.
6265550	eng	Tom did that in methodical way.
6265551	eng	You did that the wrong way.
6265552	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would do that soon.
6265553	eng	Tom did that a number of times.
6265554	eng	You biked home, didn't you?
6265555	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary works.
6265556	eng	Tom did that a couple of times.
6265557	eng	Would you all please leave?
6265558	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary did that.
6265559	eng	Tom decided to do that instead.
6265560	eng	Won't you do that tomorrow?
6265561	eng	Tom said he didn't expect Mary to do that.
6265562	eng	Tom decided against doing that.
6265563	eng	Why won't you come with me?
6265564	eng	Tom said he assumed Mary wouldn't do that.
6265565	eng	Tom couldn't do that, could he?
6265566	eng	Why should we study French?
6265567	eng	Tom said Mary would very unlikely do that.
6265568	eng	Tom couldn't afford to do that.
6265569	eng	Why should we go to Boston?
6265570	eng	Tom said Mary would probably be back soon.
6265571	eng	Tom could've been more careful.
6265572	eng	Why is it wrong to do that?
6265573	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't reluctant to do that.
6265574	eng	Tom could still be unconvinced.
6265575	eng	Why don't you just do that?
6265576	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't motivated to do that.
6265577	eng	Tom could quit if he wanted to.
6265578	eng	Why don't you go to school?
6265579	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't annoyed by the noise.
6265580	eng	Tom could force you to do that.
6265581	eng	Why don't you do that more?
6265582	eng	Tom said Mary was trying to be optimistic.
6265583	eng	Tom could easily have said yes.
6265584	eng	Why do you like doing that?
6265585	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be weak.
6265586	eng	Tom could be stubborn at times.
6265587	eng	Why did you try to do that?
6265588	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be lost.
6265589	eng	Tom could be afraid to do that.
6265590	eng	Why can't you go to Boston?
6265591	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be here.
6265592	eng	Tom complained about the smell.
6265593	eng	Why are we studying French?
6265594	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be cold.
6265595	eng	Tom can't teach French anymore.
6265596	eng	Whose sunglasses are these?
6265597	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be unemployed.
6265598	eng	Tom can't speak French, either.
6265599	eng	Who's the one who did that?
6265600	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be suspicious.
6265601	eng	Tom can't go to Boston, either.
6265602	eng	Who's supposed to be there?
6265603	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be supportive.
6265604	eng	Tom can't go to Boston with me.
6265605	eng	Who's living in Boston now?
6265606	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be reasonable.
6265607	eng	Tom can speak French, can't he?
6265608	eng	Who's in the classroom now?
6265609	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be interested.
6265610	eng	Tom can have anything he wants.
6265611	eng	Who were you swimming with?
6265612	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be frustrated.
6265613	eng	Tom can do that if he wants to.
6265614	eng	Who was in Boston with you?
6265615	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be frightened.

6265618	toki	jan Ton li wile ala e ijo ni.
6265619	eng	Tom can do that extremely well.
6265620	eng	Who picked all the peaches?
6265621	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be displeased.
6265622	eng	Tom can do that again tomorrow.
6265623	eng	Who else did that with you?
6265624	eng	Tom said Mary was happy that you did that.
6265625	eng	Tom came up with a good excuse.
6265626	eng	Who did you hear that from?
6265627	eng	Tom said Mary was good at speaking French.
6265628	eng	Tom came to visit us yesterday.
6265629	eng	Who are you thinking about?
6265630	eng	Tom said Mary was going to take that risk.
6265631	eng	Tom came out of the room first.
6265632	eng	Which train will you be on?
6265633	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that for us.
6265634	eng	Tom bought that car for $3,000.
6265635	eng	Which of the boys did that?
6265636	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that for me.
6265637	eng	Tom bought a lot near the lake.
6265638	eng	Where's my striped sweater?
6265639	eng	Tom said Mary was going to do that anyway.
6265640	eng	Tom became a professor in 2013.
6265641	eng	Where will you be tomorrow?
6265642	eng	Tom said Mary was glad he got there early.
6265643	eng	Tom barely had time to do that.
6265644	eng	Where were you last spring?
6265645	eng	Tom said Mary was excused from doing that.
6265646	eng	Tom asked me to sweep the room.
6265647	eng	Where did you study French?
6265648	eng	Tom said Mary was asleep when he got home.
6265649	eng	Tom asked me to close the door.
6265650	eng	When will you take a break?
6265651	eng	Tom said Mary was almost ready to do that.
6265652	eng	Tom asked me several questions.
6265653	eng	When did the concert start?
6265654	eng	Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
6265655	eng	Tom asked me if I had a sister.
6265656	eng	What's your favorite month?
6265657	eng	Tom said Mary should've gone home earlier.
6265658	eng	Tom asked if he had to do that.
6265659	eng	What's Boston's population?
6265660	eng	Tom said Mary ought to do that by herself.
6265661	eng	Tom arrived earlier than I did.
6265662	eng	What will you leave behind?
6265663	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still terrified.
6265664	eng	Tom apologized to the audience.
6265665	eng	What time will you do that?
6265666	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still skeptical.
6265667	eng	Tom and I've talked about that.
6265668	eng	What didn't you understand?
6265669	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still sarcastic.
6265670	eng	Tom and I yelled at each other.
6265671	eng	What did you eat yesterday?
6265672	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still irritated.
6265673	eng	Tom and I were laughing at you.
6265674	eng	What color is your new coat?
6265675	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still in Boston.
6265676	eng	Tom and I went hiking together.
6265677	eng	What color car did you buy?
6265678	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still depressed.
6265679	eng	Tom and I want to study French.
6265680	eng	We've had a very good year.
6265681	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still concerned.

6265683	eng	We've been told to do that.
6265684	eng	Tom said Mary is interested in doing that.
6265685	eng	Tom and I want to learn French.
6265686	eng	We've all done that before.
6265687	eng	Tom said Mary is going to help us do that.
6265688	eng	Tom and I walked home together.
6265689	eng	We were in Boston together.
6265690	eng	Tom said Mary is going to do that herself.
6265691	eng	Tom and I tied for third place.
6265692	eng	We visited Boston together.
6265693	eng	Tom said Mary hasn't been very supportive.
6265694	eng	Tom and I talked all afternoon.
6265695	eng	We succeeded in doing that.
6265696	eng	Tom said Mary has never been to his house.
6265697	eng	Tom and I talked about the war.
6265698	eng	We regret coming to Boston.
6265699	eng	Tom said Mary has been waiting since 2:30.
6265700	eng	Tom and I stood close together.
6265701	eng	We really did go to Boston.
6265702	eng	Tom said Mary has been robbed three times.
6265703	eng	Tom and I still live in Boston.
6265704	eng	We need to do that by 2:30.
6265705	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't want to do that now.
6265706	eng	Tom and I stared at each other.
6265707	eng	We left the house together.
6265708	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound very surprised.
6265709	eng	Tom and I smiled at each other.
6265710	eng	We have to find a solution.
6265711	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound very confident.
6265712	eng	Tom and I seldom work together.
6265713	eng	We have a meeting tomorrow.
6265714	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have anything to eat.
6265715	eng	Tom and I sang a duet together.
6265716	eng	We go to Boston every year.
6265717	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have a place to stay.
6265718	eng	Tom and I reached an agreement.
6265719	eng	We didn't have enough time.
6265720	eng	Tom said Mary apologized for what she did.
6265721	eng	Tom and I often play billiards.
6265722	eng	We can't understand French.
6265723	eng	Tom said I shouldn't tell Mary to do that.
6265724	eng	Tom and I nodded to each other.
6265725	eng	We came to Boston together.
6265726	eng	Tom promised Mary that he'd quit drinking.
6265727	eng	Tom and I met three months ago.

6265982	eng	Tom was determined to do that.
6265983	eng	I'll eat when I get hungry.

6266024	eng	Tom told me you could do that.
6266025	eng	I wish to remain anonymous.
6266026	eng	Tom and Mary both live and work in Boston.
6266027	eng	Tom told me which book to buy.
6266028	eng	I wish I were still single.

6266045	eng	Tom told me that he's puzzled.
6266046	eng	I went to Boston for a job.
6266047	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary is going to be there.
6266048	eng	Tom told me that he's pleased.
6266049	eng	I went to Boston by myself.
6266050	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
6266051	eng	Tom told me that he's nervous.
6266052	eng	I wasn't wearing a uniform.
6266053	eng	Maybe Tom could talk Mary into doing that.
6266054	eng	Tom told me that he's jealous.
6266055	eng	I wasn't totally surprised.
6266056	eng	Maybe Tom can talk Mary out of doing that.
6266057	eng	Tom told me that he'd be fair.
6266058	eng	I wasn't telling the truth.
6266059	eng	I'd never heard Tom and Mary argue before.

6266061	eng	I wasn't seriously injured.
6266062	eng	I told Tom I didn't know where Mary lived.
6266063	eng	Tom told me that I'm forgiven.
6266064	eng	I wasn't here this morning.
6266065	eng	I think Tom didn't know Mary spoke French.
6266066	eng	Tom told me that I'm annoying.
6266067	eng	I wasn't at home yesterday.
6266068	eng	I should tell Tom I want him to help Mary.
6266069	eng	Tom told me his job was tough.
6266070	eng	I was too tired to do that.
6266071	eng	I saw Tom whisper something in Mary's ear.
6266072	eng	Tom told me he'd go to Boston.
6266073	eng	I was too drunk to do that.
6266074	eng	I know Tom will have to help Mary do that.
6266075	eng	Tom told me he was doing that.
6266076	eng	I was reluctant to do that.
6266077	eng	I don't want Tom to go shopping with Mary.
6266078	eng	Tom told me he visited Boston.
6266079	eng	I was permitted to do that.
6266080	eng	I don't know why Tom and Mary are arguing.
6266081	eng	Tom told me he studied French.
6266082	eng	I was annoyed by the smell.
6266083	eng	I didn't think Tom would let Mary do that.
6266084	eng	Tom told me he didn't do that.
6266085	eng	I was annoyed by the noise.
6266086	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's husband.
6266087	eng	Tom thought you would do that.
6266088	eng	I was able to visit Boston.
6266089	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's brother.
6266090	eng	Tom thought he should do that.
6266091	eng	I was able to go to Boston.
6266092	eng	Do you think Tom will permit Mary do that?
6266093	eng	Tom thought he had to do that.
6266094	eng	I wanted to try to do that.
6266095	eng	Do you know why Tom and Mary were arguing?

6266101	eng	Didn't you know Tom was younger than Mary?
6266102	eng	Tom sure studies French a lot.
6266103	eng	I wanted to get some sleep.
6266104	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were married?
6266105	eng	Tom sure goes to Boston a lot.
6266106	eng	I wanted to be your friend.
6266107	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary were an item?
6266108	eng	Tom suggested we visit Boston.
6266109	eng	I wanted to be cooperative.
6266110	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's girlfriend?
6266111	eng	Tom suggested we study French.
6266112	eng	I want you to study French.
6266113	eng	Could it have been Tom who told Mary that?
6266114	eng	Tom suggested we speak French.
6266115	eng	I want to set up a meeting.
6266116	eng	Why should Tom have Mary do that for him?
6266117	eng	Tom studied French last night.
6266118	eng	I want to see you upstairs.
6266119	eng	Wasn't Tom supposed to do that with Mary?
6266120	eng	Tom studied French in college.
6266121	eng	I want to return to Boston.
6266122	eng	Tom would like to know how Mary did that.
6266123	eng	Tom still sometimes does that.
6266124	eng	I want to repaint my house.
6266125	eng	Tom would be willing to do that for Mary.
6266126	eng	Tom still hasn't eaten dinner.
6266127	eng	I want to remain anonymous.
6266128	eng	Tom wondered who Mary wanted to help her.
6266129	eng	Tom still has to go to Boston.
6266130	eng	I want to pay off my debts.
6266131	eng	Tom wondered how Mary managed to do that.
6266132	eng	Tom still does that sometimes.
6266133	eng	I want to own a restaurant.
6266134	eng	Tom wondered how Mary learned to do that.
6266135	eng	Tom still does that every day.
6266136	eng	I want to eat here tonight.
6266137	eng	Tom won't permit Mary to do that anymore.
6266138	eng	Tom stays at home on weekends.
6266139	eng	I want to do that with you.
6266140	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he'll do that.
6266141	eng	Tom started out as a salesman.
6266142	eng	I want to do that tomorrow.
6266143	eng	Tom won't be able to get Mary to do that.
6266144	eng	Tom spoke with his supervisor.
6266145	eng	I want to come and see you.
6266146	eng	Tom will probably permit Mary to do that.
6266147	eng	Tom sometimes comes to Boston.
6266148	eng	I want to buy one of those.
6266149	eng	Tom will give Mary whatever she asks for.
6266150	eng	Tom signed up a long time ago.
6266151	eng	I want to become a surgeon.
6266152	eng	Tom will do whatever he can to help Mary.
6266153	eng	Tom shouldn't have left early.
6266154	eng	I want to become a fireman.
6266155	eng	Tom wasn't able to convince Mary do that.
6266156	eng	Tom shouldn't do that anymore.
6266157	eng	I want to be a firefighter.
6266158	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary to do that.
6266159	eng	Tom should've locked the door.
6266160	eng	I want to apologize to you.
6266161	eng	Tom was happy that Mary did that for him.
6266162	eng	Tom should've been suspicious.
6266163	eng	I use a computer every day.
6266164	eng	Tom was asleep by the time Mary got home.
6266165	eng	Tom should've been reasonable.
6266166	eng	I tried to remain unafraid.
6266167	eng	Tom was able to persuade Mary to do that.
6266168	eng	Tom should've been interested.
6266169	eng	I thought you weren't busy.
6266170	eng	Tom wanted to do that more than Mary did.
6266171	eng	Tom should've been helping us.
6266172	eng	I thought that I'd do that.
6266173	eng	Tom told Mary that he was ready to leave.
6266174	eng	Tom should've been handcuffed.
6266175	eng	I thought I had to do that.
6266176	eng	Tom told Mary that he was home on Monday.
6266177	eng	Tom should've been doing that.
6266178	eng	I think we need to do that.
6266179	eng	Tom told Mary that John wouldn't do that.
6266180	eng	Tom should do that right away.
6266181	eng	I think we have to do that.
6266182	eng	Tom told Mary she didn't have to do that.
6266183	eng	Tom should do that by himself.
6266184	eng	I think that I can do that.
6266185	eng	Tom told Mary not to look out the window.
6266186	eng	Tom should definitely do that.
6266187	eng	I think my new car is cool.
6266188	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted her to help John.
6266189	eng	Tom should cancel the meeting.
6266190	eng	I think it'll rain tonight.
6266191	eng	Tom thought Mary would forget to do that.
6266192	eng	Tom should be prepared by now.
6266193	eng	I think I'm going to be OK.
6266194	eng	Tom thought Mary would be retired by now.
6266195	eng	Tom should be done doing that.
6266196	eng	I think I'd better do that.
6266197	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't ready to do that.
6266198	eng	Tom should be asked to resign.
6266199	eng	I think I forgot something.
6266200	eng	Tom thought Mary wasn't doing that today.
6266201	eng	Tom seemed to want to do that.
6266202	eng	I switched the computer on.
6266203	eng	Tom thought Mary had finished doing that.
6266204	eng	Tom seemed dazed and confused.
6266205	eng	I suggest you visit Boston.
6266206	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't want to do that.
6266207	eng	Tom seemed confused and upset.
6266208	eng	I suggest you go to Boston.
6266209	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't need to do that.
6266210	eng	Tom says he's never done that.
6266211	eng	I should've told the truth.
6266212	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't have to do that.
6266213	eng	Tom says he'll call you later.
6266214	eng	I should've said something.
6266215	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't do that by herself.
6266216	eng	Tom says he'd love to do that.
6266217	eng	I should've hired a lawyer.
6266218	eng	Tom thinks Mary needs to be more careful.
6266219	eng	Tom says he'd like to do that.
6266220	eng	I should've asked for help.
6266221	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably at the beach.
6266222	eng	Tom says he wanted to do that.
6266223	eng	I should wait until Monday.
6266224	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't knows what to do.
6266225	eng	Tom says he shouldn't do that.
6266226	eng	I should visit Boston, too.
6266227	eng	Tom texted Mary to tell her he'd be late.
6266228	eng	Tom says he needs another car.
6266229	eng	I should go to Boston, too.
6266230	eng	Tom strongly advised Mary not to do that.
6266231	eng	Tom says he needed to do that.
6266232	eng	I should do that right now.
6266233	eng	Tom still wants Mary to help him do that.
6266234	eng	Tom says he likes his new job.
6266235	eng	I should do that by myself.
6266236	eng	Tom still doesn't know why Mary did that.
6266237	eng	Tom says he enjoys doing that.
6266238	eng	I should be home on Monday.
6266239	eng	Tom spent the whole day thinking of Mary.
6266240	eng	Tom says he can't do that yet.
6266241	eng	I should be given a chance.
6266242	eng	Tom soon realized he needed to help Mary.
6266243	eng	Tom says he can do that today.
6266244	eng	I should be doing that now.
6266245	eng	Tom showed Mary how to tie a square knot.
6266246	eng	Tom sat there for a long time.
6266247	eng	I rolled down both windows.
6266248	eng	Tom shouldn't tell Mary to go home early.
6266249	eng	Tom said you're a millionaire.
6266250	eng	I really, really want this.
6266251	eng	Tom shouldn't have asked Mary to do that.
6266252	eng	Tom said you wouldn't do that.
6266253	eng	I really didn't understand.
6266254	eng	Tom should've given Mary what she wanted.
6266255	eng	Tom said the concert was good.
6266256	eng	I never learned to do that.
6266257	eng	Tom should tell Mary what she has to buy.
6266258	eng	Tom said that he wasn't upset.
6266259	eng	I never do that on Mondays.
6266260	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he wants to do.
6266261	eng	Tom said that he wasn't tired.
6266262	eng	I need to talk to a lawyer.
6266263	eng	Tom should tell Mary what has to be done.
6266264	eng	Tom said that he wasn't happy.
6266265	eng	I need to start doing that.
6266266	eng	Tom should tell Mary he wants to do that.
6266267	eng	Tom said that he wasn't bored.
6266268	eng	I need to do that tomorrow.
6266269	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary to do that.
6266270	eng	Tom said that he spoke French.
6266271	eng	I need to be there by 2:30.
6266272	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's tired.
6266273	eng	Tom said something about that.
6266274	eng	I need to be ready by 2:30.
6266275	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's sorry.
6266276	eng	Tom said it was time to leave.
6266277	eng	I need to be here tomorrow.
6266278	eng	Tom should give Mary a chance to do that.
6266279	eng	Tom said it didn't bother him.
6266280	eng	I need to apply for a visa.
6266281	eng	Tom seems to be aware that Mary did that.
6266282	eng	Tom said his house was locked.
6266283	eng	I need a couple of dollars.
6266284	eng	Tom says that Mary would like to do that.
6266285	eng	Tom said he's very happy here.
6266286	eng	I may have to study French.
6266287	eng	Tom says that Mary is good at doing that.
6266288	eng	Tom said he's never done that.
6266289	eng	I may have to go to Boston.
6266290	eng	Tom says he knows Mary wanted to do that.
6266291	eng	Tom said he'll do that for us.
6266292	eng	I love the way you do that.
6266293	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary enjoys doing that.
6266294	eng	Tom said he'd take care of it.
6266295	eng	I looked up at the ceiling.
6266296	eng	Tom says he doesn't want to talk to Mary.
6266297	eng	Tom said he'd see me tomorrow.
6266298	eng	I looked down the corridor.
6266299	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary does that.
6266300	eng	Tom said he'd quit doing that.
6266301	eng	I looked down at the floor.
6266302	eng	Tom says Mary never came home last night.
6266303	eng	Tom said he'd help us do that.
6266304	eng	I looked at the fuel gauge.
6266305	eng	Tom says Mary isn't the one who did that.
6266306	eng	Tom said he'd do that for you.
6266307	eng	I looked at my watch again.
6266308	eng	Tom says Mary isn't permitted to do that.
6266309	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be there.
6266310	eng	I live in a small bungalow.
6266311	eng	Tom said that Mary would like to do that.
6266312	eng	Tom said he wasn't overweight.
6266313	eng	I like the way you do that.
6266314	eng	Tom said that Mary won't do that anymore.
6266315	eng	Tom said he wasn't having fun.
6266316	eng	I know you'll need my help.
6266317	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't very impressed.
6266318	eng	Tom said he was very confused.
6266319	eng	I know you'd never do that.
6266320	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't having any fun.
6266321	eng	Tom said he was feeling tired.
6266322	eng	I know you want to do that.
6266323	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't careful enough.
6266324	eng	Tom said he understood French.
6266325	eng	I know you need to do that.
6266326	eng	Tom said that Mary wanted to talk to you.
6266327	eng	Tom said he shouldn't do that.
6266328	eng	I know you have to do that.
6266329	eng	Tom said that Mary had fun at your party.
6266330	eng	Tom said he heard three shots.
6266331	eng	I know why you got annoyed.
6266332	eng	Tom said it was Mary who stole his lunch.
6266333	eng	Tom said he enjoys doing that.
6266334	eng	I know where your house is.
6266335	eng	Tom said he's sure Mary needs to do that.
6266336	eng	Tom said he didn't have a job.

6266338	eng	Tom said he's never seen Mary doing that.
6266339	eng	Tom said he didn't have a dog.
6266340	eng	I know what my mistake was.
6266341	eng	Tom said he's never been to Mary's house.
6266342	eng	Tom said I wasn't good enough.
6266343	eng	I know what it's all about.
6266344	eng	Tom said he'd do that for Mary this time.
6266345	eng	Tom said I needed to be quiet.
6266346	eng	I know what I'm up against.
6266347	eng	Tom said he wished he hadn't kissed Mary.
6266348	eng	Tom said I looked very sleepy.
6266349	eng	I know this isn't any good.
6266350	eng	Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that.

6266364	eng	I know that I was mistaken.
6266365	eng	Tom said he knows one of Mary's brothers.
6266366	eng	Tom rarely ever speaks French.
6266367	eng	I know not to do that here.
6266368	eng	Tom said he knew why Mary had to do that.
6266369	eng	Tom ran down the street naked.
6266370	eng	I know it's more than that.

6266376	eng	I know how to ride a horse.
6266377	eng	Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
6266378	eng	Tom promised he won't do that.
6266379	eng	I know how much it'll cost.
6266380	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary does that.
6266381	eng	Tom probably isn't hungry yet.
6266382	eng	I know exactly who you are.
6266383	eng	Tom said he doesn't know where Mary went.
6266384	eng	Tom probably isn't afraid now.

6266398	eng	Tom said Mary's comments were misleading.
6266399	eng	Tom plans to return to Boston.
6266400	eng	I know I'd hate to do that.
6266401	eng	Tom said Mary would do that if she could.

6266412	eng	I knew I was being watched.
6266413	eng	Tom said Mary was sorry for what she did.

6266436	eng	I hardly ever study French.
6266437	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be incorrect.
6266438	eng	Tom must've wanted to do that.
6266439	eng	I had to do that yesterday.
6266440	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be impressed.
6266441	eng	Tom must be afraid to do that.
6266442	eng	I had no reason to do that.

6266854	eng	I think Tom won't go to Boston with Mary.
6266855	eng	Tom had a very difficult year.
6266856	eng	Do you want to do that now?
6266857	eng	I think Tom will be doing that with Mary.
6266858	eng	Tom got up earlier than usual.
6266859	eng	Do you still eat junk food?
6266860	eng	I shouldn't tell Tom about what Mary did.
6266861	eng	Tom got the chance to do that.
6266862	eng	Do you need an interpreter?
6266863	eng	I hope Tom can teach Mary how to do that.
6266864	eng	Tom got stopped by the police.
6266865	eng	Do you live in Boston, too?
6266866	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary would do that.
6266867	eng	Tom got out of jail on Monday.
6266868	eng	Do you know those children?
6266869	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary won't do that.
6266870	eng	Tom got more than he expected.
6266871	eng	Do you know the exact date?
6266872	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary can't do that.
6266873	eng	Tom frequently goes to Boston.
6266874	eng	Do you know that gentleman?
6266875	eng	I didn't tell Tom why I didn't like Mary.
6266876	eng	Tom forgave me for doing that.
6266877	eng	Do you drink a lot of wine?
6266878	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my girlfriend.
6266879	eng	Tom forced himself to do that.
6266880	eng	Do you drink a lot of beer?
6266881	eng	I didn't realize Tom was married to Mary.
6266882	eng	Tom felt compelled to do that.
6266883	eng	Do you always speak French?
6266884	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's nephew.
6266885	eng	Tom enjoys going to the beach.
6266886	eng	Do we have to study French?
6266887	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's father.
6266888	eng	Tom doesn't want to be lonely.
6266889	eng	Do we have to speak French?
6266890	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's cousin.
6266891	eng	Tom doesn't think I'd do that.
6266892	eng	Do we have to go to Boston?
6266893	eng	How did Tom know Mary would be in Boston?
6266894	eng	Tom doesn't teach French here.
6266895	eng	Do that as fast as you can.
6266896	eng	Do you know why Tom and Mary are arguing?
6266897	eng	Tom doesn't study French much.
6266898	eng	Didn't you know what to do?
6266899	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was dating Mary?
6266900	eng	Tom doesn't study French here.
6266901	eng	Didn't you know about this?
6266902	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's boyfriend?
6266903	eng	Tom doesn't speak French much.
6266904	eng	Did you eat an apple today?
6266905	eng	You should tell Tom Mary has to do that.
6266906	eng	Tom doesn't regret doing that.
6266907	eng	Can you sleep on airplanes?
6266908	eng	Why would Tom have Mary do that for him?
6266909	eng	Tom doesn't like to wear ties.
6266910	eng	Can you give me any advice?
6266911	eng	Tom would be surprised if Mary did that.
6266912	eng	Tom doesn't like cold weather.
6266913	eng	Can you float on your back?
6266914	eng	Tom would be impressed if Mary did that.
6266915	eng	Tom doesn't know who did that.
6266916	eng	Can you draw pictures well?
6266917	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was wearing black.
6266918	eng	Tom doesn't know what love is.
6266919	eng	Are you still a vegetarian?
6266920	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wanted to do that.
6266921	eng	Tom doesn't have many options.
6266922	eng	Are you obliged to do that?
6266923	eng	Tom wondered why Mary needed to do that.
6266924	eng	Tom doesn't have any problems.
6266925	eng	Are you nervous doing that?
6266926	eng	Tom wondered what Mary was going to buy.
6266927	eng	Tom doesn't do that very well.
6266928	eng	Are you likely to go there?
6266929	eng	Tom will probably tell Mary he's sleepy.
6266930	eng	Tom doesn't do that very much.
6266931	eng	Are you afraid to go there?
6266932	eng	Tom will give Mary everything she wants.
6266933	eng	Tom doesn't do that regularly.
6266934	eng	Yours is larger than mine.
6266935	eng	Tom will give Mary everything she needs.
6266936	eng	Tom doesn't appear to be busy.
6266937	eng	Your suitcases look heavy.
6266938	eng	Tom wasn't surprised when Mary did that.
6266939	eng	Tom does that when he's tired.
6266940	eng	Your shoelaces are untied.
6266941	eng	Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did that.
6266942	eng	Tom does that when he's happy.
6266943	eng	Your resume is impressive.
6266944	eng	Tom was the one who helped Mary do that.
6266945	eng	Tom does that when he's drunk.
6266946	eng	Your plan seemed the best.
6266947	eng	Tom was quicker at doing that than Mary.
6266948	eng	Tom does that every other day.
6266949	eng	Your plan actually worked.
6266950	eng	Tom warned Mary not to be overconfident.
6266951	eng	Tom didn't want me to do that.
6266952	eng	Your performance was good.
6266953	eng	Tom wanted to go to the dance with Mary.
6266954	eng	Tom didn't seem too impressed.
6266955	eng	Your name was on the list.
6266956	eng	Tom wanted me to go to Boston with Mary.
6266957	eng	Tom didn't seem to be unhappy.
6266958	eng	Your jokes were offensive.
6266959	eng	Tom told Mary why he enjoyed doing that.
6266960	eng	Tom didn't react quick enough.
6266961	eng	Your dog swims quite well.
6266962	eng	Tom told Mary that she was being unfair.
6266963	eng	Tom didn't plan on doing that.
6266964	eng	Your boots are very muddy.
6266965	eng	Tom told Mary that he had been punished.
6266966	eng	Tom didn't get what he needed.
6266967	eng	Your birthday's coming up.
6266968	eng	Tom told Mary that John was unconscious.
6266969	eng	Tom didn't do that on purpose.
6266970	eng	Your answers were correct.
6266971	eng	Tom told Mary that John was incompetent.
6266972	eng	Tom didn't do that by himself.
6266973	eng	Your French is quite good.
6266974	eng	Tom told Mary that John was his brother.
6266975	eng	Tom did what he planned to do.
6266976	eng	You've been a naughty boy.
6266977	eng	Tom told Mary not to do that, didn't he?
6266978	eng	Tom did that without our help.
6266979	eng	You're too young to drink.
6266980	eng	Tom told Mary how to do that, didn't he?
6266981	eng	Tom did that enthusiastically.
6266982	eng	You're too young for that.
6266983	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't do that again.
6266984	eng	Tom did that better this time.
6266985	eng	You're too shy to do that.
6266986	eng	Tom told Mary he wasn't able to do that.
6266987	eng	Tom did that again, didn't he?
6266988	eng	You're too old to do that.
6266989	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted to quit his job.
6266990	eng	Tom did almost the same thing.
6266991	eng	You're stingy, aren't you?
6266992	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want to do that.
6266993	eng	Tom definitely has to do that.
6266994	eng	You're driving too slowly.
6266995	eng	Tom thought Mary would be in her office.
6266996	eng	Tom definitely had to do that.
6266997	eng	You're dressed too warmly.
6266998	eng	Tom thought Mary was through doing that.
6266999	eng	Tom decided to go there alone.
6267000	eng	You're crying, aren't you?
6267001	eng	Tom thought Mary was nervous doing that.
6267002	eng	Tom cut a branch off the tree.
6267003	eng	You're a very wise person.
6267004	eng	Tom thought Mary probably would do that.
6267005	eng	Tom couldn't make you do that.
6267006	eng	You're a very hard worker.
6267007	eng	Tom thinks Mary wouldn't likely do that.
6267008	eng	Tom could've done that better.
6267009	eng	You're a very good friend.
6267010	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't help John do that.
6267011	eng	Tom could've been back sooner.
6267012	eng	You're a very good driver.
6267013	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't forget to do that.
6267014	eng	Tom could pass for a teenager.
6267015	eng	You're a very good bowler.
6267016	eng	Tom thinks Mary won't be home on Monday.
6267017	eng	Tom could easily have said no.
6267018	eng	You're a very good batter.
6267019	eng	Tom thinks Mary will do that by herself.
6267020	eng	Tom could do that if he tried.
6267021	eng	You're a very fussy eater.
6267022	eng	Tom thinks Mary probably didn't do that.
6267023	eng	Tom could be tried for murder.
6267024	eng	You're a very fast runner.
6267025	eng	Tom thinks Mary might not be interested.
6267026	eng	Tom complained about the cold.
6267027	eng	You're a tough competitor.
6267028	eng	Tom thinks Mary is reluctant to do that.
6267029	eng	Tom claims he was brainwashed.
6267030	eng	You're a terrible manager.
6267031	eng	Tom thinks Mary is motivated to do that.
6267032	eng	Tom claimed he didn't do that.
6267033	eng	You're a really smart guy.
6267034	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't know what to do.
6267035	eng	Tom can probably speak French.
6267036	eng	You're a real hard worker.
6267037	eng	Tom thinks Mary doesn't have to do that.
6267038	eng	Tom can do that with one hand.
6267039	eng	You're a real good friend.
6267040	eng	Tom thinks Mary can't understand French.
6267041	eng	Tom came out of the room last.
6267042	eng	You're a pretty tough kid.
6267043	eng	Tom talked Mary out of quitting her job.
6267044	eng	Tom believes he could do that.
6267045	eng	You're a pretty smart kid.
6267046	eng	Tom talked Mary into doing that for him.
6267047	eng	Tom asked me what time it was.
6267048	eng	You're a good bass player.
6267049	eng	Tom still has no idea why Mary did that.
6267050	eng	Tom asked if we had done that.
6267051	eng	You'll help us, won't you?
6267052	eng	Tom spent his summer vacation with Mary.
6267053	eng	Tom asked if he could do that.
6267054	eng	You'll do that, won't you?
6267055	eng	Tom showed Mary various ways to do that.
6267056	eng	Tom apparently has to do that.
6267057	eng	You'd be pleased, I think.
6267058	eng	Tom showed Mary several ways to do that.
6267059	eng	Tom apparently had to do that.
6267060	eng	You'd be crazy to do that.
6267061	eng	Tom showed Mary how to play the G chord.
6267062	eng	Tom and I'll do that together.
6267063	eng	You won't have to do that.
6267064	eng	Tom shouldn't have told Mary to do that.
6267065	eng	Tom and I were here yesterday.
6267066	eng	You want a job, don't you?
6267067	eng	Tom should've shown Mary how to do that.
6267068	eng	Tom and I waved to each other.
6267069	eng	You still need to do that.
6267070	eng	Tom should've given Mary his old guitar.
6267071	eng	Tom and I want to talk to you.
6267072	eng	You still have to do that.
6267073	eng	Tom should tell Mary what he has to buy.
6267074	eng	Tom and I want to get married.
6267075	eng	You shouldn't do that yet.
6267076	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to be so noisy.
6267077	eng	Tom and I want to do that now.
6267078	eng	You should come to Boston.
6267079	eng	Tom should tell Mary he'd never do that.
6267080	eng	Tom and I talked about sports.
6267081	eng	You sell used cars, right?
6267082	eng	Tom should tell Mary he won't leave her.
6267083	eng	Tom and I splashed each other.
6267084	eng	You seem to be very upset.
6267085	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary he's busy.
6267086	eng	Tom and I soon became friends.
6267087	eng	You say that I'll do that.
6267088	eng	Tom should ask Mary to help him do that.
6267089	eng	Tom and I rarely eat together.
6267090	eng	You say I'd never do that.
6267091	eng	Tom seems to know what Mary wants to do.
6267092	eng	Tom and I quarrel quite often.
6267093	eng	You read a lot, don't you?
6267094	eng	Tom seems to know what Mary needs to do.
6267095	eng	Tom and I often work together.
6267096	eng	You play piano, don't you?
6267097	eng	Tom seemed surprised when Mary did that.
6267098	eng	Tom and I often sing together.
6267099	eng	You ought to visit Boston.
6267100	eng	Tom says he'd never ask Mary to do that.
6267101	eng	Tom and I often dine together.
6267102	eng	You ought to go to Boston.
6267103	eng	Tom says he won't tell Mary what we did.
6267104	eng	Tom and I need to do that now.
6267105	eng	You need to do that again.
6267106	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary really did that.
6267107	eng	Tom and I met three years ago.
6267108	eng	You need money to do that.
6267109	eng	Tom says he heard that Mary wanted help.
6267110	eng	Tom and I have to do that now.
6267111	eng	You must not do that here.
6267112	eng	Tom says he heard that Mary needed help.
6267113	eng	Tom and I have started dating.
6267114	eng	You must do that tomorrow.
6267115	eng	Tom says he heard Mary tapping her foot.
6267116	eng	Tom and I had an ugly divorce.
6267117	eng	You may do that right now.
6267118	eng	Tom says he expects Mary to participate.
6267119	eng	Tom and I got married in 2013.
6267120	eng	You look very happy today.
6267121	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary did that.
6267122	eng	Tom and I got along very well.
6267123	eng	You look very comfortable.
6267124	eng	Tom says he can't believe Mary did that.
6267125	eng	Tom and I get along very well.
6267126	eng	You look totally confused.
6267127	eng	Tom said that Mary was living in Boston.
6267128	eng	Tom and I drank beer together.
6267129	eng	You look pretty shaken up.
6267130	eng	Tom said that Mary was enjoying herself.
6267131	eng	Tom and I don't want children.
6267132	eng	You look pretty miserable.
6267133	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be unhappy.
6267134	eng	Tom and I don't often do that.
6267135	eng	You look old for your age.
6267136	eng	Tom said that Mary needed to be careful.
6267137	eng	Tom and I don't have children.
6267138	eng	You look better this week.
6267139	eng	Tom said he's glad Mary didn't get hurt.
6267140	eng	Tom and I despised each other.
6267141	eng	You look a little worried.
6267142	eng	Tom said he'd expected Mary to help him.
6267143	eng	Tom and I decided to break up.
6267144	eng	You look a little nervous.
6267145	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to Mary's concert.
6267146	eng	Tom and I couldn't be happier.
6267147	eng	You look a little flushed.
6267148	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't at home.
6267149	eng	Tom and I can't both be right.
6267150	eng	You look a little annoyed.
6267151	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was mad at him.
6267152	eng	Tom and I broke up last month.
6267153	eng	You live alone, don't you?
6267154	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was having fun.
6267155	eng	Tom and I ate dinner together.
6267156	eng	You like fruit, don't you?
6267157	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was happy here.
6267158	eng	Tom and I are waiting for you.
6267159	eng	You like chili, don't you?

6267161	eng	Tom and I are the same height.
6267162	eng	You like chess, don't you?

6267165	eng	You know a lot, don't you?
6267166	eng	Tom said he knew what Mary needed to do.
6267167	eng	Tom and I are still in Boston.
6267168	eng	You have to do that today.
6267169	eng	Tom said he knew one of Mary's brothers.
6267170	eng	Tom and I are always fighting.
6267171	eng	You hate women, don't you?
6267172	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary wouldn't do that.
6267173	eng	Tom and I are almost finished.
6267174	eng	You got drunk, didn't you?
6267175	eng	Tom said he heard Mary and John arguing.
6267176	eng	Tom always seems to be sleepy.
6267177	eng	You fell down, didn't you?
6267178	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary did that.
6267179	eng	Tom always seems to be scared.
6267180	eng	You drink wine, don't you?
6267181	eng	Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
6267182	eng	Tom always seems to be hungry.
6267183	eng	You drink beer, don't you?
6267184	eng	Tom said Mary wouldn't enjoy doing that.
6267185	eng	Tom always seems to be absent.
6267186	eng	You don't do that, do you?
6267187	eng	Tom said Mary would very likely do that.
6267188	eng	Tom almost did that yesterday.
6267189	eng	You don't do that anymore.
6267190	eng	Tom said Mary would most likely do that.
6267191	eng	Tom agreed to help us do that.
6267192	eng	You did that very quickly.
6267193	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't willing to do that.
6267194	eng	Tom admits he often does that.
6267195	eng	You did that the hard way.
6267196	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't tempted to do that.
6267197	eng	Tom actually tried to do that.
6267198	eng	You could buy that for us.
6267199	eng	Tom said Mary was very unlikely to do that.
6267200	eng	Tom actually did that himself.
6267201	eng	You can stay if I want to.
6267202	eng	Tom said Mary was too stupid to do that.
6267203	eng	Tom's speech was very boring.
6267204	eng	You always win, don't you?
6267205	eng	Tom said Mary was too sleepy to do that.
6267206	eng	Tom's performance wasn't bad.
6267207	eng	Would you mind doing that?
6267208	eng	Tom said Mary was told to do that again.
6267209	eng	Tom's office isn't like mine.
6267210	eng	Would you help me, please?
6267211	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to still be up.
6267212	eng	Tom's friends still miss him.
6267213	eng	Women aren't allowed here.
6267214	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be unafraid.
6267215	eng	Tom's condition has improved.
6267216	eng	Will you do that tomorrow?
6267217	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be punctual.
6267218	eng	Tom's comments made me laugh.
6267219	eng	Will you do that sometime?
6267220	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be mistaken.
6267221	eng	Tom would be able to do that.
6267222	eng	Why should I visit Boston?
6267223	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be confused.
6267224	eng	Tom works at the post office.
6267225	eng	Why should I speak French?
6267226	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be careless.
6267227	eng	Tom won't promise to do that.
6267228	eng	Why don't you relax a bit?
6267229	eng	Tom said Mary was likely to be arrested.
6267230	eng	Tom won't likely be truthful.
6267231	eng	Why did you shut the door?
6267232	eng	Tom said Mary was just about to do that.
6267233	eng	Tom won't likely be punished.
6267234	eng	Why did that surprise you?
6267235	eng	Tom said Mary was determined to do that.
6267236	eng	Tom won't likely be punctual.
6267237	eng	Why did that interest you?
6267238	eng	Tom said Mary should do that by herself.
6267239	eng	Tom won't likely be prepared.
6267240	eng	Why can't we speak French?
6267241	eng	Tom said Mary sang very well last night.
6267242	eng	Tom won't likely be forgiven.
6267243	eng	Why can't we go to Boston?
6267244	eng	Tom said Mary probably wouldn't do that.
6267245	eng	Tom won't likely be done yet.
6267246	eng	Why are you in Boston now?
6267247	eng	Tom said Mary probably couldn't do that.
6267248	eng	Tom won't likely be confused.
6267249	eng	Who's that guy over there?
6267250	eng	Tom said Mary needed to be more careful.
6267251	eng	Tom won't likely be careless.
6267252	eng	Who's supposed to do that?
6267253	eng	Tom said Mary looked like she was happy.
6267254	eng	Tom won't likely be arrested.
6267255	eng	Who's helping your mother?
6267256	eng	Tom said Mary isn't hesitant to do that.
6267257	eng	Tom won't do that by himself.
6267258	eng	Who was here this morning?
6267259	eng	Tom said Mary isn't finished doing that.
6267260	eng	Tom won't do that any longer.
6267261	eng	Who should I do that with?
6267262	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still thirsty.
6267263	eng	Tom won't ask you to do that.
6267264	eng	Who picked all the grapes?
6267265	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still puzzled.
6267266	eng	Tom will probably be unlucky.
6267267	eng	Where's the nearest beach?
6267268	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still outside.
6267269	eng	Tom will probably be thirsty.
6267270	eng	What'll we do if it rains?
6267271	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still nervous.
6267272	eng	Tom will probably be nervous.
6267273	eng	What you're doing is good.
6267274	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still jealous.
6267275	eng	Tom will probably be furious.
6267276	eng	What did you do on Monday?
6267277	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
6267278	eng	Tom will probably be elected.
6267279	eng	What color is your new car?
6267280	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still excited.
6267281	eng	Tom will probably be curious.
6267282	eng	What are you listening to?
6267283	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still at home.
6267284	eng	Tom will most likely do that.
6267285	eng	We're looking for options.
6267286	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at cooking.
6267287	eng	Tom will likely be terrified.
6267288	eng	We'll go to Boston by car.
6267289	eng	Tom said Mary is always lived in Boston.
6267290	eng	Tom will likely be suspended.
6267291	eng	We were forced to do that.
6267292	eng	Tom said Mary has to do that by herself.
6267293	eng	Tom will likely be surprised.
6267294	eng	We speak French every day.
6267295	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John's dog.
6267296	eng	Tom will likely be skeptical.
6267297	eng	We seldom do that anymore.
6267298	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen John dance.
6267299	eng	Tom will likely be impressed.
6267300	eng	We plan to attack at dawn.
6267301	eng	Tom said Mary has never met his parents.
6267302	eng	Tom will likely be here soon.
6267303	eng	We often listen to Mozart.
6267304	eng	Tom said Mary has been told not do that.
6267305	eng	Tom will likely be exhausted.
6267306	eng	We don't have tickets yet.
6267307	eng	Tom said Mary has been to Boston before.
6267308	eng	Tom will likely be concerned.
6267309	eng	We could buy that for you.
6267310	eng	Tom said Mary has been asked to do that.
6267311	eng	Tom will likely be back soon.
6267312	eng	We can't go to Boston yet.
6267313	eng	Tom said Mary had to do that by herself.
6267314	eng	Tom will likely be awake now.
6267315	eng	We can't go to Boston now.
6267316	eng	Tom probably doesn't know where Mary is.
6267317	eng	Tom will do that if possible.
6267318	eng	We agreed to speak French.
6267319	eng	Tom probably doesn't know Mary did that.
6267320	eng	Tom will come this week, too.
6267321	eng	We agreed to go to Boston.
6267322	eng	Tom often does the same thing Mary does.
6267323	eng	Tom will be glad he did that.
6267324	eng	Was yesterday a sunny day?
6267325	eng	Tom must've thought Mary had to do that.
6267326	eng	Tom will be awake in an hour.
6267327	eng	This is my neighbor's dog.
6267328	eng	Tom likes the way Mary plays the guitar.
6267329	eng	Tom went out to get some air.
6267330	eng	This is an excellent wine.
6267331	eng	Tom let Mary know that he had done that.
6267332	eng	Tom wasn't really good to me.
6267333	eng	This is a tough situation.
6267334	eng	Tom knows Mary won't be able to do that.
6267335	eng	Tom wasn't afraid to do that.
6267336	eng	This is a comfortable bed.
6267337	eng	Tom knows Mary no longer has to do that.
6267338	eng	Tom was wounded and captured.
6267339	eng	This is a bad translation.
6267340	eng	Tom isn't as young as Mary thinks he is.
6267341	eng	Tom was sleeping on the sofa.
6267342	eng	They say it gets hot here.
6267343	eng	Tom informed Mary why he had to do that.
6267344	eng	Tom was permitted to do that.
6267345	eng	They live in another city.
6267346	eng	Tom hopes that Mary won't do that again.
6267347	eng	Tom was motivated to do that.
6267348	eng	They don't want to see me.
6267349	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she should do.
6267350	eng	Tom was helping us with that.
6267351	eng	These things belong to me.
6267352	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows what she has to do.
6267353	eng	Tom was fired for doing that.
6267354	eng	These glasses aren't mine.
6267355	eng	Tom has told Mary to do that by herself.
6267356	eng	Tom was doing that yesterday.
6267357	eng	These don't belong to me.
6267358	eng	Tom has spoken to Mary about the matter.
6267359	eng	Tom was desperate to do that.
6267360	eng	The sun rises in the east.
6267361	eng	Tom has said he won't help Mary anymore.
6267362	eng	Tom was charged with perjury.
6267363	eng	The snow isn't letting up.
6267364	eng	Tom has known Mary for a very long time.
6267365	eng	Tom was certainly not amused.
6267366	eng	The lake is far from here.
6267367	eng	Tom has done what Mary wanted him to do.
6267368	eng	Tom warned me not to do that.
6267369	eng	That's what I want to eat.
6267370	eng	Tom has advised Mary to stop doing that.
6267371	eng	Tom wants to buy another car.
6267372	eng	That's what I want to buy.
6267373	eng	Tom has a lot more books than Mary does.
6267374	eng	Tom wants me to study French.
6267375	eng	That seems to be the plan.
6267376	eng	Tom has Mary to show him how to do that.
6267377	eng	Tom very seldom has homework.
6267378	eng	Stop doing that right now.
6267379	eng	Tom had a hunch that Mary would do that.
6267380	eng	Tom usually seems to do that.
6267381	eng	Please don't do that here.
6267382	eng	Tom explicitly told Mary not to do that.
6267383	eng	Tom usually keeps to himself.
6267384	eng	Please do that if you can.
6267385	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would be jealous.
6267386	eng	Tom usually does that for us.
6267387	eng	People here don't do that.
6267388	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be stubborn.
6267389	eng	Tom usually does that for me.
6267390	eng	Our flight leaves at 2:30.
6267391	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be punctual.
6267392	eng	Tom used to enjoy doing that.
6267393	eng	Our company is in trouble.
6267394	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be confused.
6267395	eng	Tom used to dance quite well.
6267396	eng	One of you has to do that.
6267397	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be careless.
6267398	eng	Tom urged me to study French.
6267399	eng	One of my cats is missing.
6267400	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary wants to do that.
6267401	eng	Tom tried to win the contest.
6267402	eng	Now's the time to do that.
6267403	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary ought to do that.
6267404	eng	Tom took the lid off the box.
6267405	eng	None of them will do that.
6267406	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary needs to do that.
6267407	eng	Tom told us he would do that.
6267408	eng	Nobody thought about that.
6267409	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary meant to do that.
6267410	eng	Tom told us he couldn't help.
6267411	eng	No issue is a small issue.
6267412	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary knows what to do.
6267413	eng	Tom told us he could do that.
6267414	eng	My parents have separated.
6267415	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is going to do that.
6267416	eng	Tom told me that he's sleepy.
6267417	eng	My life is back to normal.
6267418	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary does that.
6267419	eng	Tom told me that he's scared.
6267420	eng	My favorite food is pizza.
6267421	eng	Tom doesn't like science, but Mary does.
6267422	eng	Tom told me that he's lonely.
6267423	eng	My father was a policeman.
6267424	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary would do that.
6267425	eng	Tom told me that he's afraid.
6267426	eng	My family lives in Boston.
6267427	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary is doing that.
6267428	eng	Tom told me he would do that.
6267429	eng	My family is here with me.
6267430	eng	Tom doesn't know who taught Mary French.
6267431	eng	Tom told me he won't do that.
6267432	eng	My dog still bites people.
6267433	eng	Tom didn't understand why Mary did that.
6267434	eng	Tom told me I should do that.
6267435	eng	My confidence is wavering.
6267436	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be punctual.
6267437	eng	Tom thought he could help us.
6267438	eng	My computer isn't working.
6267439	eng	Tom didn't tell me Mary was his ex-wife.
6267440	eng	Tom thinks he's good-looking.
6267441	eng	My car's parked out front.
6267442	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what she has to do.
6267443	eng	Tom thinks he should do that.
6267444	eng	My car is in the driveway.
6267445	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he has to buy.
6267446	eng	Tom thinks I know what to do.
6267447	eng	My car has been impounded.
6267448	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he had to buy.
6267449	eng	Tom thinks I have to do that.
6267450	eng	My boss is very demanding.
6267451	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary had to do that.
6267452	eng	Tom swore he'd never do that.
6267453	eng	My birthday was yesterday.
6267454	eng	Tom didn't do what Mary asked him to do.
6267455	eng	Tom swears he didn't do that.
6267456	eng	Monday will be a cold day.
6267457	eng	Tom did what he could to calm Mary down.
6267458	eng	Tom sure has done a good job.
6267459	eng	Monday will be a busy day.
6267460	eng	Tom denied that he told Mary to do that.
6267461	eng	Tom suggested we leave early.
6267462	eng	Make sure you do that, OK?
6267463	eng	Tom believed that Mary wouldn't do that.
6267464	eng	Tom still refuses to do that.
6267465	eng	Let's take a little break.
6267466	eng	Tom believed that Mary couldn't do that.
6267467	eng	Tom still hasn't answered me.
6267468	eng	Let's go out on the porch.
6267469	eng	Tom asked if Mary really had to do that.
6267470	eng	Tom still can't speak French.
6267471	eng	Let them buy that for you.
6267472	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to work late.
6267473	eng	Tom started out as a janitor.
6267474	eng	It's your turn to do that.
6267475	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't like John.
6267476	eng	Tom started out as a drummer.
6267477	eng	Tom asked Mary why he needed to do that.
6267478	eng	Tom spoke very highly of you.
6267479	eng	It's way past my bed time.
6267480	eng	Tom asked Mary where she wanted to work.
6267481	eng	Tom sold his house last week.
6267482	eng	It's too early to do that.
6267483	eng	Tom asked Mary where she parked the car.
6267484	eng	Tom should've been terrified.
6267485	eng	It's necessary to do that.
6267486	eng	Tom asked Mary what kind of car she had.
6267487	eng	Tom should've been suspended.
6267488	eng	It's important to do that.
6267489	eng	Tom asked Mary if she'd like to do that.
6267490	eng	Tom should've been surprised.
6267491	eng	It's humid here in Boston.
6267492	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that.
6267493	eng	Tom should've been skeptical.
6267494	eng	It's foggy here in Boston.
6267495	eng	Tom asked Mary if she needed to do that.
6267496	eng	Tom should've been impressed.
6267497	eng	It's dangerous to do that.
6267498	eng	Tom asked Mary if she knew who John was.
6267499	eng	Tom should've been a teacher.
6267500	eng	It's almost time to leave.
6267501	eng	Tom and Mary like the same kind of food.
6267502	eng	Tom should wait until Monday.
6267503	eng	It's all right to do that.
6267504	eng	Tom and Mary have several grandchildren.
6267505	eng	Tom should do that right now.
6267506	eng	It'll be risky to do that.
6267507	eng	Tom and Mary aren't supposed to do that.
6267508	eng	Tom should be retired by now.
6267509	eng	It'll be cheap to do that.
6267510	eng	Tom and I sat across from John and Mary.
6267511	eng	Tom should be home on Monday.
6267512	eng	It wasn't me who did that.
6267513	eng	Tom and I are in the same class as Mary.
6267514	eng	Tom should be doing that now.
6267515	eng	It was too hot to do that.
6267516	eng	Tom and I are here to help Mary do that.
6267517	eng	Tom should be asked to leave.
6267518	eng	It costs money to do that.
6267519	eng	Tom and I are both Mary's ex-boyfriends.
6267520	eng	Tom seldom gets here on time.
6267521	eng	Is it humid now in Boston?
6267522	eng	Tom advised Mary to go there by bicycle.
6267523	eng	Tom seldom forgot to do that.
6267524	eng	Is it foggy now in Boston?
6267525	eng	Tom admits that he stole Mary's jewelry.
6267526	eng	Tom seems to want to do that.
6267527	eng	I've only done that twice.
6267528	eng	The one who helped Tom do that was Mary.
6267529	eng	Tom seems to like doing that.
6267530	eng	I've never done that here.
6267531	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary did that yesterday.
6267532	eng	Tom seems to be feeling fine.
6267533	eng	I've just spent three hours studying French.
6267534	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know why Mary is here.
6267535	eng	Tom seemed to be very sleepy.
6267536	eng	I've decided to volunteer.
6267537	eng	Maybe Tom can talk Mary into doing that.
6267538	eng	Tom seemed to be very hungry.
6267539	eng	I've decided not to leave.
6267540	eng	I told Tom I didn't know Mary very well.
6267541	eng	Tom says he's good at French.
6267542	eng	I've been very happy here.
6267543	eng	I heard from Tom that Mary will do that.
6267544	eng	Tom says he's been to Boston.
6267545	eng	I've been told to do that.
6267546	eng	I don't think Tom will do that for Mary.
6267547	eng	Tom says he'll do that today.
6267548	eng	I've been here since 2003.
6267549	eng	I don't like the way Tom smiles at Mary.
6267550	eng	Tom says he'll do that later.
6267551	eng	I've been arrested before.
6267552	eng	I don't know Tom as well as I know Mary.
6267553	eng	Tom says he'd rather go home.
6267554	eng	I've always loved history.
6267555	eng	I didn't pay Tom as much as I paid Mary.
6267556	eng	Tom says he wouldn't do that.
6267557	eng	I'm waiting for my change.
6267558	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's uncle.
6267559	eng	Tom says he ought to do that.
6267560	eng	I'm too young to buy beer.
6267561	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were married.
6267562	eng	Tom says he needs to do that.
6267563	eng	I'm too stupid to do that.
6267564	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were cousins.
6267565	eng	Tom said the concert was fun.
6267566	eng	I'm too sleepy to do that.
6267567	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were an item.
6267568	eng	Tom said that'll happen soon.
6267569	eng	I'm staying in Boston now.
6267570	eng	Didn't you know Tom was older than Mary?
6267571	eng	Tom said that he wasn't busy.
6267572	eng	I'm ready to leave Boston.
6267573	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's grandson?
6267574	eng	Tom said last year was tough.
6267575	eng	I'm ready to go to Boston.
6267576	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's daughter?
6267577	eng	Tom said it felt good to win.
6267578	eng	I'm rather busy right now.
6267579	eng	You should tell Tom Mary won't do that.
6267580	eng	Tom said it couldn't be done.
6267581	eng	I'm not the only survivor.
6267582	eng	You should tell Tom Mary will do that.
6267583	eng	Tom said he's ready to leave.
6267584	eng	I'm not sure how to react.
6267585	eng	You should tell Tom Mary can't do that.
6267586	eng	Tom said he's doing that now.
6267587	eng	I'm not really interested.
6267588	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary why he did that.
6267589	eng	Tom said he's been to Boston.
6267590	eng	I'm not ready to quit yet.
6267591	eng	Tom wouldn't be happy if Mary did that.
6267592	eng	Tom said he'll do that later.
6267593	eng	I'm not interested in art.
6267594	eng	Tom would've permitted Mary to do that.
6267595	eng	Tom said he'd win and he did.
6267596	eng	I'm not afraid to do that.
6267597	eng	Tom would never permit Mary to do that.
6267598	eng	Tom said he'd rather go home.
6267599	eng	I'm just about to do that.
6267600	eng	Tom would do that if Mary asked him to.
6267601	eng	Tom said he'd likely do that.
6267602	eng	I'm hoping you'll do that.
6267603	eng	Tom wondered where Mary wanted to live.
6267604	eng	Tom said he'd do that for us.
6267605	eng	I'm going to visit Boston.
6267606	eng	Tom won't permit Mary to do that again.
6267607	eng	Tom said he wasn't in Boston.
6267608	eng	I'm glad I went to Boston.
6267609	eng	Tom won't likely tell Mary he's sleepy.
6267610	eng	Tom said he wasn't convinced.

6268279	eng	Tom did that with enthusiasm.
6268280	eng	I didn't check my mailbox.

6268324	eng	Tom can't do that any longer.
6268325	eng	I can't get this jar open.
6268326	eng	Tom and I want to know more about Mary.
6268327	eng	Tom buys and sells old coins.
6268328	eng	I can't get my gloves off.

6268346	eng	I already know the secret.
6268347	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's brother?

6268365	eng	You should tell Tom Mary will do that.
6268366	eng	Tom and I weren't that close.
6268367	eng	How did you know his name?
6268368	eng	Tom's car cost a lot more than Mary's.
6268369	eng	Tom and I went out to dinner.
6268370	eng	Haven't you done that yet?
6268371	eng	Tom wouldn't tell Mary how to do that.
6268372	eng	Tom and I went out for lunch.
6268373	eng	Have you fixed everything?
6268374	eng	Tom wouldn't have helped Mary do that.

6268765	eng	Tom still wanted to do that.
6268766	eng	We seldom come to Boston.
6268767	eng	Tom said Mary isn't afraid to do that.
6268768	eng	Tom still hasn't apologized.
6268769	eng	We sat down at the table.
6268770	eng	Tom said Mary is reluctant to do that.
6268771	eng	Tom speaks French every day.
6268772	eng	We never do that anymore.
6268773	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still upset.
6268774	eng	Tom shouldn't do that again.
6268775	eng	We didn't stay in Boston.
6268776	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still tired.
6268777	eng	Tom should've stayed longer.
6268778	eng	We could do that for you.
6268779	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still bored.
6268780	eng	Tom should've spoken French.
6268781	eng	We can understand French.
6268782	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still awake.
6268783	eng	Tom should've gone with you.
6268784	eng	We ate pizza last Monday.
6268785	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still alone.
6268786	eng	Tom should've been truthful.
6268787	eng	Was yesterday a cold day?
6268788	eng	Tom said Mary is probably still alive.
6268789	eng	Tom should've been sleeping.
6268790	eng	Was it snowing yesterday?
6268791	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at piano.
6268792	eng	Tom should've been prepared.
6268793	eng	Was it raining yesterday?
6268794	eng	Tom said Mary is pretty good at chess.
6268795	eng	Tom should've been obedient.
6268796	eng	Those shoes belong to me.
6268797	eng	Tom said Mary is motivated to do that.
6268798	eng	Tom should've been forgiven.
6268799	eng	Those don't belong to me.
6268800	eng	Tom said Mary is going to go see John.
6268801	eng	Tom should've been arrested.
6268802	eng	This umbrella isn't mine.
6268803	eng	Tom said Mary is desperate to do that.
6268804	eng	Tom should do that sometime.
6268805	eng	This suitcase isn't mine.
6268806	eng	Tom said Mary has seen people do that.
6268807	eng	Tom should cancel his party.
6268808	eng	This paint dries quickly.
6268809	eng	Tom said Mary has only done that once.
6268810	eng	Tom shot himself last night.
6268811	eng	These pants are too long.
6268812	eng	Tom said Mary has never seen him swim.
6268813	eng	Tom shot and killed a tiger.
6268814	eng	These gloves aren't mine.
6268815	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't need to do that.
6268816	eng	Tom seldom does that for us.
6268817	eng	There's a tollgate ahead.
6268818	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to do that.
6268819	eng	Tom seldom does that for me.
6268820	eng	There was a lot of smoke.
6268821	eng	Tom said Mary didn't sound optimistic.
6268822	eng	Tom seems to be very hungry.
6268823	eng	The water is really cold.
6268824	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have a boyfriend.
6268825	eng	Tom seemed to be very upset.
6268826	eng	The system isn't perfect.
6268827	eng	Tom said Mary didn't get enough sleep.
6268828	eng	Tom seemed to be very tired.
6268829	eng	The case has been closed.
6268830	eng	Tom said Mary didn't care what we did.
6268831	eng	Tom seemed to be very happy.
6268832	eng	That's a sensitive issue.
6268833	eng	Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
6268834	eng	Tom seemed to be very angry.
6268835	eng	That car used to be mine.
6268836	eng	Tom said Mary couldn't do that either.
6268837	eng	Tom seemed to be having fun.
6268838	eng	Tell me how you did that.
6268839	eng	Tom put his hands on Mary's shoulders.
6268840	eng	Tom seemed tired and hungry.
6268841	eng	Some things won't change.
6268842	eng	Tom ought to tell Mary not to do that.
6268843	eng	Tom scared me half to death.
6268844	eng	Should we come to Boston?
6268845	eng	Tom needs to show Mary how to do that.
6268846	eng	Tom says that he'll do that.
6268847	eng	Please tell us the truth.
6268848	eng	Tom likes swimming and Mary does, too.
6268849	eng	Tom says he's taught French.
6268850	eng	Please give me all those.
6268851	eng	Tom let Mary know that he had arrived.
6268852	eng	Tom says he's learned a lot.
6268853	eng	Please give me all these.
6268854	eng	Tom knows that Mary shouldn't do that.
6268855	eng	Tom says he's good at chess.
6268856	eng	Please don't do that now.
6268857	eng	Tom knew Mary was supposed to do that.
6268858	eng	Tom says he'll do just that.
6268859	eng	Please do that right now.
6268860	eng	Tom killed himself after killing Mary.
6268861	eng	Tom says he'd never do that.
6268862	eng	Please do that once more.
6268863	eng	Tom isn't as old as Mary thinks he is.
6268864	eng	Tom says he used to do that.
6268865	eng	Please do that next week.
6268866	eng	Tom is still touring with Mary's band.
6268867	eng	Tom says he doesn't do that.
6268868	eng	Please do that carefully.
6268869	eng	Tom is determined to do that for Mary.
6268870	eng	Tom says I ought to do that.
6268871	eng	Our troubles aren't over.
6268872	eng	Tom is better at doing that than Mary.
6268873	eng	Tom said the picnic was fun.
6268874	eng	Our problems aren't over.
6268875	eng	Tom is afraid that Mary might do that.
6268876	eng	Tom said that he was sleepy.
6268877	eng	Open the package, please.
6268878	eng	Tom helped Mary deal with the problem.
6268879	eng	Tom said his team would win.
6268880	eng	Only two people did that.
6268881	eng	Tom has told Mary to leave John alone.
6268882	eng	Tom said he's ready to help.
6268883	eng	One of us should do that.
6268884	eng	Tom has told Mary he needs to do that.
6268885	eng	Tom said he's in Boston now.
6268886	eng	One of us has to do that.
6268887	eng	Tom has been told to leave Mary alone.
6268888	eng	Tom said he's been forgiven.
6268889	eng	My time is very valuable.
6268890	eng	Tom has asked Mary to change her mind.
6268891	eng	Tom said he'll visit Boston.
6268892	eng	My strength is returning.
6268893	eng	Tom hardly ever talks to Mary anymore.
6268894	eng	Tom said he'll do that soon.
6268895	eng	My room isn't very large.
6268896	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she wanted.
6268897	eng	Tom said he'd fly to Boston.
6268898	eng	My room isn't very clean.
6268899	eng	Tom gave Mary exactly what she needed.
6268900	eng	Tom said he'd do that later.
6268901	eng	My room isn't like yours.
6268902	eng	Tom found Mary's purse under the sofa.
6268903	eng	Tom said he wasn't Canadian.
6268904	eng	My office is a real mess.
6268905	eng	Tom forgot to remind Mary to buy eggs.
6268906	eng	Tom said he was feeling bad.
6268907	eng	My name is on the ballot.
6268908	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary was tired.
6268909	eng	Tom said he lost his temper.
6268910	eng	My house is easy to find.
6268911	eng	Tom doesn't think that Mary is hungry.
6268912	eng	Tom said he knows the rules.
6268913	eng	My friends laughed at me.
6268914	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will like John.
6268915	eng	Tom said he knew what to do.
6268916	eng	My father was a preacher.
6268917	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be scared.
6268918	eng	Tom said he kept doing that.
6268919	eng	My father is very strict.
6268920	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be lonely.
6268921	eng	Tom said he did that for us.
6268922	eng	My efforts were rewarded.
6268923	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be afraid.
6268924	eng	Tom said I ought to do that.
6268925	eng	My dreams have come true.
6268926	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be absent.
6268927	eng	Tom said I looked terrified.
6268928	eng	My children love animals.
6268929	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is retired yet.
6268930	eng	Tom said I looked perplexed.
6268931	eng	My birthday is next week.
6268932	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is embarrassed.
6268933	eng	Tom said I looked horrified.
6268934	eng	Monday will be a hot day.
6268935	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary is discouraged.
6268936	eng	Tom said I looked concerned.
6268937	eng	Mary has long brown hair.
6268938	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary has to do that.
6268939	eng	Tom said I had to study French.
6268940	eng	Make sure you're on time.
6268941	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary did that right.
6268942	eng	Tom said I had go to Boston.
6268943	eng	Look what I bought today.
6268944	eng	Tom doesn't like pizza, but Mary does.
6268945	eng	Tom refuses to speak French.
6268946	eng	Let's visit Boston first.
6268947	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary isn't happy.
6268948	eng	Tom received a lot of gifts.
6268949	eng	Let's visit Boston again.
6268950	eng	Tom doesn't know who did that to Mary.
6268951	eng	Tom really wants to do that.
6268952	eng	Let's speak French today.
6268953	eng	Tom doesn't know that Mary is unhappy.
6268954	eng	Tom really tried to do that.
6268955	eng	Let's not stay in Boston.
6268956	eng	Tom doesn't know how Mary got injured.
6268957	eng	Tom really needs to do that.
6268958	eng	Let's go to Boston first.
6268959	eng	Tom doesn't expect Mary to be on time.
6268960	eng	Tom put the key on the desk.
6268961	eng	Let's go to Boston again.
6268962	eng	Tom doesn't blame Mary for doing that.
6268963	eng	Tom promised that he'd help.
6268964	eng	Let's get out of the way.
6268965	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary will do that.
6268966	eng	Tom promised that he'd come.
6268967	eng	Let's do that right away.
6268968	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was pretty.
6268969	eng	Tom promised that he'd call.
6268970	eng	Let's do that next month.
6268971	eng	Tom didn't think that Mary was hungry.
6268972	eng	Tom promised he'll be there.
6268973	eng	Last month was very cold.
6268974	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be sleepy.
6268975	eng	Tom probably isn't busy now.
6268976	eng	It's way past my bedtime.
6268977	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be scared.
6268978	eng	Tom prefers to stay at home.
6268979	eng	It's very creepy in here.
6268980	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be lonely.
6268981	eng	Tom plays the clarinet well.
6268982	eng	It's too late to do that.
6268983	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would be afraid.
6268984	eng	Tom plans to stay in Boston.
6268985	eng	It's our duty to do that.
6268986	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was retired yet.
6268987	eng	Tom plans to live in Boston.
6268988	eng	It's now time to do that.
6268989	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was embarrassed.
6268990	eng	Tom plans to come to Boston.
6268991	eng	It's not good to do that.
6268992	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was discouraged.
6268993	eng	Tom packed a large suitcase.
6268994	eng	It's humid now in Boston.
6268995	eng	Tom didn't think Mary was cooperative.
6268996	eng	Tom ought to stay in Boston.
6268997	eng	It's foggy now in Boston.
6268998	eng	Tom didn't like the way Mary did that.
6268999	eng	Tom ought to have done that.
6269000	eng	It's cold here in Boston.
6269001	eng	Tom didn't like any of Mary's friends.
6269002	eng	Tom often gets into trouble.
6269003	eng	It's almost time for bed.
6269004	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so upset.
6269005	eng	Tom never does that with us.
6269006	eng	It's a risk worth taking.
6269007	eng	Tom didn't know why Mary was so tired.
6269008	eng	Tom never actually did that.
6269009	eng	Is there any coffee left?
6269010	eng	Tom didn't know what Mary was reading.
6269011	eng	Tom needs to stay in Boston.
6269012	eng	Is there any cheese left?
6269013	eng	Tom didn't know Mary wouldn't do that.
6269014	eng	Tom needs to be cooperative.
6269015	eng	Is it cold now in Boston?
6269016	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so tired.
6269017	eng	Tom must've wanted to speak.
6269018	eng	Is doing that prohibited?
6269019	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so happy.
6269020	eng	Tom must've been frustrated.
6269021	eng	I've visited Boston, too.
6269022	eng	Tom didn't even realize Mary had left.
6269023	eng	Tom must've been frightened.
6269024	eng	I've visited Boston once.
6269025	eng	Tom did that the way Mary told him to.
6269026	eng	Tom must've been astonished.
6269027	eng	I've studied French, too.
6269028	eng	Tom did that because Mary told him to.
6269029	eng	Tom must be in his thirties.
6269030	eng	I've seen people do that.
6269031	eng	Tom couldn't convince Mary to do that.
6269032	eng	Tom may speak French to you.
6269033	eng	I've never taught French.
6269034	eng	Tom could talk Mary out of doing that.
6269035	eng	Tom may have gone to Boston.
6269036	eng	I've left Boston already.
6269037	eng	Tom can swim at least as fast as Mary.
6269038	eng	Tom may do that if he wants.
6269039	eng	I've just visited Boston.
6269040	eng	Tom can do that much faster than Mary.
6269041	eng	Tom may do that if he likes.
6269042	eng	I've just read this book.
6269043	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to do that.
6269044	eng	Tom lost his job last month.
6269045	eng	I've just come to Boston.
6269046	eng	Tom asked Mary why she didn't do that.
6269047	eng	Tom lost his entire savings.
6269048	eng	I've got to take it easy.
6269049	eng	Tom asked Mary when the party started.
6269050	eng	Tom looked like he was busy.
6269051	eng	I've finished doing that.
6269052	eng	Tom asked Mary if she liked Thai food.
6269053	eng	Tom lives not far from here.
6269054	eng	I've done that, you know.
6269055	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting close to me.
6269056	eng	Tom likes the way you dance.
6269057	eng	I've always been on time.
6269058	eng	Tom and Mary were sitting at the back.
6269059	eng	Tom likes the way I do that.
6269060	eng	I've also studied French.
6269061	eng	Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
6269062	eng	Tom likely won't be on time.
6269063	eng	I'm willing to cooperate.
6269064	eng	Tom and Mary have something in common.
6269065	eng	Tom likely won't be nervous.
6269066	eng	I'm too tired to do that.
6269067	eng	Tom and Mary have just gotten married.
6269068	eng	Tom left for school at 6:30.
6269069	eng	I'm the person in charge.
6269070	eng	Tom and Mary have always been friends.
6269071	eng	Tom knows a lot about birds.
6269072	eng	I'm smarter than you are.
6269073	eng	Tom and Mary aren't going to be there.
6269074	eng	Tom keeps his uniform clean.
6269075	eng	I'm quite good at tennis.
6269076	eng	Tom and Mary are waiting in the lobby.
6269077	eng	Tom just did that last week.
6269078	eng	I'm not leaving you guys.
6269079	eng	Tom and I invited Mary to our wedding.
6269080	eng	Tom isn't very conservative.
6269081	eng	I'm not in my office now.
6269082	eng	Tom advised Mary to keep her promises.
6269083	eng	Tom isn't the only survivor.
6269084	eng	I'm not having much luck.
6269085	eng	Tom advised Mary to get more exercise.
6269086	eng	Tom isn't really good to me.
6269087	eng	I'm not doing that again.
6269088	eng	I think Tom will be able to help Mary.
6269089	eng	Tom isn't likely to be late.
6269090	eng	I'm glad I could do that.
6269091	eng	I didn't tell Tom anything about Mary.
6269092	eng	Tom isn't likely to be busy.
6269093	eng	My dog was hit by a car.
6269094	eng	I didn't tell Tom Mary was my ex-wife.
6269095	eng	Tom isn't afraid to do that.
6269096	eng	I'm afraid of doing that.
6269097	eng	I didn't realize Tom had to help Mary.
6269098	eng	Tom isn't a student anymore.
6269099	eng	I'll eat when I'm hungry.
6269100	eng	I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
6269101	eng	Tom is writing another book.
6269102	eng	I'll do that if possible.
6269103	eng	I didn't know that Tom was Mary's son.
6269104	eng	Tom is who I think did that.
6269105	eng	I'll die if I don't that.
6269106	eng	I didn't know Tom was older than Mary.
6269107	eng	Tom is well known in Boston.
6269108	eng	I'll continue to do that.
6269109	eng	I didn't know Tom helped Mary do that.
6269110	eng	Tom is very unlikely to win.
6269111	eng	I'll come to Boston soon.
6269112	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's father?
6269113	eng	Tom is trying to be popular.
6269114	eng	I'd rather do that alone.
6269115	eng	Didn't you know Tom was Mary's cousin?
6269116	eng	Tom is too tired to do that.
6269117	eng	I'd like to do that here.
6269118	eng	Didn't you know Tom doesn't like Mary?
6269119	eng	Tom is too timid to do that.
6269120	eng	I'd like a piece of cake.
6269121	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's sister?
6269122	eng	Tom is too small to do that.
6269123	eng	I'd better do that today.
6269124	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's mother?
6269125	eng	Tom is too short to do that.
6269126	eng	I'd be afraid to do that.
6269127	eng	Didn't you know Mary was Tom's cousin?
6269128	eng	Tom is too drunk to do that.
6269129	eng	I wouldn't do that again.
6269130	eng	Did you know Tom was Mary's boyfriend?
6269131	eng	Tom is still my best friend.
6269132	eng	I won't make you do that.
6269133	eng	You should tell Tom Mary can do that.
6269134	eng	Tom is starting to talk now.
6269135	eng	I won't do that tomorrow.
6269136	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wasn't at home.
6269137	eng	Tom is permitted to do that.
6269138	eng	I won't agree to do that.
6269139	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was doing that.
6269140	eng	Tom is over three years old.
6269141	eng	I wish you would do that.
6269142	eng	Tom wondered why Mary had to do that.
6269143	eng	Tom is older than all of us.
6269144	eng	I wasn't there yesterday.
6269145	eng	Tom wondered who Mary was married to.
6269146	eng	Tom is often busy on Monday.
6269147	eng	I wasn't having much fun.

6269563	eng	Tom can do that if he wants.
6269564	eng	I don't need to know why.

6269653	eng	Tom and I first met in 2013.
6269654	eng	I didn't talk about that.
6269655	eng	Tom may not come to Boston with Mary.

6269698	eng	Tom and I are in Boston now.
6269699	eng	I didn't go to the dance.
6269700	eng	Tom is doing that just to annoy Mary.

6269710	eng	Tom and I already know that.
6269711	eng	I didn't do that, either.
6269712	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was at home.
6269713	eng	Tom always seems to do that.
6269714	eng	I didn't do that so well.
6269715	eng	Tom has told Mary she has to do that.

6269717	eng	I didn't demand anything.
6269718	eng	Tom has found out Mary can't read.
6269719	eng	Tom always seems to be late.

6269722	eng	Tom always seems to be here.
6269723	eng	I didn't comment on that.
6269724	eng	Tom has already told Mary to do that.

6269748	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would do that.
6269749	eng	Tom won't make you do that.

6272305	eng	Tom can do that, and so can Mary.
6272306	eng	Tom didn't do that alone.
6272307	eng	Was it fun to do that?
6272308	eng	Tom asked me to do that for Mary.
6272309	eng	Tom did that his own way.
6272310	eng	Was it fun doing that?
6272311	eng	Tom asked if Mary had to do that.
6272312	eng	Tom did that all morning.
6272313	eng	This umbrella is mine.
6272314	eng	Tom asked Mary what her plan was.
6272315	eng	Tom deserves our respect.
6272316	eng	This tastes very good.
6272317	eng	Tom asked Mary to do that for us.
6272318	eng	Tom could've been afraid.
6272319	eng	This suitcase is mine.
6272320	eng	Tom asked Mary to close the door.
6272321	eng	Tom could still be alive.
6272322	eng	They know what I want.
6272323	eng	Tom asked Mary how she'd do that.
6272324	eng	Tom could face jail time.
6272325	eng	These gloves are mine.
6272326	eng	Tom and Mary met three years ago.
6272327	eng	Tom could be unconscious.
6272328	eng	The lawn needs mowing.
6272329	eng	Tom and Mary have become friends.
6272330	eng	Tom could be incompetent.
6272331	eng	That's not all we did.
6272332	eng	Tom and Mary don't often do that.
6272333	eng	Tom could be embarrassed.
6272334	eng	That was all my fault.
6272335	eng	Tom and Mary both studied French.
6272336	eng	Tom chose not to do that.
6272337	eng	Should I study French?
6272338	eng	Tom and Mary become good friends.
6272339	eng	Tom chased the cats away.
6272340	eng	Should I speak French?
6272341	eng	Tom and Mary become best friends.
6272342	eng	Tom can't do that either.
6272343	eng	Should I go to Boston?
6272344	eng	Tom and Mary are studying French.
6272345	eng	Tom can probably do that.
6272346	eng	Please pass the sugar.
6272347	eng	Tom and Mary are still in Boston.
6272348	eng	Tom can do that tomorrow.
6272349	eng	Please let me do that.

6272356	eng	Tom and I were at Mary's funeral.
6272357	eng	Tom believes that's true.
6272358	eng	Perhaps I can do that.
6272359	eng	Tom and I were able to help Mary.
6272360	eng	Tom begged me to do that.
6272361	eng	Our ordeal isn't over.
6272362	eng	Tom always speaks French to Mary.
6272363	eng	Tom and I were witnesses.
6272364	eng	My wounds have healed.
6272365	eng	Tom advised Mary to study French.
6272366	eng	Tom and I were surprised.

6272368	eng	Tom advised Mary to learn karate.
6272369	eng	Tom and I were roommates.
6272370	eng	My room is very messy.
6272371	eng	Tom advised Mary to learn French.
6272372	eng	Tom and I were impressed.
6272373	eng	My parents are strict.
6272374	eng	Maybe Tom spoke French with Mary.
6272375	eng	Tom and I were exhausted.
6272376	eng	My offer was declined.
6272377	eng	Mary and Alice are Tom's sisters.
6272378	eng	Tom and I want your help.
6272379	eng	My name's on the list.
6272380	eng	I think Tom and Mary had a fight.
6272381	eng	Tom and I talked quietly.
6272382	eng	My left leg is broken.
6272383	eng	I didn't tell Tom what Mary said.
6272384	eng	Tom and I switched seats.
6272385	eng	My first car was blue.
6272386	eng	I didn't see Tom, but I saw Mary.
6272387	eng	Tom and I split the bill.
6272388	eng	My feelings were hurt.
6272389	eng	I didn't see Tom talking to Mary.
6272390	eng	Tom and I need your help.
6272391	eng	My dog died yesterday.
6272392	eng	Don't let Tom give Mary anything.

6272402	eng	Tom and I met at a dance.
6272403	eng	My answer was correct.
6272404	eng	Will Tom permit Mary to do that?
6272405	eng	Tom and I hugged tightly.
6272406	eng	Monday was a cold day.
6272407	eng	Why would Tom have Mary do that?
6272408	eng	Tom and I have never met.
6272409	eng	Losing isn't much fun.
6272410	eng	Tom's actions saved Mary's life.
6272411	eng	Tom and I have broken up.
6272412	eng	Let's reconsider that.

6272415	eng	Let's not do that now.
6272416	eng	Tom will study French with Mary.
6272417	eng	Tom and I aren't married.
6272418	eng	Just try to stay calm.
6272419	eng	Tom went to ask Mary to do that.
6272420	eng	Tom and I aren't enemies.
6272421	eng	It's really very easy.
6272422	eng	Tom told me Mary was his sister.

6272424	eng	It's a very good idea.
6272425	eng	Tom told me Mary was his cousin.
6272426	eng	Tom and I are still here.
6272427	eng	Is it safe to do that?

6272429	eng	Tom and I are in trouble.
6272430	eng	Is it easy to do that?
6272431	eng	Tom told Mary which book to buy.
6272432	eng	Tom and I are having fun.
6272433	eng	Is it OK if I do that?
6272434	eng	Tom told Mary what he has to do.
6272435	eng	Tom and I are doing well.
6272436	eng	Is doing that illegal?
6272437	eng	Tom told Mary what he can't eat.
6272438	eng	Tom and I are doing fine.
6272439	eng	I've worked in Boston.

6272441	eng	Tom and I are carpenters.
6272442	eng	I've done that enough.
6272443	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd do that.
6272444	eng	Tom and I agree with you.
6272445	eng	I've been blacklisted.
6272446	eng	Tom told Mary that he was upset.
6272447	eng	Tom and I adopted a girl.
6272448	eng	I'm very hard working.
6272449	eng	Tom told Mary that he was ready.
6272450	eng	Tom admitted he did that.
6272451	eng	I'm too tired to work.
6272452	eng	Tom told Mary that he was broke.

6272455	eng	Tom told Mary that he was bored.
6272456	eng	Tom's dancing isn't bad.
6272457	eng	I'm scared to do that.
6272458	eng	Tom told Mary that he was alone.
6272459	eng	Tom would do that again.
6272460	eng	I'm not very handsome.

6272473	eng	Tom told Mary not to be so nosy.

6272477	eng	Tom won't be frightened.
6272478	eng	I'm a bit freaked out.
6272479	eng	Tom told Mary he'd study French.

6273121	eng	Tom said Mary wasn't in Boston.
6273122	eng	Tom adopted a stray dog.

6273140	eng	Tom won't ever do that.
6273141	eng	This tastes terrible.
6273142	eng	Tom said Mary seldom does that.
6273143	eng	Tom won't do that here.
6273144	eng	This land isn't ours.
6273145	eng	Tom said Mary ought to do that.

6273159	eng	The bottle was empty.
6273160	eng	Tom said Mary isn't interested.
6273161	eng	Tom will probably lose.
6273162	eng	That was a good idea.
6273163	eng	Tom said Mary is in Boston now.
6273164	eng	Tom will likely be shy.
6273165	eng	That strategy worked.
6273166	eng	Tom said Mary always does that.
6273167	eng	Tom will be suspicious.

6273196	eng	Tom has asked Mary to help him.
6273197	eng	Tom was self-conscious.
6273198	eng	One of you has to go.

6277771	eng	Tom thought Mary's plan wasn't very good.
6277772	eng	I think I know what Tom would say.
6277773	eng	Why should Tom do that if he doesn't have to?
6277774	eng	Why did Tom think doing that was a good idea?
6277775	eng	What makes you think Tom has never done that?
6277776	eng	I didn't believe what Tom told me.

6277778	eng	Tom will try to persuade Mary not to do that.

6277793	eng	I wanted to tell Tom that I couldn't do that.
6277794	eng	Tom isn't very good at playing the piano.
6277795	eng	I thought Tom was going to help Mary do that.
6277796	eng	Tom probably forgot to tell Mary to do that.
6277797	eng	Tom is never going to find out who did that.
6277798	eng	Tom is going to ask Mary if she can do that.
6277799	eng	Tom is a lot better at doing that than I am.
6277800	eng	Tom has found an interesting way to do that.
6277801	eng	Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry to do that.
6277802	eng	Tom didn't know he had to help Mary do that.
6277803	eng	Tom and Mary were the first ones to do that.
6277804	eng	Tom has never told me anything about you.
6277805	eng	Tom and Mary are always doing that together.

6277807	eng	If you tell Tom how to do that, he'll do it.
6277808	eng	I'm sure Tom will think of a way to do that.
6277809	eng	I'm not sure whether Tom can do that or not.
6277810	eng	I wonder why Tom suggested we do that today.
6277811	eng	I wonder how many people saw Tom doing that.
6277812	eng	I was hoping Tom wouldn't ask me to do that.
6277813	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to go hang gliding.
6277814	eng	I thought that Tom wasn't likely to do that.

6277838	ukr	Я б хотів знати, як Том це зробив.
6277839	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, як Том це зробив.

6277842	ukr	Це може бути причиною того, що Том вчинив самогубство.

6277860	ukr	Том зрозумів, що Мері не слід цього робити.
6277861	ukr	Я не знав, що Том може це зробити.
6277862	ukr	Я думаю, що Том теж це зробить.

6277879	ukr	Єдина людина, кого Том знає в Бостоні, — це Мері.
6277880	ukr	Кінь, що переміг на перегонах, належить Тому.
6277881	ukr	Скажи Тому, що я не планую залишатися надовго.
6277882	ukr	Скажи Тому, що я не планую бути довго.

6277901	ukr	Я не думаю, що у Тома колись була дівчина.
6277902	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том колись раніше був тут.

6277910	ukr	Як ти думаєш, коли Том буде тут?
6277911	ukr	Як ви думаєте, коли Том буде тут?
6277912	ukr	Коли Том сказав мені це, я не повірив.
6277913	ukr	Те, що Том нещодавно сказав нам, є неправдою.
6277914	ukr	Чи Тому насправді було необхідно бути тут?
6277915	ukr	Спробуй подивитися на це з точки зору Тома.
6277916	ukr	Спробуйте подивитися на це з точки зору Тома.
6277917	ukr	Батьки Тома та його дружина на ладять.

6277948	ukr	Якщо Том попросить мене допомогти йому, я допоможу.
6277949	ukr	Том не зробив нічого з того, що йому сказали.

6278012	ukr	Дуже шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб нам допомогти.
6278013	ukr	Саме Том розповів про це Мері.
6278014	ukr	Я думаю, Тому би це дуже сподобалося.
6278015	ukr	Том хотів знати, хто батько Мері.
6278016	ukr	Думаю, Том міг би це зробити краще.
6278017	ukr	Том думав, що план Мері не дуже добрий.
6278018	ukr	Я думаю, що знаю, що сказав би Том.
6278019	ukr	Гадаю, що знаю, що сказав би Том.
6278020	ukr	Чому Тому слід це робити, якщо він цього робити не зобов'язаний?
6278021	ukr	Чому Том думає, що зробти це було доброю ідеєю?
6278022	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том ніколи цього не робив?
6278023	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том ніколи цього не робив?
6278024	ukr	Я не вірю тому, що сказав мені Том.
6278025	ukr	Те, що ми з Томом зробили того дня, неможливо пробачити.
6278026	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері не робити цього.
6278027	ukr	Том ніколи не зможе зробити цього один.
6278028	ukr	Том сказав про Мері жахливі речі.
6278029	ukr	Том допоможе тобі це зробити, якщо хочеш.
6278030	ukr	Том допоможе вам це зробити, якщо хочеш.
6278031	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше, коли він буде не такий зайнятий.
6278032	ukr	Це зробив не Том. Це була Мері.
6278033	ukr	Том сказав мені, де він планував це робити.
6278034	ukr	Тому слід сказати Мері, що вона повинна це зробити.
6278035	ukr	Том сказав, що пам'ятає, що попросив Мері це зробити.
6278036	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібний спеціальний інструмент, щоб це зробити.
6278037	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері хоче це зробити.
6278038	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері потрібно це зробити.
6278039	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що я цього не робитиму.
6278040	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері небагато грошей.
6278041	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278042	ukr	Я хотіла сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278043	ukr	Том не дуже добре грає на піаніно.
6278044	ukr	Я думав, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278045	ukr	Я гадала, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278046	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати Мері зробити це.
6278047	ukr	Том ніколи не дізнається, хто це зробив.
6278048	ukr	Том запитає Мері, чи вона може це зробити.
6278049	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж Мері.
6278050	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж я.
6278051	ukr	Том придумав цікавий спосіб, як це зробити.
6278052	ukr	Том, здається, не поспішав цього робити.
6278053	ukr	Том не знав, що він має допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278054	ukr	Том та Мері були перші, хто це зробив.
6278055	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про тебе не розповідав.
6278056	ukr	Том та Мері завжди роблять це разом.
6278057	ukr	Том вже знає, чому Мері хоче це зробити.
6278058	ukr	Якщо ти розповіш Тому, як це зробити, він це зробить.
6278059	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає, як це зробити.
6278060	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає спосіб, як це зробити.
6278061	ukr	Я не певен, чи може це Том зробити, чи ні.
6278062	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том запропонував нам це зробити сьогодні.
6278063	ukr	Цікаво, скільки людей бачило, як Том це робив.
6278064	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не проситиме мене робити це.
6278065	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не проситиме мене зробити це.
6278066	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері полетіла на дельтаплані.
6278067	ukr	Я думав, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278068	ukr	Я гадала, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278069	ukr	Я думаю, що саме Том сказав Мері це зробити.
6278070	ukr	Я думаю, Том, можливо, зможе це зробити для Мері.
6278071	eng	I think Tom is planning to do that tomorrow.
6278072	eng	Tom knew he was no longer needed.
6278073	eng	I think Tom doesn't really enjoy doing that.
6278074	eng	I had no idea that Tom was going to do that.
6278075	eng	I don't think Tom will ever stop doing that.
6278076	eng	I don't think Tom has ever done that before.
6278077	eng	I don't think Tom could get Mary to do that.
6278078	eng	I don't know if Tom wants to do that or not.
6278079	eng	I didn't know that Tom was going to do that.
6278080	eng	Haven't you asked Tom why he didn't do that?
6278081	eng	Would you tell Tom why Mary didn't do that?
6278082	eng	Why would Tom need Mary to do that for him?
6278083	eng	Why should Tom ask Mary to do that for him?
6278084	eng	Why in the world would Tom want to do that?
6278085	eng	Why does Tom want to waste time doing that?
6278086	eng	Tom has just escaped from prison.
6278087	eng	Where do you think Tom is going to do that?
6278088	eng	I think Tom isn't going to be here today.
6278089	eng	Was it really necessary for Tom to do that?
6278090	eng	Tom will try to find out why Mary did that.
6278091	eng	Tom will probably get hurt if he does that.
6278092	eng	Tom will probably find some way to do that.
6278093	eng	Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
6278094	eng	Who does Tom think is going to be there?
6278095	eng	When Tom told that joke, nobody laughed.
6278096	eng	What makes you think Tom won't be there?
6278097	eng	Tom's sunglasses are still on the table.
6278098	eng	Tom was at the party until the very end.
6278099	eng	Tom thought Mary's plan was pretty good.
6278100	eng	Tom should've told me about that sooner.
6278101	eng	Tom didn't have enough strength to do that.
6278102	eng	Tom should've been a little more polite.
6278103	eng	Tom must've forgotten to tell Mary that.
6278104	eng	Tom just told me what needed to be done.
6278105	eng	I think Tom isn't going to do that, either.
6278106	eng	Tom isn't likely to be busy after lunch.
6278107	eng	Tom is preparing for an important event.
6278108	eng	Tom is holding a knife in his left hand.
6278109	eng	Tom has decided not to become a teacher.
6278110	eng	What was Tom doing at that time?
6278111	eng	Tom carries a gun with him all the time.
6278112	eng	Tom will very unlikely ever do that again.
6278113	eng	Tom told me that I didn't have to do that.
6278114	eng	Tom said he'd prefer not to do that today.
6278115	eng	Tom already knows what Mary plans to do.
6278116	eng	There are a lot of things Tom won't eat.
6278117	eng	Tom really should be doing that right now.
6278118	eng	Tom isn't suggesting Mary did that, is he?
6278119	eng	I'm sure Tom won't want anything to eat.
6278120	eng	Tom isn't likely to forget how to do that.
6278121	eng	I thought Tom was going to like it here.
6278122	eng	I think we're all upset by what Tom did.
6278123	eng	Tom has decided to never to do that again.
6278124	eng	I hope Tom doesn't have to go to prison.
6278125	eng	I hope Tom did what you asked him to do.
6278126	eng	Tom has been in bed all morning.
6278127	eng	Tom didn't realize Mary shouldn't do that.
6278128	eng	Tom didn't buy everything he wanted.
6278129	eng	Have you ever heard Tom play the guitar?
6278130	eng	Everybody assumed that Tom was Canadian.
6278131	eng	Please ask Tom to show you how to do that.
6278132	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't allow me to do that.
6278133	eng	I wonder why Tom doesn't enjoy doing that.
6278134	eng	Tom will do whatever you ask him to do.
6278135	eng	I wonder when Tom was planning to do that.
6278136	eng	Tom wished he had more friends.
6278137	eng	I think Tom doesn't want to do that today.
6278138	eng	Tom thought something bad might happen.
6278139	eng	I don't think Tom will ever do that again.
6278140	eng	Do you think Tom would care if I did that?
6278141	eng	Tom was crying the entire time.
6278142	eng	Tom sleeps with a gun under his pillow.
6278143	eng	Tom should've helped Mary more.
6278144	eng	Too bad Tom wasn't here to do that today.
6278145	eng	Tom will try to persuade Mary to do that.
6278146	eng	Tom knew Mary wasn't likely to be late.
6278147	eng	Tom knew Mary didn't have enough money.
6278148	eng	Tom is trying to make some new friends.
6278149	eng	Tom will get fired if he doesn't do that.
6278150	eng	Tom is reading a mystery novel.
6278151	eng	Tom will do that if you pay him to do it.
6278152	eng	Tom will do that if you ask him politely.
6278153	eng	Tom will definitely try doing that today.
6278154	eng	Tom gave the robbers everything he had.
6278155	eng	Tom said he'd never tell Mary to do that.
6278156	eng	Tom said he'd never allow you to do that.
6278157	eng	Tom said he'd be glad to do that for you.
6278158	eng	Tom realized he had to help Mary do that.
6278159	eng	Tom didn't know who Mary's husband was.
6278160	eng	I was waiting for Tom to leave.
6278161	eng	Tom made me swear never to do that again.
6278162	eng	Tom and Mary went to the mall together.
6278163	eng	Tom and Mary used to ignore each other.
6278164	eng	Tom is unlikely to forget how to do that.
6278165	eng	This is the last letter Tom ever wrote.
6278166	eng	Tom is the only one here who can do that.
6278167	eng	Tom is still not very good at doing that.
6278168	eng	That's exactly what Tom ended up doing.
6278169	eng	Tom couldn't have done that without help.
6278170	eng	I was hoping Tom wouldn't buy that car.
6278171	eng	I'm the one who convinced Tom to do that.
6278172	eng	I'm sure Tom won't want to do that today.
6278173	eng	Tom heard some strange noises.
6278174	eng	I'll ask Tom to show Mary how to do that.
6278175	eng	I'll ask Tom to make sure Mary does that.
6278176	eng	I wonder why Tom was planning to do that.
6278177	eng	I wonder when Tom wanted Mary to do that.
6278178	eng	Tom gave Mary some more money.
6278179	eng	I was hoping Tom would ask me to do that.
6278180	eng	I hope Tom did what we asked him to do.
6278181	eng	I told Tom you wouldn't enjoy doing that.
6278182	eng	I thought that Tom was likely to do that.
6278183	eng	I'm still responsible for Tom.
6278184	eng	I think that's why Tom wanted to do that.
6278185	eng	I think Tom may be able to do that today.
6278186	eng	Who did Tom plan to go to Boston with?
6278187	eng	I think Tom has forgotten how to do that.
6278188	eng	Tom was talking on the phone.
6278189	eng	I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
6278190	eng	Tom was scared to go outside.
6278191	eng	Do you think Tom will ever do that again?
6278192	eng	Tom will do whatever needs to be done.
6278193	eng	Will anyone care if Tom doesn't do that?
6278194	eng	Tom tried to finish what he was doing.
6278195	eng	Why don't Tom and I do that right now?
6278196	eng	When did Tom show you to how to do that?
6278197	eng	Whatever you do, don't do that with Tom.
6278198	eng	Tom said some terrible things to Mary.
6278199	eng	Tom said he was starting to get tired.
6278200	eng	Tom is dressed appropriately.
6278201	eng	Tom never thought Mary would kiss him.
6278202	eng	Tom never thought Mary would hurt him.
6278203	eng	Tom had problems in school.
6278204	eng	Tom will have to do that someplace else.
6278205	eng	Tom knew that Mary wasn't from Boston.
6278206	eng	Tom knew Mary wasn't likely to say no.
6278207	eng	Tom will definitely never do that again.
6278208	eng	Tom wanted to stop Mary from doing that.
6278209	eng	Tom told Mary that she ought to do that.
6278210	eng	Tom is the youngest of three brothers.
6278211	eng	Tom told Mary that she couldn't do that.
6278212	eng	Tom strongly advised against doing that.
6278213	eng	Tom said he wasn't ready to do that yet.
6278214	eng	Tom said he needed to help Mary do that.
6278215	eng	Tom knows there's no way he can do that.
6278216	eng	Tom had no idea of what was happening.
6278217	eng	Tom got a babysitter for his children.
6278218	eng	Tom didn't have any friends in Boston.
6278219	eng	Tom is trying not to sneeze.
6278220	eng	Tom didn't believe anything Mary said.
6278221	eng	Tom is going to see if Mary can do that.
6278222	eng	Tom couldn't get the closet door open.
6278223	eng	It's not a good idea to let Tom do that.
6278224	eng	Tom always has his harmonica with him.
6278225	eng	I should be helping Tom now.
6278226	eng	I'd like to know why Tom didn't do that.
6278227	eng	That's not what Tom is planning to do.
6278228	eng	I told Tom you wouldn't want to do that.
6278229	eng	I thought I was going to see Tom here.
6278230	eng	I thought you knew Tom couldn't do that.
6278231	eng	Tom still has things to do.
6278232	eng	I think Tom has done that once or twice.
6278233	eng	I don't think Tom would mind doing that.
6278234	eng	Don't you want to know how Tom did it?
6278235	eng	Have you ever asked Tom why he did that?
6278236	eng	Aren't you and Tom about the same age?
6278237	eng	Do you think Tom might enjoy doing that?
6278238	eng	Did Tom really do that without any help?
6278239	eng	What makes you think Tom won't do that?
6278240	eng	Tom's house was very nice.
6278241	eng	Tom was scared and I was scared, too.
6278242	eng	Tom told Mary what needed to be done.
6278243	eng	Tom told Mary about what he had done.
6278244	eng	Tom will be able to do that on his own.
6278245	eng	Tom was the one who told me to do that.
6278246	eng	Tom really should've eaten breakfast.
6278247	eng	Tom realized there was only one exit.
6278248	eng	Tom realized he was no longer needed.
6278249	eng	Tom proposed to Mary just last night.
6278250	eng	Tom should've told Mary not to do that.
6278251	eng	Tom played video games all afternoon.
6278252	eng	Tom says he wants to help Mary do that.
6278253	eng	Tom never told me anything about you.
6278254	eng	Tom says he isn't ready to do that yet.
6278255	eng	Tom knew more than he was letting on.
6278256	eng	Tom said he'd rather do that next week.
6278257	eng	Tom said he'd prefer that Mary do that.
6278258	eng	Tom said he'd never ever do that again.
6278259	eng	Tom knew Mary was going to be hungry.
6278260	eng	Tom said he was in no hurry to do that.
6278261	eng	Tom just called me a few minutes ago.
6278262	eng	Tom isn't going to come live with us.
6278263	eng	Tom said he couldn't resist doing that.
6278264	eng	Tom is the one who grew this lettuce.
6278265	eng	Tom bought what he wanted.
6278266	eng	Tom is likely to be busy after lunch.
6278267	eng	Tom always tries his best.
6278268	eng	Tom is in his room, changing clothes.
6278269	eng	Who did Tom want to hire?
6278270	eng	Tom is going to like being in Boston.
6278271	ukr	Я думаю, що Том планує зробити це завтра.
6278272	ukr	Том знав, що він вже не потрібний.
6278273	ukr	Я думаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278274	ukr	Гадаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278275	ukr	Я не мав уяви, що Том буде це робити.
6278276	ukr	Я не мала поняття, що Том буде це робити.
6278277	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том колись припинить це робити.
6278278	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь перестане це робити.
6278279	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це колись робив.
6278280	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь це робив.
6278281	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том міг би переконати Мері це зробити.
6278282	ukr	Не думаю, що Том зміг переконати Мері це зробити.
6278283	ukr	Я не знаю, чи Том хое це робити, чи ні.
6278284	ukr	Я не знав, що Том це робитиме.
6278285	ukr	Я не знала, що Том це робитиме.
6278286	ukr	Хіба ти не питав Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278287	ukr	Хіба ти не запитала Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278288	ukr	Ти б сказав Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278289	ukr	Ти не міг би сказати Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278290	ukr	Навіщо Тому знадобилася би Мері, щоб це для нього зробити?
6278291	ukr	Чому Тому треба просити Мері це для нього зробити?
6278292	ukr	З якого дива Том хотів би це зробити?
6278293	ukr	Чому Том хоче марнувати на це час?
6278294	ukr	Том щойно втік із в'язниці.
6278295	ukr	Чому, на твою думку, Тому робитиме це?
6278296	ukr	Гадаю, Тома сьогодні тут не буде.
6278297	ukr	Тому було насправді необхідно це робити?
6278298	ukr	Том спробує дізнатися, чому Мері це зробила.
6278299	ukr	Том, можливо, зазнає травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278300	ukr	Том, імовірно, придумає, як це зробити.
6278301	ukr	Том ніколи за це не пробачить Мері.
6278302	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, там буде?
6278303	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей анекдот, ніхто не засміявся.
6278304	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей жарт, ніхто не засміявся.
6278305	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Тома там не буде?
6278306	ukr	Чому ви вважаєте, що Тома там не буде?
6278307	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще на столі.
6278308	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще лежать на столі.
6278309	ukr	Том був на вечірці до самого кінця.
6278310	ukr	Том думав, що у Мері доволі непоганий план.
6278311	ukr	Тому слід було сказати мені про це раніше.
6278312	ukr	У Тома не було достатньо сил, щоб зробити це.
6278313	ukr	Том слід було бути ввічливішим.
6278314	ukr	Том слід було бути більш чемним.
6278315	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати про це Мері.
6278316	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув розповісти про це Мері.
6278317	ukr	Том щойно розповів мені, що треба було зробити.
6278318	ukr	Том просто розповів мені, що треба зробити.
6278319	ukr	Я думаю, Том цього теж не робитиме.
6278320	ukr	Навряд чи Том буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278321	ukr	Том готується до важливої події.
6278322	ukr	У лівій руці Том тримає ніж.
6278323	ukr	Том вирішив не ставати вчителем.
6278324	ukr	Що у той час робив Том?
6278325	ukr	Том весь час носить з собою зброю.
6278326	ukr	Дуже малоймовірно, що Том це зробить коли-небудь ще раз.
6278327	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язаний цього робити.
6278328	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язана цього робити.
6278329	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це сьогодні.
6278330	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278331	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує зробити Мері.
6278332	ukr	Є багато всього, чого Том не їстиме.
6278333	ukr	Тому насправді слід це робити просто зараз.
6278334	ukr	Том не натякає на те, що це зробила Мері, чи не так?
6278335	ukr	Я певен, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278336	ukr	Я певна, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278337	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278338	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робити.
6278339	ukr	Я думав, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278340	ukr	Я думала, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278341	ukr	Думаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278342	ukr	Гадаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278343	ukr	Том вирішив ніколи більше цього не робити.
6278344	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тома не муситиме сидіти у в'язниці.
6278345	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросив.
6278346	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросила.
6278347	ukr	Том весь ранок провів у ліжку.
6278348	ukr	Том не розумів, що Мері не повинна цього робити.
6278349	ukr	Том не купив усе, що хотів.
6278350	ukr	Ти чув, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278351	ukr	Ти чула, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278352	ukr	Усі подумали, що Том канадієць.
6278353	ukr	Будь ласка, покажи Тому, як це робиться.
6278354	ukr	Будь ласка, покажіть Тому, як це зробити.
6278355	ukr	Я певен, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278356	ukr	Я певна, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278357	ukr	Мені цікаво, чому Том не отримує від цього задоволення.
6278358	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ти його попросиш.
6278359	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ви його попросите.
6278360	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том планував це зробити.
6278361	ukr	Тому хотів би, щоб у нього було більше друзів.
6278362	ukr	Думаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278363	ukr	Гадаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278364	ukr	Том думав, що, можливо, сталося щось погане.
6278365	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це робитиме ще.
6278366	ukr	Думаєш, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278367	ukr	Гадаєте, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278368	ukr	Том увесь час плакав.
6278369	ukr	Том спить зі зброєю під подушкою.
6278370	ukr	Тому слід було б більше допомагати Мері.
6278371	ukr	Шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб це зробити.
6278372	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері зробити це.
6278373	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи спізниться.
6278374	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері недостатньо грошей.
6278375	ukr	Том намагається познайомитися з новими друзями.
6278376	ukr	Тома звільнять, якщо він цього не зробить.
6278377	ukr	Том читає детектив.
6278378	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти йому за це заплатиш.
6278379	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви йому за це заплатите.
6278380	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти його ввічливо попросиш.
6278381	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви його ввічливо попросите.
6278382	ukr	Звичайно ж Том спробує це зробити сьогодні.
6278383	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникам усе, що у нього було.
6278384	ukr	Том сказав, що ніколи не сказав би Мері цього робити.
6278385	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволив цього робити.
6278386	ukr	Том сказав, що з радістю це для тебе зробить.
6278387	ukr	Том зрозумів, що має допомогти Мері це зробити.
6278388	ukr	Том не знав, хто чоловік Мері.
6278389	ukr	Я чекаю, щоб Том пішов.
6278390	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я більше цього не робитиму.
6278391	ukr	Том та Мері разом пішли до тогрівельного центру.
6278392	ukr	Том та Мері колись ігнорували одне одного.
6278393	ukr	Малоймовірно, що Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278394	ukr	Це самий останній лист, написаний Томом.
6278395	ukr	Том єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6278396	ukr	Том все ще не дуже добре вміє це робити.
6278397	ukr	Саме це врешті-решт зробив Том.
6278398	ukr	Том не зміг би цього зробити без допомоги.
6278399	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не купуватиме цієї машини.
6278400	ukr	Це я переконав Тома зробити це.
6278401	ukr	Це я переконала Тома зробити це.
6278402	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278403	ukr	Я певна, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278404	ukr	Том чув якісь дивні звуки.
6278405	ukr	Том почув якісь дивні звуки.
6278406	ukr	Я попрошу Тома показати Мері, як це зробити.
6278407	ukr	Я попрошу Тома переконатися в тому, що Мері це робитиме.
6278408	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том планував це зробити.
6278409	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том хотів, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278410	ukr	Том дав Мері ще трохи грошей.
6278411	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278412	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278413	ukr	Я сподіваюся, що Том зробив те, про що ми його попросили.
6278414	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що тобі не сподобається це робити.
6278415	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що вам не сподобається це робити.
6278416	ukr	Я думав, що Том, ймовірно, це зробить.
6278417	ukr	Я все ще відповідаю за Тома.
6278418	ukr	Я думаю, ось чому том хотів це зробити.
6278419	ukr	Думаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278420	ukr	Гадаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278421	ukr	З ким Том планував поїхати до Бостона?
6278422	ukr	Думаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278423	ukr	Гадаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278424	ukr	Том говорив по телефону.
6278425	ukr	Том балакав по телефону.
6278426	ukr	Я не думаю, що Тому сподобалося би це робити.
6278427	ukr	Тому було лячно йти на вулицю.
6278428	ukr	Тому було лячно йти на двір.
6278429	ukr	Думаєш, Том це коли-небудь буде робити?
6278430	ukr	Том зробить все, що необхідно зробити.
6278431	ukr	Ніхто не заперечує, якщо Том це зробить?
6278432	ukr	Том спробував закінчити те, що він робив.
6278433	ukr	Том намагався закінчити те, що він робив.
6278434	ukr	Чому ми з Томом не робимо цього зараз?
6278435	ukr	Коли Том показав тобі, як це робиться?
6278436	ukr	Коли Том показав вам, як це робиться?
6278437	ukr	Що б ти не робив, не роби цього з Томом.
6278438	ukr	Що б ти не робила, не роби цього з Томом.
6278439	ukr	Том сказав Мері жахливі речі.
6278440	ukr	Том сказав, що він починає втомлюватися.
6278441	ukr	Том вдягнений відповідно до ситуації.
6278442	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері його поцілує.
6278443	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може завдати йому біль.
6278444	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може зробити йому боляче.
6278445	ukr	У Тома були проблеми в школі.
6278446	ukr	Тому буде потрібно зробити це в якомусь іншому місці.
6278447	ukr	Том знав, що Мере не з Бостона.
6278448	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи відмовиться.
6278449	ukr	Том однозначно цього більше не робитиме.
6278450	ukr	Том хотів зупинити Мері від того, щоб вона це зробила.
6278451	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що вона має це зробити.
6278452	ukr	Том наймолодший з трьох братів.
6278453	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що мона може це зробити.
6278454	ukr	Том наполегливо радив не робити цього.
6278455	ukr	Том сказав, що він все ще не готовий це робити.
6278456	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потбрібно допомоги Мері зробити це.
6278457	ukr	Том знає, що він цього аж ніяк не може зробити.
6278458	ukr	Том уяви не мав, що відбувалося.
6278459	ukr	Том знайшов няню для своїх дітей.
6278460	ukr	У Тома не було у Бостоні жодних друзів.
6278461	ukr	Том намагається не чхнути.
6278462	ukr	Том не вірив нічому, що говорила Мері.
6278463	ukr	Том не повірив ні у що, що розповіла Мері.
6278464	ukr	Том побачить, чи Мері зможе це зробити.
6278465	ukr	Том не зміг відчинити двері шафи.
6278466	ukr	Це не дуже добра ідея дозволити Тому зробити це.
6278467	ukr	У Тома завжди з собою його губна гармоніка.
6278468	ukr	Я повинен зараз допомагати Тому.
6278469	ukr	Я повинна зараз допомагати Тому.
6278470	ukr	Я б хотів знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278471	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278472	ukr	Том не це планує зробити.
6278473	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що ти не захочеш цього робити.
6278474	ukr	Я сказала Тому, що ви не захочете цього робити.
6278475	ukr	Я думав, що побачу тут Тома.
6278476	ukr	Я думала, що побачу тут Тома.
6278477	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278478	ukr	Я думала, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278479	ukr	У Тома все ще є що робити.
6278480	ukr	Я думаю, Том робив це одного разу чи двічі.
6278481	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том матимеме щось проти того, щоб це зробити.
6278482	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш знати, як Том це зробив?
6278483	ukr	Хіба ви не хочете знати, як Том це зробив?
6278484	ukr	Ти коли-небудь запитував Тома, як він це зробив?
6278485	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом приблизно не одного віку?
6278486	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом не ровесники?
6278487	ukr	Думаєш, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278488	ukr	Думаєте, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278489	ukr	Том і насправді зробив це без будь-якої допомоги?
6278490	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278491	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278492	ukr	Будинок Тома був дуже гарний.
6278493	ukr	Том був переляканий, і я також.
6278494	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що треба зробити.
6278495	ukr	Том розповів Мері про те, що він зробив.
6278496	ukr	Том зможе це зробити один.
6278497	ukr	Це Том сказав мені це зробити.
6278498	ukr	Тому насправді варто було поснідати.
6278499	ukr	Том зрозумів, що був лише один вихід.
6278500	ukr	Том зрозумів, що він більше не потрібен.
6278501	ukr	Том лише учора ввечері зробив Мері пропозицію.
6278502	ukr	Том повинен був сказати Мері не робити цього.
6278503	ukr	Том грав у комп'ютерні ігри весь день.
6278504	ukr	Том каже, що хоче допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278505	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про вас не розповідав.
6278506	ukr	Том каже, що ще не готовий цього робити.
6278507	ukr	Том знав більше, ніж казав.
6278508	ukr	Том сказав, що йому краще це зробити наступного тижня.
6278509	ukr	Том сказав, що він би хотів, щоб це зробила Мері.
6278510	ukr	Том сказав, що більше ніколи цього не робитиме.
6278511	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде голодна.
6278512	ukr	Том сказав, що немає поспіху у тому, що він робить.
6278513	ukr	Том щойно зателефонував мені кілька хвилин тому.
6278514	ukr	Том не прийде жити з нами.
6278515	ukr	Том сказав, що не може втриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6278516	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат.
6278517	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат-латук.
6278518	ukr	Том купив те, що хотів.
6278519	ukr	Том, імовірно, буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278520	ukr	Том завжди робить все, що може.
6278521	ukr	Том у своїй кімнаті, переодягається.
6278522	ukr	Кого хотів найняти Том?
6278523	ukr	Тому сподобається в Бостоні.
6278524	eng	Tom has been watching TV all evening.
6278525	eng	Tom doesn't know what he needs to do.
6278526	eng	Tom is probably busy now.
6278527	eng	Tom is definitely afraid.
6278528	eng	Tom did everything he was told to do.
6278529	eng	I had no idea Tom was going to do that.
6278530	eng	Tom assured me the gun wasn't loaded.
6278531	eng	Tom has proposed to Mary.
6278532	eng	How did you find out that Tom did that?
6278533	eng	Tom got out of the water.
6278534	eng	Would you like Tom to do that for you?
6278535	eng	Tom agreed to meet Mary after school.
6278536	eng	You'll have to help Tom.
6278537	eng	I thought Tom was going to like Mary.
6278538	eng	I think you should go there with Tom.
6278539	eng	I think Tom went to Boston last week.
6278540	eng	I think Tom wasn't telling the truth.
6278541	eng	I think Tom didn't tell us the truth.
6278542	eng	Tom won't be allowed to do that again.
6278543	eng	Tom will do that later this afternoon.
6278544	eng	Tom will do that if Mary wants him to.
6278545	eng	Tom regained his health.
6278546	eng	Tom tried to do that, but he couldn't.
6278547	eng	Tom gave Mary a quick kiss and got on the bus.
6278548	eng	Tom doesn't remember anything from that night.
6278549	eng	Tom said he'd rather not do that here.
6278550	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary makes spaghetti.
6278551	eng	Tom's van is parked in the driveway.
6278552	eng	Tom said he'd rather die than do that.
6278553	eng	Tom heard Mary shouting.
6278554	eng	Tom doesn't have enough money to buy a ticket.
6278555	eng	Tom said he wasn't willing to do that.
6278556	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to go to Boston with him.
6278557	eng	Tom didn't realize Mary was John's girlfriend.
6278558	eng	Tom might get injured if he does that.
6278559	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary was a married woman.
6278560	eng	Tom didn't know Mary had spent time in prison.
6278561	eng	Tom didn't know Mary had never been to Boston.
6278562	eng	Tom carries a harmonica with him at all times.
6278563	eng	Tom was on the balcony.
6278564	eng	Tom carries a harmonica with him all the time.
6278565	eng	Tom and Mary were playing tennis this morning.
6278566	eng	Tom and Mary wanted to spend all day together.
6278567	eng	Tom and Mary used to often do things together.
6278568	eng	Tom is supposed to do that by himself.
6278569	eng	Tom and Mary talked until 2:30 in the morning.
6278570	eng	Tom and Mary talked about all kinds of things.
6278571	eng	Tom already knows what Mary is planning to do.
6278572	eng	Tom almost always goes to bed before midnight.
6278573	eng	The police have no other evidence against Tom.
6278574	eng	The only bed Tom has ever slept in is his own.
6278575	eng	No one knows exactly where Tom is going to go.
6278576	eng	Last night, Tom went to sleep before midnight.
6278577	eng	I think Tom might not want to do that.
6278578	eng	I'm sure Tom won't want to go fishing with us.
6278579	eng	I'd rather go shopping with you than with Tom.
6278580	eng	Tom says he just wanted to be loved.
6278581	eng	I think Tom could get Mary to do that.
6278582	eng	I wonder what inspired Tom to write that song?
6278583	eng	I was hoping Tom wouldn't ask me to help Mary.
6278584	eng	Tom heard Mary snoring.
6278585	eng	I thought Tom was going to tell me what to do.
6278586	eng	I hope Tom didn't do what you asked him to do.
6278587	eng	I hope Tom didn't do what Mary told him to do.
6278588	eng	Tom was probably very tired when he got home.
6278589	eng	Tom said he needed to buy something for Mary.
6278590	eng	Tom said he had to buy some flowers for Mary.
6278591	eng	Why did Tom apologize?
6278592	eng	Would it be OK to ask Tom to do that?
6278593	eng	Tom realized he no longer needed to be there.
6278594	eng	Why doesn't Tom want Mary to do that?
6278595	eng	Tom must've been very tired when he got home.
6278596	eng	Tom took his coat off.
6278597	eng	What makes you think Tom can do that?
6278598	eng	Tom hasn't done everything we told him to do.
6278599	eng	Tom hasn't done everything he was told to do.

6278613	eng	Tom told me that I shouldn't do that.
6278614	eng	I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
6278615	eng	Tom will do it again.
6278616	eng	I hope Tom didn't do what you told him to do.
6278617	eng	Can you do me a favor and take Tom to school?
6278618	eng	At first, Tom thought Mary was John's sister.
6278619	eng	Tom was the one who told me where you lived.
6278620	eng	Tom was scared to go in the cave by himself.
6278621	eng	Tom was lying to Mary when he told her that.
6278622	eng	Tom said he'd never let Mary do that.
6278623	eng	Tom was arrested when he crossed the border.
6278624	eng	Tom said he was unwilling to do that.
6278625	eng	Tom wanted Mary to meet some of his friends.
6278626	eng	Tom told Mary everything she wanted to know.
6278627	eng	Tom thought he had come up with a good plan.
6278628	eng	Tom should've given Mary a birthday present.
6278629	eng	Tom knows he shouldn't do that again.
6278630	eng	Tom said he was tired and wanted to go home.

6278636	eng	Tom left Boston a few days before Christmas.
6278637	eng	Tom knew things about Mary that John didn't.
6278638	eng	I think that's why I don't like Tom.
6278639	eng	Tom knew that something was about to happen.
6278640	eng	Tom knew that it was about to start raining.
6278641	eng	I think Tom will do a very good job.

6278653	eng	Tom has made several bad decisions recently.
6278654	eng	Tom has been playing his guitar all morning.
6278655	eng	Tom wasn't in bed.
6278656	eng	Tom has been helping Mary with her homework.
6278657	eng	Tom had no idea that he was being too noisy.
6278658	eng	Tom does that the same way Mary does.
6278659	eng	Tom had enough time to do what he had to do.
6278660	eng	Tom gave the robbers everything they wanted.
6278661	eng	Tom gave Mary a kiss and got out of the car.
6278662	eng	Tom found out that Mary was a married woman.
6278663	eng	Tom doesn't know how to apologize in French.
6278664	eng	Those are Tom's.
6278665	eng	Tom didn't want anyone to see him with Mary.
6278666	eng	All Tom wanted was some free time.
6278667	eng	Did Tom really do that without anyone's help?
6278668	eng	Did Tom really do that without anybody's help?
6278669	eng	Tom didn't know what he was going to do yet.
6278670	eng	Tom didn't yet know what he was going to do.
6278671	eng	Tom drives his children to school every day.
6278672	eng	Tom had much more money than Mary.
6278673	eng	Tom has much more money than Mary.
6278674	eng	Tom put his glasses on.
6278675	eng	I think Tom is going to do that again.
6278676	eng	The police were at the scene when Tom arrived.
6278677	eng	I don't think Tom did that correctly.
6278678	eng	Tom and Mary were unable to help John do that.
6278679	eng	Tom and Mary weren't able to help me do that.
6278680	eng	Tom and Mary couldn't help me.
6278681	eng	I won't go there.
6278682	eng	Tom isn't going to be mad if Mary does that.
6278683	eng	Tom isn't really planning to do that, is he?
6278684	eng	I won't stay here.
6278685	eng	Who did Tom think would cook dinner for him?
6278686	eng	Tom isn't the only one here who can do that.
6278687	eng	Do you think Tom will be here this afternoon?
6278688	eng	Tom made me swear not to ever do that again.
6278689	eng	I don't think Tom enjoys hanging out with us.
6278690	eng	Who did you visit?
6278691	eng	Tom realized he no longer needed to do that.
6278692	eng	I think I shouldn't have told Tom about that.
6278693	eng	Why are you naked?
6278694	eng	Tom said he'd rather not do that by himself.
6278695	eng	I think Tom is a lot better swimmer than you.
6278696	eng	Tom says he'll do that if Mary wants him to.
6278697	eng	I thought it might be too early to visit Tom.
6278698	eng	I live in the dorm.
6278699	eng	Tom thinks Mary will probably never do that.
6278700	eng	I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
6278701	eng	Tom tried to do that, but he wasn't able to.
6278702	eng	I was hoping Tom wouldn't ask me to help him.
6278703	eng	I'll be right home.
6278704	eng	Tom will do that first thing in the morning.
6278705	eng	Mary was the only girl Tom ever really loved.
6278706	eng	Tom will do that for you if you want him to.
6278707	eng	Please try to talk Tom into joining our team.
6278708	eng	I made you some tea.
6278709	eng	Tom will get mad if you don't do that today.
6278710	eng	Tom and Mary have been arguing all afternoon.
6278711	eng	What makes you think Tom would ever do that?
6278712	eng	I worked hard today.
6278713	eng	Tom and Mary talked about all kinds of stuff.
6278714	eng	Why Tom did that is beyond my comprehension.
6278715	eng	Tom and Mary used to sing together at a club.
6278716	eng	Why should Tom need Mary to do that for him?
6278717	eng	Tom burned all the letters Mary had sent him.
6278718	eng	I've got to go home.
6278719	eng	Why would Tom do that if he doesn't have to?
6278720	eng	Would you be good enough to do that for Tom?
6278721	eng	Tom didn't know Mary thought he should leave.
6278722	eng	Would you know if Tom is allowed to do that?
6278723	eng	We talked for hours.
6278724	eng	Do you think Tom would care if Mary did that?
6278725	eng	Tom forgot to buy what Mary asked him to buy.
6278726	eng	Will you forgive me?
6278727	eng	I don't think Tom will ever start doing that.
6278728	eng	Tom isn't going to come back to pick Mary up.
6278729	eng	I don't think Tom would mind if you did that.
6278730	eng	I hope we don't lose.
6278731	eng	Tom knew that Mary didn't like him very much.
6278732	eng	I think Tom may not be able to do that today.
6278733	eng	Tom knew that Mary didn't want to drink beer.
6278734	eng	Tom knew that Mary was likely to not be busy.
6278735	eng	I made a good choice.
6278736	eng	I was hoping Tom wouldn't tell me to do that.
6278737	eng	Tom still doesn't know what needs to be done.
6278738	eng	I wonder when Tom showed Mary how to do that.
6278739	eng	Tom took Mary to the best restaurant in town.
6278740	eng	You don't have to digitize everything, Tom.
6278741	eng	I wonder why Tom told me I needed to do that.
6278742	eng	Tom was the one who told me where Mary lived.
6278743	eng	You have a nice home.
6278744	eng	I wonder why Tom told me I shouldn't do that.
6278745	eng	Tom was unable to do what we asked him to do.
6278746	eng	I'm not sure whether Tom will do that or not.
6278747	eng	Tom was very nervous when that was happening.
6278748	eng	I'm not surprised that Tom wanted to do that.
6278749	eng	I felt bad about that.
6278750	eng	Tom went to the beach with Mary last weekend.
6278751	eng	I'm quite certain Tom did that intentionally.
6278752	eng	Too bad Tom isn't here to show us what to do.
6278753	eng	What time did Tom say he wanted to get there?
6278754	eng	The toast looks burnt.
6278755	eng	Maybe you shouldn't do that with Tom anymore.
6278756	eng	When I told Tom that, he didn't say anything.
6278757	eng	Tom and Mary were always doing that together.
6278758	eng	Where's your umbrella?
6278759	eng	Who did Tom think would lend him an umbrella?
6278760	eng	Tom didn't want anyone to see him doing that.
6278761	eng	Who gave Tom permission to borrow my bicycle?
6278762	eng	Tom does that the way Mary told him to do it.
6278763	eng	I didn't realize that Tom was married to Mary.
6278764	eng	You have a nice house.
6278765	eng	Tom heard Mary say that she couldn't do that.
6278766	eng	I don't think Tom would be willing to help us.
6278767	eng	Tom informed Mary that she shouldn't do that.
6278768	eng	I hope Tom likes the present I bought for him.
6278769	eng	Tom is going to try to find a way to do that.
6278770	eng	I think you should write Tom a thank you note.
6278771	eng	Tom knew Mary didn't have to do that anymore.
6278772	eng	I thought you knew Tom graduated from Harvard.
6278773	eng	Tom checked three books out from the library.
6278774	eng	Tom heard Mary and John talking about Alice.
6278775	eng	Tom, Mary, John and Alice all enjoy dancing.
6278776	eng	Tom, Mary, John and Alice are all Canadians.
6278777	eng	Tom, Mary, John and Alice all live in Boston.
6278778	eng	Tom, Mary, John and Alice came here together.
6278779	eng	Tom, Mary, John and Alice are all from Boston.
6278780	eng	Tom and John are married to sisters.
6278781	eng	Tom is sitting between Mary and John.
6278782	eng	I think Tom will ask Mary to do that for John.
6278783	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to say anything to John.
6278784	eng	Who told Tom to ask Mary to help John do that?
6278785	eng	You should do what you can.
6278786	eng	I like hot coffee.
6278787	eng	It's not easy to do that.
6278788	eng	It wasn't easy to do that.
6278789	eng	That wasn't very hard to do.
6278790	eng	It wasn't hard to convince Tom not to do that.
6278791	eng	I know it wasn't difficult for Tom to do that.
6278792	eng	Tom was unjustly accused of the crime.
6278793	eng	This door is the only exit.
6278794	eng	This is the only way in.
6278795	eng	This is the only way out.
6278796	eng	The mist is clearing.
6278797	eng	You really should do that now.
6278798	eng	We don't need any more chairs.
6278799	eng	If you want to do that, do it.
6278800	eng	You'll have to do that again.
6278801	eng	You should be doing that now.
6278802	eng	We don't need any more money.
6278803	eng	I really should've done that.
6278804	eng	You should be quiet in here.
6278805	eng	You need to do that quickly.
6278806	eng	We don't need any more time.
6278807	eng	That didn't make much sense.
6278808	eng	I really should do that now.
6278809	eng	I knew you wouldn't do that.
6278810	eng	I had the right to say that.
6278811	eng	Tom and Mary are expecting their second child.
6278812	eng	Digging is hard work.
6278813	eng	Tom wants to follow in his father's footsteps.
6278814	eng	Give me everything you have.
6278815	eng	You're supposed to do that.
6278816	eng	You should be in your room.
6278817	eng	Please don't ever leave me.
6278818	eng	I'll find a way to do that.
6278819	eng	I had the right to do that.
6278820	eng	I dreamed about doing that.
6278821	eng	I don't want any more cats.
6278822	eng	You really should do that.
6278823	eng	You need to do that today.
6278824	ukr	Том весь вечір дивиться телевізор.
6278825	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно зробити.
6278826	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно робити.
6278827	ukr	Том зараз, мабуть, зайнятий.
6278828	ukr	Том однозначно наляканий.
6278829	ukr	Немає сумніву, що Том переляканий.
6278830	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали зробити.
6278831	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали.
6278832	ukr	Я уяви не мав, що Том це робитиме.
6278833	ukr	Я уяви не мала, що Том це робитиме.
6278834	ukr	Том запевнив мене, що пістолет незаряджений.
6278835	ukr	Яким чином ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278836	ukr	Як ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278837	ukr	Том вийшов з води.
6278838	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб Том це для тебе зробив?
6278839	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб це для тебе зробив Том?
6278840	ukr	Том погодився зустріти Мері після школи.
6278841	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно допомогти Тому.
6278842	ukr	Я думав, що Мері сподобається Тому.
6278843	ukr	Я думаю, тобі слід піти туди з Томом.
6278844	ukr	Я думаю, вам слід піти туди з Томом.
6278845	ukr	Я думаю, що Том минулого тижня їздив до Бостона.
6278846	ukr	Я думаю, Том казав неправду.
6278847	ukr	Я думаю, Том сказав нам неправду.
6278848	ukr	Тому не дозволять це знову зробити.
6278849	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше сьогодні вдень.
6278850	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо Мері захоче, щоб він це зробив.
6278851	ukr	Том знову здоровий.
6278852	ukr	Том намагався це зробити, але не зміг.
6278853	ukr	Том чмокнув Мері й сів у автобус.
6278854	ukr	Том не пам'ятає нічого з тієї ночі.
6278855	ukr	Том сказав, що він би краще цього тут не робив.
6278856	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері варить спагеті.
6278857	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері робить спагеті.
6278858	ukr	Мікроавтобус Тома припаркований біля будинку.
6278859	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж зробить це.
6278860	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж робитиме це.
6278861	ukr	Том чув, як Мері кричала.
6278862	ukr	У Тома недостатньо грошей, щоб купити квиток.
6278863	ukr	Том сказав, що він не бажає цього робити.
6278864	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері їхала з ним до Бостона.
6278865	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері поїхала з ним до Бостона.
6278866	ukr	Том не зрозумів, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278867	ukr	Том не усвідомлював, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278868	ukr	Том може зазнати травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278869	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня.
6278870	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня жінка.
6278871	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері сиділа.
6278872	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері ніколи не була в Бостоні.
6278873	ukr	Том завжди має при собі губну гармоніку.
6278874	ukr	Том був на балконі.
6278875	ukr	Том та Мері того ранку грали у теніс.
6278876	ukr	Том та Мері хотіли провести весь день разом.
6278877	ukr	Том та Мері колись все робили разом.
6278878	ukr	Тому має це зробити сам.
6278879	ukr	Том та Мері балакали до 2:30 ночі.
6278880	ukr	Том та Мері розмовляли до 2:30 ночі.
6278881	ukr	Том та Мері балакали про всяке-різне.
6278882	ukr	Том та Мері розмовляли про всяке-різне.
6278883	ukr	Том уже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278884	ukr	Том завжди йде спати до полуночі.
6278885	ukr	У поліції більше немає улік проти Тома.
6278886	ukr	У поліції немає жодних інших улік проти Тома.
6278887	ukr	Єдине ліжко, у якому Том коли-небудь спав, — це його власне.
6278888	ukr	Ніхто точно не знає, куди піде Том.
6278889	ukr	Учора ввечері Том пішов спати раніше полуночі.
6278890	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти цього робити.
6278891	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти це зробити.
6278892	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче піти з нами риболовити.
6278893	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з тобою, ніж з Томом.
6278894	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з вами, ніж з Томом.
6278895	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів, щоб його кохали.
6278896	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів кохання.
6278897	ukr	Я думаю, Том може переконати Мері зробити це.
6278898	ukr	Цікаво, що надихнуло Тома написати цю пісню?
6278899	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278900	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278901	ukr	Том чув, як Мері хропіла.
6278902	ukr	Том чув хропіння Мері.
6278903	ukr	Я думав, що Том скаже мені, що робити.
6278904	ukr	Я гадала, що Том скаже мені, що робити.
6278905	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросив.
6278906	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросила.
6278907	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що його попросила Мері.
6278908	ukr	Том був, мабуть, дуже втомлений, коли він прийшов додому.
6278909	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно щось купити Мері.
6278910	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно купити Мері квіти.
6278911	ukr	Чому Том вибачався?
6278912	ukr	Чому Том вибачився?
6278913	ukr	Можна попросити Тома це зробити?
6278914	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278915	ukr	Том усвідомив, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278916	ukr	Чому том не хоче, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278917	ukr	Том, мабуть, був дуже втомлений, коли прийшов додому.
6278918	ukr	Том зняв пальто.
6278919	ukr	Том зняв куртку.
6278920	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том може це зробити?
6278921	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том може це зробити?
6278922	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що ми його попросили.
6278923	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що його попросили.
6278924	ukr	Том би ніколи не сказав Мері зробити цього.
6278925	ukr	Том отримав певну кількість листів від Мері.
6278926	ukr	Том не знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278927	ukr	Том та Мері не танцювали одне з одним.
6278928	ukr	Том та Мері пішли до дорогого ресторану.
6278929	ukr	Том ніколи не дозволить, щоб ти це знову зробив.
6278930	ukr	Том ніколи не дозволить, щоб ти це знову зробила.
6278931	ukr	Тому потрібно було багато чого купити.
6278932	ukr	Том зробить це, коли буде його черга.
6278933	ukr	Том зробить це, коли настане його черга.
6278934	ukr	Єдина особа, з цим Том хоче говорити, — це Мері.
6278935	ukr	Єдина особа, з ким Том розмоваляє, — це Мері.
6278936	ukr	Єдина книга, яку читає Том, — це Біблія.
6278937	ukr	Том чув гучний звук.
6278938	ukr	Том почув гучний звук.
6278939	ukr	Я думав, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278940	ukr	Я думала, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278941	ukr	Том сказав мені, що мені не слід цього робити.
6278942	ukr	Я думав, що Том дасть Мері квіти.
6278943	ukr	Я думав, що Том подарує Мері квіти.
6278944	ukr	Том зробить це знову.
6278945	ukr	Можеш зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278946	ukr	Можети зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278947	ukr	Спочатку Том думав, що Мері — сестра Джона.
6278948	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ти живеш.
6278949	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ви живете.
6278950	ukr	Том боявся йти до печери один.
6278951	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй це сказав.
6278952	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй про це розповів.
6278953	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволить Мері зробити це.
6278954	ukr	Тома заарештували, коли він перетинав кордон.
6278955	ukr	Том хотів, щоб Мері познайомилася з деякими з його друзів.
6278956	ukr	Том розповів Мері все, що вона хотіла знати.
6278957	ukr	Том гадав, що придумав добрий план.
6278958	ukr	Тому слід було подарувати Мері подарунок на день народження.
6278959	ukr	Том знає, що йому не слід це знову робити.
6278960	ukr	Том сказав, що втомився й хоче додому.
6278961	ukr	Том сказав, що втомився й піти додому.
6278962	ukr	Том знав, що мусить допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278963	ukr	Том прочитав всі книжки зі шкільної бібліотеки.
6278964	ukr	Том зараз знає правду про те, що сталося.
6278965	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це був не я.
6278966	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це була не я.
6278967	ukr	Том тепер знає правду про те, як померла Мері.
6278968	ukr	Том поїхав з Бостона за кілька днів до Різдва.
6278969	ukr	Том знав про Мері те, чого не знав Джон.
6278970	ukr	Я думаю, тому я й не люблю Тома.
6278971	ukr	Я думаю, тому мені й не подобається Том.
6278972	ukr	Том знав, що щось ось-ось трапиться.
6278973	ukr	Том знав, що щось ось-ось станеться.
6278974	ukr	Том знав, що ось-ось піде дощ.
6278975	ukr	Я думаю, Том дуже добре справиться з роботою.
6278976	ukr	Том знав, що його навряд чи оберуть.
6278977	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи зайнята.
6278978	ukr	Том знав, що може трапитися щось погане.
6278979	ukr	Том знав, що може статися щось погане.
6278980	ukr	Том — герой Мері.
6278981	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде в офісі.
6278982	ukr	Том все ще злиться?
6278983	ukr	Том добре вміє тримати речі на голові.
6278984	ukr	Том лише готується це зробити.
6278985	ukr	У Тома серйозні психологічні проблеми.
6278986	ukr	Том отримав багато листів від Мері.
6278987	ukr	Кого відвідав Том?
6278988	ukr	У кого був Том?
6278989	ukr	У Тома нещодавно було кілька поганих рішень.
6278990	ukr	Том нещодавно прийняв кілька поганих рішень.
6278991	ukr	Том весь рано грає на гітарі.
6278992	ukr	Тома не було у ліжку.
6278993	ukr	Том допомагає Мері зробити домашню роботу.
6278994	ukr	Том гадки не мав, що він занадто пронозливий.
6278995	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як і Мері.
6278996	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як Мері.
6278997	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він мав зробити.
6278998	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він повинен зробити.
6278999	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникав усе, що вони хотіли.
6279000	ukr	Том поцілував Мері та вийшов з машини.
6279001	ukr	Том дізнався, що Мері заміжня.
6279002	ukr	Том не знає, як вибачитися французькою.
6279003	ukr	Том не знає, як вибачатися французькою.
6279004	ukr	Ось ці належать Тому.
6279005	ukr	Вони належать Тому.
6279006	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб його бачили з Мері.
6279007	ukr	Все, що хотів Том, — трохи вільного часу.
6279008	ukr	Том ще не знав, що робитиме.
6279009	ukr	Кожного дня Том відвозить дітей до школи.
6279010	ukr	У Тома було набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279011	ukr	У Тома набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279012	ukr	Том одягнув окуляри.
6279013	ukr	Дмаю, Том зробить це знову.
6279014	ukr	Коли Том приїхав, поліція була вже на місці.
6279015	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том зробив це правильно.
6279016	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону зробити це.
6279017	ukr	Том та Мері не могли допомогти Джону зробити це.
6279018	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279019	ukr	Том та Мері не могли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279020	ukr	Я туди не піду.
6279021	ukr	Том не злитиметься, якщо Мері це зробить.
6279022	ukr	Том не планує насправді цього робити, чи не так?
6279023	ukr	Том же не планує насправді цього робити?
6279024	ukr	Я тут не лишуся.
6279025	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, буде готувати йому вечерю?
6279026	ukr	Том не єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6279027	ukr	Гадаєш, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279028	ukr	Ви думаєте, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279029	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я ніколи більше цього не робитиму.
6279030	ukr	Кого ти відвідав?
6279031	ukr	У кого ти був?
6279032	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже не потрібно це робити.
6279033	ukr	Гадаю, мені не варто було говорити Тому про це.
6279034	ukr	Чому ти голий?
6279035	ukr	Чому ти гола?
6279036	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це один.
6279037	ukr	Думаю, Том набагато краще від тебе плаває.
6279038	ukr	Гадаю, Том набагато краще від вас плаває.
6279039	ukr	Том каже, що зробить це, якщо цього захоче Мері.
6279040	ukr	Я думав, ще може бути зарано, щоб зайти до Тома.
6279041	ukr	Я живу у гуртожитку.
6279042	ukr	Том думає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не зробить.
6279043	ukr	Том гадає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не робитиме.
6279044	ukr	Я думав, що Ти знаєш, що Том та Мері одружені.
6279045	ukr	Том спробував зробити це, але не зміг.
6279046	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене йому допомагати.
6279047	ukr	Том зробить це першим ділом вранці.
6279048	ukr	Мері була першою дівчиною, яку Том коли-небудь кохав.
6279049	ukr	Том зробить це для тебе, якщо захочеш.
6279050	ukr	Том зробить це для вас, якщо захочете.
6279051	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуй умовити Тома приєднатися до нашої команди.
6279052	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуйте умовити Тома вступити до нашої команди.
6279053	ukr	Я зробив тобі чаю.
6279054	ukr	Я зробила вам чаю.
6279055	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ви цього не зробите сьогодні.
6279056	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ти цього не зробиш сьогодні.
6279057	ukr	Том та Мері сперечаються весь день.
6279058	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том це коли-небудь робитиме?
6279059	ukr	Я сьогодні багато працював.
6279060	ukr	Том та Мері говорили про всяке-різне.
6279061	ukr	Чому Том зробив це — поза моїм розумінням.
6279062	ukr	Том та Мері колись співали разом у клубі.
6279063	ukr	Чому Тому потрібна Мері, щоб зробити це для нього?
6279064	ukr	Том спалив усі листи, які надіслала йому Мері.
6279065	ukr	Я маю йти додому.
6279066	ukr	Мушу вже йти додому.
6279067	ukr	Чому б Том робив це, якщо він не має цього робити?
6279068	ukr	Ти не міг би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279069	ukr	Ви не могли би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279070	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері гадає, що йому треба піти.
6279071	ukr	Ти б знав, якби Тому можна було це зробити?
6279072	ukr	Ти б знала, якби Тому можна було це робити?
6279073	ukr	Ми балакали годинами.
6279074	ukr	Ми говорили годинами.
6279075	ukr	Думаєш, Том не заперечував би проти того, щоб Мері це зробила?
6279076	ukr	Том забув купити те, про що його попросила Мері.
6279077	ukr	Ти мене пробачиш?
6279078	ukr	Ви мене пробачите?
6279079	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том коли-небудь почне це робити.
6279080	ukr	Том не повернеться, щоб забрати Мері.
6279081	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ти це зробив.
6279082	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ви це зробили.
6279083	ukr	Сподіваюся, ми не програємо.
6279084	ukr	Том знав, що не дуже подобається Мері.
6279085	ukr	Думаю, Том, можливо, не зможе цього сьогодні зробити.
6279086	ukr	Том знав, що Мері не хоче пити пиво.
6279087	ukr	Том знав, що Мері, скоріш за все, не зайнята.
6279088	ukr	Я зробив добрий вибір.
6279089	ukr	Я зробила добрий вибір.
6279090	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не скаже мені це робити.
6279091	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що потрібно зробити.
6279092	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що треба зробити.
6279093	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том показав Мері, як це робиться?
6279094	ukr	Том запросив Мері у найдорожчий ресторан у місті.
6279095	ukr	Тобі не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279096	ukr	Вам не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279097	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені потрібно це зробити.
6279098	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де живе Мері.
6279099	ukr	У тебе гарний дім.
6279100	ukr	У тебе гарна оселя.
6279101	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені не треба цього робити.
6279102	ukr	Том не зміг зробити того, про що ми його попросили.
6279103	ukr	Я не певен, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279104	ukr	Я не певна, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279105	ukr	Том був дуже знервований, коли це відбувалося.
6279106	ukr	Я не здивований, що Том хоче це зробити.
6279107	ukr	Я не здивована, що Том хоче це зробити.
6279108	ukr	У мене було погане відчуття щодо цього.
6279109	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері пішли на пляж.
6279110	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері ходили на пляж.
6279111	ukr	Я певен, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279112	ukr	Я певна, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279113	ukr	Шкода, що Тома немає тут, щоб показати нам, що робити.
6279114	ukr	Том сказав, що він хоче бути там о котрій годині?
6279115	ukr	Тост виглядає так, ніби згорів.
6279116	ukr	Грінка виглядає ніби згоріла.
6279117	ukr	Можливо, тобі не варто це більше робити з Томом.
6279118	ukr	Коли я розповів про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279119	ukr	Коли я розповіла про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279120	ukr	Том та Мері завжди робили це разом.
6279121	ukr	Де твоя парасолька?
6279122	ukr	Де ваша парасолька?
6279123	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, позичить йому парасольку?
6279124	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб хто-небудь бачив, як він це робить.
6279125	ukr	Хто дозволив Тому взяти мій велосипед?
6279126	ukr	Том робить це так, як його навчила Мері.
6279127	ukr	Я не розумів, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279128	ukr	Я не усвідомлювала, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279129	ukr	У тебе гарний будинок.
6279130	ukr	У вас гарний будинок.
6279131	ukr	Том чув, що Мері сказала, що не може цього зробити.
6279132	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том бажав би нам допомогти.
6279133	ukr	Том проінформував Мері, що вона не має цього робити.
6279134	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купив.
6279135	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купила.
6279136	ukr	Том спробує знайти спосіб, як це зробити.
6279137	ukr	Думаю, тобі треба написати Тому лист-подяку.
6279138	ukr	Том знав, що Мері більше не мусить робити цього.
6279139	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279140	ukr	Я думала, що ви знаєте, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279141	ukr	Том взяв три книжки в бібліотеці.
6279142	ukr	Том чув, як Мері та Джон розмовляли про Еліс.
6279143	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс полюбляють танцювати.
6279144	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс люблять танці.
6279145	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс — канадійці.
6279146	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс живуть у Бостоні.
6279147	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс прийшли сюди разом.
6279148	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс приїхали сюди разом.
6279149	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс з Бостона.
6279150	ukr	Том та Джон одружені на сестрах.
6279151	ukr	Том сидить між Мері та Джоном.
6279152	ukr	Я думаю, Том попросить Мері зробити це для Джона.
6279153	ukr	Том не хоче, щоб Мері казала Джону будь-що.
6279154	ukr	Хто сказав Тому попросити Мері допомогти Джону зробити це?
6279155	ukr	Тобі слід зробити те, що ти можеш.
6279156	ukr	Вам слід зробити те, що ви можете.
6279157	ukr	Мені подобається гаряча кава.
6279158	ukr	Я люблю гарячу каву.
6279159	ukr	Це нелегко зробити.
6279160	ukr	Це було нелегко зробити.
6279161	ukr	Це було не дуже важко зробити.
6279162	ukr	Переконати Тома зробити це було неважко.
6279163	ukr	Переконати Тома зробити це було нескладно.
6279164	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було неважко це зробити.
6279165	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було нескладно це зробити.
6279166	ukr	Тома несправедливо звинуватили у злочині.
6279167	ukr	Ці двері — це єдиний вихід.
6279168	ukr	Це єдиний вхід.
6279169	ukr	Це єдиний вихід.
6279170	ukr	Туман розсіюється.
6279171	ukr	Тобі дійсно потрібно це зробити зараз.
6279172	ukr	Тобі дійсно зараз треба це зробити.
6279173	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно стільців.
6279174	ukr	Стільці більше не потрібні.
6279175	ukr	Якщо хочеш зробити це, зроби це.
6279176	ukr	Якщо хочете зробити це, зробіть це.
6279177	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно знову це зробити.
6279178	ukr	Вам буде потрібно зробити це знову.
6279179	ukr	Тобі слід це робити зараз.
6279180	ukr	Ти зараз повинен це робити.
6279181	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно грошей.
6279182	ukr	Я дійсно мав це зробити.
6279183	ukr	Я дійсно мала це зробити.
6279184	ukr	Тобі слід дотримуватися тут тиші.
6279185	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це швидко.
6279186	ukr	Вам слід зробити це швидко.
6279187	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно часу.
6279188	ukr	Це не мало багато сенсу.
6279189	ukr	Мені дійсно слід це зараз зробити.
6279190	ukr	Я знав, що ти цього не робитимеш.
6279191	ukr	Я знала, що ви цього не робитимете.
6279192	ukr	Я мав право це сказати.
6279193	ukr	Я мала право це сказати.
6279194	ukr	Том та Мері чекають на друг дитину.
6279195	ukr	Копати — важка праця.
6279196	ukr	Том хоче піти стопами свого батька.
6279197	ukr	Віддай мені все, що маєш.
6279198	ukr	Віддайте мені все, що маєте.
6279199	ukr	Тобі слід це зробити.

6279203	ukr	Будь ласка, ніколи не лишай мене.
6279204	ukr	Будь ласка, ніколи не залишайте мене.
6279205	ukr	Я придумаю, як це зробити.
6279206	ukr	Я мав право це зробити.
6279207	ukr	Я мала право це зробити.
6279208	ukr	Мені снилося, як я це робив.
6279209	ukr	Мені снилося, як я це робила.
6279210	ukr	Я не хочу більше котів.
6279211	ukr	Тобі дійсно слід це зробити.
6279212	ukr	Вам дійсно слід це зробити.
6279213	ukr	Тобі слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279214	ukr	Вам слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279215	eng	I was afraid I'd lose you.
6279216	eng	I should be in Boston now.
6279217	eng	I really should be in bed.

6279239	eng	I wish I could do that for you.
6279240	eng	These apples didn't cost much.
6279241	eng	I suppose you can do that, too.
6279242	eng	Mary lost her purse yesterday.
6279243	eng	I suggest that you do that now.
6279244	eng	Let's sing something together.
6279245	eng	I still don't enjoy doing that.
6279246	eng	I remember doing that with you.
6279247	eng	I went to the dance with Mary.
6279248	eng	Have you ever tried to do that?
6279249	eng	No one volunteered to do that.
6279250	eng	I've decided to do that again.
6279251	eng	We're not used so much noise.
6279252	eng	I'll definitely do that today.

6279267	eng	Where do you have to do that?
6279268	eng	These apples were expensive.
6279269	eng	We're not used to doing that.

6279300	eng	It's already getting dark.
6279301	eng	I think I've done that once.
6279302	eng	I really enjoy doing this.
6279303	eng	Everyone refused to do that.
6279304	eng	I really enjoy being here.
6279305	eng	Who should we do that with?
6279306	eng	How much do teachers make?
6279307	eng	Who could you do that with?
6279308	eng	When do we need to do that?
6279309	eng	When do we have to do that?
6279310	eng	Are you the one in charge?
6279311	eng	I'm not used to doing that.
6279312	eng	All these things are mine.
6279313	eng	I'm never doing that again.
6279314	eng	What are you doing later?
6279315	eng	I still hope I can do that.
6279316	eng	Please close the windows.
6279317	eng	I'm going to stop trying.
6279318	eng	I hope I can still do that.
6279319	eng	Haven't you ever done that?
6279320	eng	Why can't we do that, too?
6279321	eng	Who could we do that with?
6279322	eng	Aren't you going to vote?
6279323	eng	Maybe I can do that today.
6279324	eng	I think we should do that.
6279325	eng	These apples were cheap.
6279326	eng	I suppose you can do that.
6279327	eng	I know you didn't do that.
6279328	eng	Who's going to help us?
6279329	eng	I won't help you do that.
6279330	eng	Where should we do that?
6279331	eng	All this stuff is mine.
6279332	eng	Where could you do that?
6279333	eng	What's in your closet?
6279334	eng	I think I did that once.
6279335	eng	We're still in danger.
6279336	eng	I still plan to do that.
6279337	eng	The sun is already up.
6279338	eng	I still like doing that.
6279339	eng	Your shoes are dirty.
6279340	eng	I still hope to do that.
6279341	eng	We're still confused.
6279342	eng	Where could we do that?
6279343	eng	Nobody would help me.
6279344	eng	When could you do that?
6279345	eng	You can use my desk.
6279346	eng	Do you like carrots?
6279347	eng	You can use my pen.
6279348	eng	Can I do that for you?
6279349	eng	Who broke the dish?
6279350	eng	When could I do that?
6279351	eng	Let's switch seats.
6279352	eng	How could we do that?
6279353	eng	Let's change seats.
6279354	eng	Can we do that now?
6279355	eng	I bought a new hat.
6279356	eng	May I do that now?
6279357	eng	I'd like to do that someday.
6279358	eng	I want to do that someday.
6279359	eng	I want to do that soon.
6279360	eng	I want to do that this evening.
6279361	eng	Is that a leopard?
6279362	eng	Could we go faster? I'm late.
6279363	eng	Where can I find a cab?
6279364	eng	They ambushed us.
6279365	eng	I stayed up all night again.
6279366	eng	It's just impossible to do.
6279367	eng	What a sad thing to say.
6279368	eng	It was a bit awkward.
6279369	eng	Tom was out with his friends.
6279370	eng	It's a bomb.
6279371	eng	That's a bad pun.
6279372	eng	I walked downtown.
6279373	eng	Doing that was easy.
6279374	eng	I think we need this.
6279375	eng	It's really hot here.
6279376	eng	Doing that was tiring.
6279377	eng	It's really cold here.
6279378	eng	That's a very bad pun.
6279379	eng	This worries me a lot.

6279381	eng	It's really noisy here.
6279382	eng	It's really quiet here.
6279383	eng	I think we're all tired.
6279384	eng	I think you ought to go.
6279385	eng	I tried doing just that.
6279386	eng	I value your friendship.
6279387	eng	I was just about to eat.
6279388	eng	I wish I wasn't married.
6279389	eng	I've never seen the sea.
6279390	eng	What time is the break?
6279391	eng	What time do we finish work?
6279392	eng	What time do we start work?
6279393	eng	I wish that I could help.
6279394	eng	I'm sure that isn't true.
6279395	eng	I've been hungry all day.
6279396	eng	It's really cold in here.
6279397	eng	It's really damp in here.
6279398	eng	Let's eat lunch together.

6279512	ukr	Я боялася, що загублю вас.
6279513	ukr	Мені слід зараз бути в Бостоні.
6279514	ukr	Мені дійсно зараз треба бути у ліжку.
6279515	ukr	Не пий забагато вина.
6279516	ukr	Не пийте забагато вина.
6279517	ukr	Будь ласка, не будь таким галасливим.
6279518	ukr	Будь ласка, не будь такою галасливою.
6279519	ukr	Я не знаю, як допомогти.
6279520	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже сонним.
6279521	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже сонною.
6279522	ukr	Ці діти твої?

6279541	ukr	Цей собака ваш?
6279542	ukr	Цей собака твій?
6279543	ukr	Мені слід зробити це.
6279544	ukr	Хто нас врятує?

6279546	ukr	Дивись уважно, як я це роблю.
6279547	ukr	Спостерігайте уважно, як я це роблю.
6279548	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для тебе зробити.
6279549	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для вас зробити.
6279550	ukr	Ці яблука не були занадто дорогі.
6279551	ukr	Я думаю, ти теж можеш це зробити.
6279552	ukr	Я думаю, ви теж можете це зробити.
6279553	ukr	Учора Мері загубила свою сумочку.
6279554	ukr	Пропоную тобі зробити це зараз.
6279555	ukr	Пропоную вам зробити це зараз.
6279556	ukr	Давай заспіваєймо щось разом.
6279557	ukr	Заспіваймо щось разом.
6279558	ukr	Я все ще не отримаю задоволення від того, що роблю це.
6279559	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з тобою.
6279560	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з вами.
6279561	ukr	Я пішов з Мері на танці.
6279562	ukr	Ми з Мері пішли на танці.
6279563	ukr	Ти колись намагався це робити?
6279564	ukr	Ви колись намагалися це робити?
6279565	ukr	Ніхто не викликався добровольцем, щоб зробити це.
6279566	ukr	Я вирішив знову це зробити.
6279567	ukr	Я вирішила зробити це знову.
6279568	ukr	Ми не звиклі до такого гамору.
6279569	ukr	Я однозначно зроблю це сьогодні.
6279570	ukr	Ми готуємося піти.
6279571	ukr	Я би на твоєму місці зробив це.
6279572	ukr	Я би на вашому місці зробив це.
6279573	ukr	Покажи мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279574	ukr	Покажіть мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279575	ukr	Я все ще не хочу цього робити.
6279576	ukr	Мені подобається колір твоєї машини.
6279577	ukr	Мені подобається колір вашої машини.
6279578	ukr	Мені все ще не подобається це робити.
6279579	ukr	Сподіваюся, екзамен буде легкий.
6279580	ukr	Я купив нову пару взуття.
6279581	ukr	Я купив нове взуття.
6279582	ukr	Я не хочу сьогодні це робити.
6279583	ukr	Мені здається, тобі треба піти.
6279584	ukr	Мені здається, вам треба піти.
6279585	ukr	Ти прочитав усю книжку?
6279586	ukr	Ти прочитала усю книжку?
6279587	ukr	Ти все ще можеш це зробити?
6279588	ukr	Ви все ще можете це зробити?
6279589	ukr	Хіба не ти тут головний?
6279590	ukr	Хіба не ви тут головна?
6279591	ukr	Де тобі потрібно це зробити?
6279592	ukr	Де вам потрібно це зробити?
6279593	ukr	Де ти маєш це зробити?
6279594	ukr	Де ви маєте це зробити?
6279595	ukr	Ці яблука були дорогі.
6279596	ukr	Ми не звиклі до того, щоб це робити.
6279597	ukr	Думаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279598	ukr	Гадаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279599	ukr	Ніхто не допоміг би мені це зробити.
6279600	ukr	Мені насправді сподобалося тут бути.
6279601	ukr	Я закікавлений у тому, щоб це зробити.
6279602	ukr	Сподіваюся, я здам екзамен.
6279603	ukr	Я готуюся зробити це.
6279604	ukr	Шкода, що я більше не можу робити цього.
6279605	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш зробити паузу?
6279606	ukr	Я не поспішав це зробити.
6279607	ukr	Хто для нас готуватиме?
6279608	ukr	Думаю, нам не слід цього робити.
6279609	ukr	Я все ще шкодую, що не можу цього зробити.
6279610	ukr	Давай зіграємо партію у шахи.
6279611	ukr	Я колись мріяв про те, щоб зробити це.
6279612	ukr	Я колись мріяла про те, щоб зробити це.
6279613	ukr	Вже світлішає.
6279614	ukr	Я не знаю, хто може це зробити.
6279615	ukr	Я не міг утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279616	ukr	Я не могла утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279617	ukr	Я отримав багато задоволення від фільму.
6279618	ukr	Я отримала багато задоволення від фільму.
6279619	ukr	Я не думаю, що нам це потрібно.
6279620	ukr	Де нам потрібно це зробити?
6279621	ukr	Я тобі щось купив.
6279622	ukr	Я вам щось купила.
6279623	ukr	Де ми маємо це зробити?
6279624	ukr	Все ці олівці мої.
6279625	ukr	Коли нам потрібно це зробити?
6279626	ukr	Коли ти маєш це зробити?
6279627	ukr	Коли ви маєте це зробити?
6279628	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ти це зробив.
6279629	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ви це зробили.
6279630	ukr	Мері хотіла бути медсестрою.
6279631	ukr	Я б хотів, щоб я також це міг зробити.
6279632	ukr	Я б хотіла, щоб я також це могла зробити.
6279633	ukr	Вже темнішає.
6279634	ukr	Думаю, я це раз зробив.
6279635	ukr	Гадаю, я одного разу це зробила.
6279636	ukr	Я отримую багато задоволення, коли це роблю.
6279637	ukr	Всі відмовилися робити це.
6279638	ukr	Мені дуже сподобалося бути тут.
6279639	ukr	З ким нам слід це зробити?
6279640	ukr	Скільки заробляють учителі?
6279641	ukr	Скільки заробляють викладачі?
6279642	ukr	З ким ти міг би це зробити?
6279643	ukr	З ким ти могла би це зробити?
6279644	ukr	Коли ми маємо це зробити?
6279645	ukr	Ти тут головний?
6279646	ukr	Ви тут головна?
6279647	ukr	Я не звик до того, щоб це робити.
6279648	ukr	Я не звикла до того, щоб це робити.
6279649	ukr	Всі ці речі мої.
6279650	ukr	Я більше ніколи не робитиму.
6279651	ukr	Що ти робитимеш пізніше?
6279652	ukr	Що ви робитимите пізніше?
6279653	ukr	Я все ще сподіваюся, що зможу це зробити.
6279654	ukr	Прошу закрити вікна.
6279655	ukr	Закрийте вікна, будь ласка.
6279656	ukr	Обіцяю тобі, що я це зроблю.
6279657	ukr	Обіцяю вам, що зроблю це.
6279658	ukr	Я не буду більше намагатися.
6279659	ukr	Сподіваюся, я все ще можу це зробити.
6279660	ukr	Сподіваюся, я все ще вмію це робити.
6279661	ukr	Хіба ти ніколи цього не робив?
6279662	ukr	Хіба ви ніколи цього не робили?
6279663	ukr	Чому ми також не можемо цього зробити?
6279664	ukr	З ким ми могли б зробити це?
6279665	ukr	Хіба ти не голосуватимеш?
6279666	ukr	Хіба ви не будете голосувати?
6279667	ukr	Можливо, я зможу це зробити сьогодні.
6279668	ukr	Думаю, нам слід це зробити.
6279669	ukr	Ці яблука були дешеві.
6279670	ukr	Думаю, ти можеш це зробити.
6279671	ukr	Думаю, ви можете це зробити.
6279672	ukr	Я знаю, що ти цього не робив.

6285296	eng	Kepler has found that smaller planets (Earth-sized rather than Jupiter-sized) are likely to be the most common in the Milky Way galaxy.

6285301	eng	Astronomers also have used NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, which observes in infrared light, to study extrasolar planets. In 2007, the Spitzer telescope detected water vapor for the first time on another world.
6285302	eng	Hubble made one of the first visible-light images of an extrasolar planet circling the nearby, bright star Fomalhaut, located 25 light-years from Earth.
6285303	eng	Hubble also helped astronomers analyze the atmospheres of extrasolar planets.
6285304	eng	Hubble made the first measurements of the makeup of the atmospheres of two Jupiter-sized extrasolar planets.
6285305	eng	Even if a planet is rocky, Earth-sized, and just the right distance from its star, it also must have an atmosphere that contains the correct ingredients to foster and sustain life.

6287099	eng	Let's begin with capitalism, a word that has gone largely out of fashion. The approved reference now is to the market system. This shift minimizes — indeed, deletes — the role of wealth in the economic and social system. And it sheds the adverse connotation going back to Marx. Instead of the owners of capital or their attendants in control, we have the admirably impersonal role of market forces. It would be hard to think of a change in terminology more in the interest of those to whom money accords power.

6287109	eng	Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.
6287110	rus	Что там у них случилось?

6293960	eng	History has recorded many violent volcanic eruptions on Earth.
6293961	eng	In 1991, Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic outburst in the Philippines produced the second largest eruption of the 20th century. Ash from the blast was ejected as high as 21 miles above Earth. Particles from the eruption created a layer of sulfuric acid haze in Earth's atmosphere, dropping global temperatures by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit between 1991 and 1993.
6293962	eng	Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
6293963	eng	Olympus Mons, an inactive volcano on Mars, spreads over an area as large as the state of Arizona.

6293966	eng	Jupiter's moon, Io, has more than 400 active volcanoes, making it the most geologically active object in the solar system. Several volcanoes on Io produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that rise as high as 300 miles above its surface.
6293967	eng	Rivers are plentiful on Earth, and each river has a connection of streams that all flow into it. Some of Earth's solar-system neighbors show evidence that they once had similar river systems.
6293968	eng	Observations of Mars, Venus, and Titan reveal a series of thin channels that lead to larger channels. Although now dry, these channels could have once been river systems.
6293969	eng	Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.
6293970	eng	Earth's polar ice caps consist of water ice. Mars's polar caps, however, are a combination of water ice and carbon-dioxide ice.
6293971	eng	The Martian polar caps thaw in summer and freeze in winter, showing that our solar system's planets are dynamic and changing.

Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic.

It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.

It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."
