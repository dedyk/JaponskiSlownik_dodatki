6278031	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше, коли він буде не такий зайнятий.
6278032	ukr	Це зробив не Том. Це була Мері.
6278033	ukr	Том сказав мені, де він планував це робити.
6278034	ukr	Тому слід сказати Мері, що вона повинна це зробити.
6278035	ukr	Том сказав, що пам'ятає, що попросив Мері це зробити.
6278036	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібний спеціальний інструмент, щоб це зробити.
6278037	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері хоче це зробити.
6278038	ukr	Том вже знає, що Мері потрібно це зробити.
6278039	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що я цього не робитиму.
6278040	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері небагато грошей.
6278041	ukr	Я хотів сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278042	ukr	Я хотіла сказати Тому, що не можу цього зробити.
6278043	ukr	Том не дуже добре грає на піаніно.
6278044	ukr	Я думав, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278045	ukr	Я гадала, що Том допоможе Мері це зробити.
6278046	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати Мері зробити це.
6278047	ukr	Том ніколи не дізнається, хто це зробив.
6278048	ukr	Том запитає Мері, чи вона може це зробити.
6278049	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж Мері.
6278050	ukr	Том це робить набагато краще, ніж я.
6278051	ukr	Том придумав цікавий спосіб, як це зробити.
6278052	ukr	Том, здається, не поспішав цього робити.
6278053	ukr	Том не знав, що він має допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278054	ukr	Том та Мері були перші, хто це зробив.
6278055	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про тебе не розповідав.
6278056	ukr	Том та Мері завжди роблять це разом.
6278057	ukr	Том вже знає, чому Мері хоче це зробити.
6278058	ukr	Якщо ти розповіш Тому, як це зробити, він це зробить.
6278059	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає, як це зробити.
6278060	ukr	Я певен, що Том придумає спосіб, як це зробити.
6278061	ukr	Я не певен, чи може це Том зробити, чи ні.
6278062	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том запропонував нам це зробити сьогодні.
6278063	ukr	Цікаво, скільки людей бачило, як Том це робив.
6278064	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не проситиме мене робити це.
6278065	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не проситиме мене зробити це.
6278066	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері полетіла на дельтаплані.
6278067	ukr	Я думав, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278068	ukr	Я гадала, що Том навряд чи це зробить.
6278069	ukr	Я думаю, що саме Том сказав Мері це зробити.
6278070	ukr	Я думаю, Том, можливо, зможе це зробити для Мері.
6278271	ukr	Я думаю, що Том планує зробити це завтра.
6278272	ukr	Том знав, що він вже не потрібний.
6278273	ukr	Я думаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278274	ukr	Гадаю, Тому не дуже подобається це робити.
6278275	ukr	Я не мав уяви, що Том буде це робити.
6278276	ukr	Я не мала поняття, що Том буде це робити.
6278277	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том колись припинить це робити.
6278278	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь перестане це робити.
6278279	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це колись робив.
6278280	ukr	Не думаю, що Том коли-небудь це робив.
6278281	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том міг би переконати Мері це зробити.
6278282	ukr	Не думаю, що Том зміг переконати Мері це зробити.
6278283	ukr	Я не знаю, чи Том хое це робити, чи ні.
6278284	ukr	Я не знав, що Том це робитиме.
6278285	ukr	Я не знала, що Том це робитиме.
6278286	ukr	Хіба ти не питав Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278287	ukr	Хіба ти не запитала Тома, чому він цього не зробив?
6278288	ukr	Ти б сказав Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278289	ukr	Ти не міг би сказати Тому, чому Мері цього не зробила?
6278290	ukr	Навіщо Тому знадобилася би Мері, щоб це для нього зробити?
6278291	ukr	Чому Тому треба просити Мері це для нього зробити?
6278292	ukr	З якого дива Том хотів би це зробити?
6278293	ukr	Чому Том хоче марнувати на це час?
6278294	ukr	Том щойно втік із в'язниці.
6278295	ukr	Чому, на твою думку, Тому робитиме це?
6278296	ukr	Гадаю, Тома сьогодні тут не буде.
6278297	ukr	Тому було насправді необхідно це робити?
6278298	ukr	Том спробує дізнатися, чому Мері це зробила.
6278299	ukr	Том, можливо, зазнає травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278300	ukr	Том, імовірно, придумає, як це зробити.
6278301	ukr	Том ніколи за це не пробачить Мері.
6278302	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, там буде?
6278303	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей анекдот, ніхто не засміявся.
6278304	ukr	Коли Том розповів цей жарт, ніхто не засміявся.
6278305	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Тома там не буде?
6278306	ukr	Чому ви вважаєте, що Тома там не буде?
6278307	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще на столі.
6278308	ukr	Сонцезахисні окуляри Тома все ще лежать на столі.
6278309	ukr	Том був на вечірці до самого кінця.
6278310	ukr	Том думав, що у Мері доволі непоганий план.
6278311	ukr	Тому слід було сказати мені про це раніше.
6278312	ukr	У Тома не було достатньо сил, щоб зробити це.
6278313	ukr	Тому слід було бути ввічливішим.
6278314	ukr	Тому слід було бути більш чемним.
6278315	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув сказати про це Мері.
6278316	ukr	Том, мабуть, забув розповісти про це Мері.
6278317	ukr	Том щойно розповів мені, що треба було зробити.
6278318	ukr	Том просто розповів мені, що треба зробити.
6278319	ukr	Я думаю, Том цього теж не робитиме.
6278320	ukr	Навряд чи Том буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278321	ukr	Том готується до важливої події.
6278322	ukr	У лівій руці Том тримає ніж.
6278323	ukr	Том вирішив не ставати вчителем.
6278324	ukr	Що у той час робив Том?
6278325	ukr	Том весь час носить з собою зброю.
6278326	ukr	Дуже малоймовірно, що Том це зробить коли-небудь ще раз.
6278327	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язаний цього робити.
6278328	ukr	Том сказав мені, що я не зобов'язана цього робити.
6278329	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це сьогодні.
6278330	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278331	ukr	Том вже знає, що планує зробити Мері.
6278332	ukr	Є багато всього, чого Том не їстиме.
6278333	ukr	Тому насправді слід це робити просто зараз.
6278334	ukr	Том не натякає на те, що це зробила Мері, чи не так?
6278335	ukr	Я певен, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278336	ukr	Я певна, що Том нічого не хотітиме їсти.
6278337	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278338	ukr	Навряд чи Том забуде, як це робити.
6278339	ukr	Я думав, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278340	ukr	Я думала, що Тому тут сподобається.
6278341	ukr	Думаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278342	ukr	Гадаю, ми всі засмучені тим, що зробив Том.
6278343	ukr	Том вирішив ніколи більше цього не робити.
6278344	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тома не муситиме сидіти у в'язниці.
6278345	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросив.
6278346	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том зробив те, про що ти його попросила.
6278347	ukr	Том весь ранок провів у ліжку.
6278348	ukr	Том не розумів, що Мері не повинна цього робити.
6278349	ukr	Том не купив усе, що хотів.
6278350	ukr	Ти чув, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278351	ukr	Ти чула, як Том грає на гітарі?
6278352	ukr	Усі подумали, що Том канадієць.
6278353	ukr	Будь ласка, покажи Тому, як це робиться.
6278354	ukr	Будь ласка, покажіть Тому, як це зробити.
6278355	ukr	Я певен, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278356	ukr	Я певна, що Том не дозволив би мені цього зробити.
6278357	ukr	Мені цікаво, чому Том не отримує від цього задоволення.
6278358	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ти його попросиш.
6278359	ukr	Том зробить все, про що ви його попросите.
6278360	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том планував це зробити.
6278361	ukr	Тому хотів би, щоб у нього було більше друзів.
6278362	ukr	Думаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278363	ukr	Гадаю, Том не хоче робити цього сьогодні.
6278364	ukr	Том думав, що, можливо, сталося щось погане.
6278365	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том це робитиме ще.
6278366	ukr	Думаєш, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278367	ukr	Гадаєте, Том був би не проти, якщо я це зроблю?
6278368	ukr	Том увесь час плакав.
6278369	ukr	Том спить зі зброєю під подушкою.
6278370	ukr	Тому слід було б більше допомагати Мері.
6278371	ukr	Шкода, що Тома тут сьогодні не було, щоб це зробити.
6278372	ukr	Том спробує переконати Мері зробити це.
6278373	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи спізниться.
6278374	ukr	Том знав, що у Мері недостатньо грошей.
6278375	ukr	Том намагається познайомитися з новими друзями.
6278376	ukr	Тома звільнять, якщо він цього не зробить.
6278377	ukr	Том читає детектив.
6278378	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти йому за це заплатиш.
6278379	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви йому за це заплатите.
6278380	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ти його ввічливо попросиш.
6278381	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо ви його ввічливо попросите.
6278382	ukr	Звичайно ж Том спробує це зробити сьогодні.
6278383	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникам усе, що у нього було.
6278384	ukr	Том сказав, що ніколи не сказав би Мері цього робити.
6278385	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволив цього робити.
6278386	ukr	Том сказав, що з радістю це для тебе зробить.
6278387	ukr	Том зрозумів, що має допомогти Мері це зробити.
6278388	ukr	Том не знав, хто чоловік Мері.
6278389	ukr	Я чекаю, щоб Том пішов.
6278390	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я більше цього не робитиму.
6278391	ukr	Том та Мері разом пішли до тогрівельного центру.
6278392	ukr	Том та Мері колись ігнорували одне одного.
6278393	ukr	Малоймовірно, що Том забуде, як це робиться.
6278394	ukr	Це самий останній лист, написаний Томом.
6278395	ukr	Том єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6278396	ukr	Том все ще не дуже добре вміє це робити.
6278397	ukr	Саме це врешті-решт зробив Том.
6278398	ukr	Том не зміг би цього зробити без допомоги.
6278399	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не купуватиме цієї машини.
6278400	ukr	Це я переконав Тома зробити це.
6278401	ukr	Це я переконала Тома зробити це.
6278402	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278403	ukr	Я певна, що Том не захоче цього робити сьогодні.
6278404	ukr	Том чув якісь дивні звуки.
6278405	ukr	Том почув якісь дивні звуки.
6278406	ukr	Я попрошу Тома показати Мері, як це зробити.
6278407	ukr	Я попрошу Тома переконатися в тому, що Мері це робитиме.
6278408	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том планував це зробити.
6278409	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том хотів, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278410	ukr	Том дав Мері ще трохи грошей.
6278411	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278412	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том попросить мене це зробити.
6278413	ukr	Я сподіваюся, що Том зробив те, про що ми його попросили.
6278414	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що тобі не сподобається це робити.
6278415	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що вам не сподобається це робити.
6278416	ukr	Я думав, що Том, ймовірно, це зробить.
6278417	ukr	Я все ще відповідаю за Тома.
6278418	ukr	Я думаю, ось чому том хотів це зробити.
6278419	ukr	Думаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278420	ukr	Гадаю, що Том, можливо, зможе це зробити сьогодні.
6278421	ukr	З ким Том планував поїхати до Бостона?
6278422	ukr	Думаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278423	ukr	Гадаю, Том забув, як це робиться.
6278424	ukr	Том говорив по телефону.
6278425	ukr	Том балакав по телефону.
6278426	ukr	Я не думаю, що Тому сподобалося би це робити.
6278427	ukr	Тому було лячно йти на вулицю.
6278428	ukr	Тому було лячно йти надвір.
6278429	ukr	Думаєш, Том це коли-небудь буде робити знову?
6278430	ukr	Том зробить все, що необхідно зробити.
6278431	ukr	Ніхто не заперечує, якщо Том це зробить?
6278432	ukr	Том спробував закінчити те, що він робив.
6278433	ukr	Том намагався закінчити те, що він робив.
6278434	ukr	Чому ми з Томом не робимо цього зараз?
6278435	ukr	Коли Том показав тобі, як це робиться?
6278436	ukr	Коли Том показав вам, як це робиться?
6278437	ukr	Що б ти не робив, не роби цього з Томом.
6278438	ukr	Що б ти не робила, не роби цього з Томом.
6278439	ukr	Том сказав Мері жахливі речі.
6278440	ukr	Том сказав, що він починає втомлюватися.
6278441	ukr	Том вдягнений відповідно до ситуації.
6278442	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері його поцілує.
6278443	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може завдати йому біль.
6278444	ukr	Том ніколи не думав, що Мері може зробити йому боляче.
6278445	ukr	У Тома були проблеми в школі.
6278446	ukr	Тому буде потрібно зробити це в якомусь іншому місці.
6278447	ukr	Том знав, що Мере не з Бостона.
6278448	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи відмовиться.
6278449	ukr	Том однозначно цього більше не робитиме.
6278450	ukr	Том хотів зупинити Мері від того, щоб вона це зробила.
6278451	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що вона має це зробити.
6278452	ukr	Том наймолодший з трьох братів.
6278453	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що мона може це зробити.
6278454	ukr	Том наполегливо радив не робити цього.
6278455	ukr	Том сказав, що він все ще не готовий це робити.
6278456	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потбрібно допомоги Мері зробити це.
6278457	ukr	Том знає, що він цього аж ніяк не може зробити.
6278458	ukr	Том уяви не мав, що відбувалося.
6278459	ukr	Том знайшов няню для своїх дітей.
6278460	ukr	У Тома не було у Бостоні жодних друзів.
6278461	ukr	Том намагається не чхнути.
6278462	ukr	Том не вірив нічому, що говорила Мері.
6278463	ukr	Том не повірив ні у що, що розповіла Мері.
6278464	ukr	Том побачить, чи Мері зможе це зробити.
6278465	ukr	Том не зміг відчинити двері шафи.
6278466	ukr	Це не дуже добра ідея дозволити Тому зробити це.
6278467	ukr	У Тома завжди з собою його губна гармоніка.
6278468	ukr	Я повинен зараз допомагати Тому.
6278469	ukr	Я повинна зараз допомагати Тому.
6278470	ukr	Я б хотів знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278471	ukr	Я б хотіла знати, чому Том цього не зробив.
6278472	ukr	Том не це планує зробити.
6278473	ukr	Я сказав Тому, що ти не захочеш цього робити.
6278474	ukr	Я сказала Тому, що ви не захочете цього робити.
6278475	ukr	Я думав, що побачу тут Тома.
6278476	ukr	Я думала, що побачу тут Тома.
6278477	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278478	ukr	Я думала, що ти знаєш, що Том не може цього зробити.
6278479	ukr	У Тома все ще є що робити.
6278480	ukr	Я думаю, Том робив це одного разу чи двічі.
6278481	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том матимеме щось проти того, щоб це зробити.
6278482	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш знати, як Том це зробив?
6278483	ukr	Хіба ви не хочете знати, як Том це зробив?
6278484	ukr	Ти коли-небудь запитував Тома, як він це зробив?
6278485	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом приблизно не одного віку?
6278486	ukr	Хіба ви з Томом не ровесники?
6278487	ukr	Думаєш, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278488	ukr	Думаєте, Тому може сподобатися робити це?
6278489	ukr	Том і насправді зробив це без будь-якої допомоги?
6278490	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278491	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том цього не робитиме?
6278492	ukr	Будинок Тома був дуже гарний.
6278493	ukr	Том був переляканий, і я також.
6278494	ukr	Том сказав Мері, що треба зробити.
6278495	ukr	Том розповів Мері про те, що він зробив.
6278496	ukr	Том зможе це зробити один.
6278497	ukr	Це Том сказав мені це зробити.
6278498	ukr	Тому насправді варто було поснідати.
6278499	ukr	Том зрозумів, що був лише один вихід.
6278500	ukr	Том зрозумів, що він більше не потрібен.
6278501	ukr	Том лише учора ввечері зробив Мері пропозицію.
6278502	ukr	Том повинен був сказати Мері не робити цього.
6278503	ukr	Том грав у комп'ютерні ігри весь день.
6278504	ukr	Том каже, що хоче допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278505	ukr	Том ніколи нічого мені про вас не розповідав.
6278506	ukr	Том каже, що ще не готовий цього робити.
6278507	ukr	Том знав більше, ніж казав.
6278508	ukr	Том сказав, що йому краще це зробити наступного тижня.
6278509	ukr	Том сказав, що він би хотів, щоб це зробила Мері.
6278510	ukr	Том сказав, що більше ніколи цього не робитиме.
6278511	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде голодна.
6278512	ukr	Том сказав, що немає поспіху у тому, що він робить.
6278513	ukr	Том щойно зателефонував мені кілька хвилин тому.
6278514	ukr	Том не прийде жити з нами.
6278515	ukr	Том сказав, що не може втриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6278516	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат.
6278517	ukr	Це Том виростив цей салат-латук.
6278518	ukr	Том купив те, що хотів.
6278519	ukr	Том, імовірно, буде зайнятий після обіду.
6278520	ukr	Том завжди робить все, що може.
6278521	ukr	Том у своїй кімнаті, переодягається.
6278522	ukr	Кого хотів найняти Том?
6278523	ukr	Тому сподобається в Бостоні.
6278734	eng	Tom knew that Mary was likely to not be busy.
6278824	ukr	Том весь вечір дивиться телевізор.
6278825	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно зробити.
6278826	ukr	Том не знає, що йому потрібно робити.
6278827	ukr	Том зараз, мабуть, зайнятий.
6278828	ukr	Том однозначно наляканий.
6278829	ukr	Немає сумніву, що Том переляканий.
6278830	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали зробити.
6278831	ukr	Том зробив усе, що йому сказали.
6278832	ukr	Я уяви не мав, що Том це робитиме.
6278833	ukr	Я уяви не мала, що Том це робитиме.
6278834	ukr	Том запевнив мене, що пістолет незаряджений.
6278835	ukr	Яким чином ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278836	ukr	Як ти дізнався, що Том це зробив?
6278837	ukr	Том вийшов з води.
6278838	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб Том це для тебе зробив?
6278839	ukr	Ти б хотів, щоб це для тебе зробив Том?
6278840	ukr	Том погодився зустріти Мері після школи.
6278841	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно допомогти Тому.
6278842	ukr	Я думав, що Мері сподобається Тому.
6278843	ukr	Я думаю, тобі слід піти туди з Томом.
6278844	ukr	Я думаю, вам слід піти туди з Томом.
6278845	ukr	Я думаю, що Том минулого тижня їздив до Бостона.
6278846	ukr	Я думаю, Том казав неправду.
6278847	ukr	Я думаю, Том сказав нам неправду.
6278848	ukr	Тому не дозволять це знову зробити.
6278849	ukr	Том зробить це пізніше сьогодні вдень.
6278850	ukr	Том зробить це, якщо Мері захоче, щоб він це зробив.
6278851	ukr	Том знову здоровий.
6278852	ukr	Том намагався це зробити, але не зміг.
6278853	ukr	Том чмокнув Мері й сів у автобус.
6278854	ukr	Том не пам'ятає нічого з тієї ночі.
6278855	ukr	Том сказав, що він би краще цього тут не робив.
6278856	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері варить спагеті.
6278857	ukr	Тому не подобається, як Мері робить спагеті.
6278858	ukr	Мікроавтобус Тома припаркований біля будинку.
6278859	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж зробить це.
6278860	ukr	Том сказав, що він краще помре, ніж робитиме це.
6278861	ukr	Том чув, як Мері кричала.
6278862	ukr	У Тома недостатньо грошей, щоб купити квиток.
6278863	ukr	Том сказав, що він не бажає цього робити.
6278864	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері їхала з ним до Бостона.
6278865	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб Мері поїхала з ним до Бостона.
6278866	ukr	Том не зрозумів, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278867	ukr	Том не усвідомлював, що Мері — дівчина Джона.
6278868	ukr	Том може зазнати травми, якщо робитиме це.
6278869	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня.
6278870	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері заміжня жінка.
6278871	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері сиділа.
6278872	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері ніколи не була в Бостоні.
6278873	ukr	Том завжди має при собі губну гармоніку.
6278874	ukr	Том був на балконі.
6278875	ukr	Том та Мері того ранку грали у теніс.
6278876	ukr	Том та Мері хотіли провести весь день разом.
6278877	ukr	Том та Мері колись все робили разом.
6278878	ukr	Тому має це зробити сам.
6278879	ukr	Том та Мері балакали до 2:30 ночі.

6278883	ukr	Том уже знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278884	ukr	Том завжди йде спати до полуночі.
6278885	ukr	У поліції більше немає улік проти Тома.
6278886	ukr	У поліції немає жодних інших улік проти Тома.
6278887	ukr	Єдине ліжко, у якому Том коли-небудь спав, — це його власне.
6278888	ukr	Ніхто точно не знає, куди піде Том.
6278889	ukr	Учора ввечері Том заснув раніше опівночі.
6278890	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти цього робити.
6278891	ukr	Думаю, Том може не захотіти це зробити.
6278892	ukr	Я певен, що Том не захоче піти з нами риболовити.
6278893	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з тобою, ніж з Томом.
6278894	ukr	Я краще піду в магазин з вами, ніж з Томом.
6278895	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів, щоб його кохали.
6278896	ukr	Том каже, що він лише хотів кохання.
6278897	ukr	Я думаю, Том може переконати Мері зробити це.
6278898	ukr	Цікаво, що надихнуло Тома написати цю пісню?
6278899	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278900	ukr	Я сподівалася, що Том не попросить мене допомогти Мері.
6278901	ukr	Том чув, як Мері хропіла.
6278902	ukr	Том чув хропіння Мері.
6278903	ukr	Я думав, що Том скаже мені, що робити.
6278904	ukr	Я гадала, що Том скаже мені, що робити.
6278905	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросив.
6278906	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що ти його попросила.
6278907	ukr	Сподіваюся, Том не зробив того, про що його попросила Мері.
6278908	ukr	Том був, мабуть, дуже втомлений, коли він прийшов додому.
6278909	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно щось купити Мері.
6278910	ukr	Том сказав, що йому потрібно купити Мері квіти.
6278911	ukr	Чому Том вибачався?
6278912	ukr	Чому Том вибачився?
6278913	ukr	Можна попросити Тома це зробити?
6278914	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278915	ukr	Том усвідомив, що йому вже там бути не потрібно.
6278916	ukr	Чому том не хоче, щоб Мері це зробила?
6278917	ukr	Том, мабуть, був дуже втомлений, коли прийшов додому.
6278918	ukr	Том зняв пальто.
6278919	ukr	Том зняв куртку.
6278920	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том може це зробити?
6278921	ukr	Чому ви думаєте, що Том може це зробити?
6278922	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що ми його попросили.
6278923	ukr	Том зробив не все, про що його попросили.
6278924	ukr	Том би ніколи не сказав Мері зробити цього.
6278925	ukr	Том отримав певну кількість листів від Мері.
6278926	ukr	Том не знає, що планує робити Мері.
6278927	ukr	Том та Мері не танцювали одне з одним.

6278929	ukr	Том ніколи не дозволить, щоб ти це знову зробив.
6278930	ukr	Том ніколи не дозволить, щоб ти це знову зробила.
6278931	ukr	Тому потрібно було багато чого купити.
6278932	ukr	Том зробить це, коли буде його черга.
6278933	ukr	Том зробить це, коли настане його черга.
6278934	ukr	Єдина особа, з цим Том хоче говорити, — це Мері.
6278935	ukr	Єдина особа, про кого Том взагалі говорить, — це Мері.
6278936	ukr	Єдина книга, яку коли-небудь читав Том, — це Біблія.
6278937	ukr	Том чув гучний звук.
6278938	ukr	Том почув гучний звук.
6278939	ukr	Я думав, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278940	ukr	Я думала, що Том все ще вивчає французьку.
6278941	ukr	Том сказав мені, що мені не слід цього робити.
6278942	ukr	Я думав, що Том дасть Мері квіти.
6278943	ukr	Я думав, що Том подарує Мері квіти.
6278944	ukr	Том зробить це знову.
6278945	ukr	Можеш зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278946	ukr	Можети зробити мені послугу та відвести Тома до школи?
6278947	ukr	Спочатку Том думав, що Мері — сестра Джона.
6278948	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ти живеш.
6278949	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де ви живете.
6278950	ukr	Том боявся йти до печери один.
6278951	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй це сказав.
6278952	ukr	Том збрехав Мері, коли він їй про це розповів.
6278953	ukr	Том сказав, що він ніколи не дозволить Мері зробити це.
6278954	ukr	Тома заарештували, коли він перетинав кордон.
6278955	ukr	Том хотів, щоб Мері познайомилася з деякими з його друзів.
6278956	ukr	Том розповів Мері все, що вона хотіла знати.
6278957	ukr	Том гадав, що придумав добрий план.
6278958	ukr	Тому слід було подарувати Мері подарунок на день народження.
6278959	ukr	Том знає, що йому не слід цього знову робити.
6278960	ukr	Том сказав, що втомився й хоче додому.
6278961	ukr	Том сказав, що втомився і хоче піти додому.
6278962	ukr	Том знав, що мусить допомогти Мері зробити це.
6278963	ukr	Том прочитав всі книжки зі шкільної бібліотеки.
6278964	ukr	Том зараз знає правду про те, що сталося.
6278965	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це був не я.
6278966	ukr	Хтось інший розповів Тому. Це була не я.
6278967	ukr	Том тепер знає правду про те, як померла Мері.
6278968	ukr	Том поїхав з Бостона за кілька днів до Різдва.
6278969	ukr	Том знав про Мері те, чого не знав Джон.
6278970	ukr	Я думаю, тому я й не люблю Тома.
6278971	ukr	Я думаю, тому мені й не подобається Том.
6278972	ukr	Том знав, що щось ось-ось трапиться.
6278973	ukr	Том знав, що щось ось-ось станеться.
6278974	ukr	Том знав, що ось-ось піде дощ.
6278975	ukr	Я думаю, Том дуже добре справиться з роботою.
6278976	ukr	Том знав, що його навряд чи оберуть.
6278977	ukr	Том знав, що Мері навряд чи зайнята.
6278978	ukr	Том знав, що може трапитися щось погане.
6278979	ukr	Том знав, що може статися щось погане.
6278980	ukr	Том — герой Мері.
6278981	ukr	Том знав, що Мері буде в офісі.
6278982	ukr	Том все ще злиться?
6278983	ukr	Том добре вміє тримати речі на голові.
6278984	ukr	Том лише готується це зробити.
6278985	ukr	У Тома серйозні психологічні проблеми.
6278986	ukr	Том отримав багато листів від Мері.
6278987	ukr	Кого відвідав Том?
6278988	ukr	У кого був Том?
6278989	ukr	У Тома нещодавно було кілька поганих рішень.
6278990	ukr	Том нещодавно прийняв кілька поганих рішень.
6278991	ukr	Том весь рано грає на гітарі.
6278992	ukr	Тома не було у ліжку.
6278993	ukr	Том допомагає Мері зробити домашню роботу.
6278994	ukr	Том гадки не мав, що він занадто пронозливий.
6278995	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як і Мері.
6278996	ukr	Том робить це точно так само, як Мері.
6278997	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він мав зробити.
6278998	ukr	У Тома було багато часу зробити те, що він повинен зробити.
6278999	ukr	Том віддав грабіжникав усе, що вони хотіли.
6279000	ukr	Том поцілував Мері та вийшов з машини.
6279001	ukr	Том дізнався, що Мері заміжня.
6279002	ukr	Том не знає, як вибачитися французькою.
6279003	ukr	Том не знає, як вибачатися французькою.
6279004	ukr	Ось ці належать Тому.
6279005	ukr	Вони належать Тому.
6279006	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб його бачили з Мері.
6279007	ukr	Все, що хотів Том, — трохи вільного часу.
6279008	ukr	Том ще не знав, що робитиме.
6279009	ukr	Кожного дня Том відвозить дітей до школи.
6279010	ukr	У Тома було набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279011	ukr	У Тома набагато більше грошей, ніж у Мері.
6279012	ukr	Том одягнув окуляри.
6279013	ukr	Дмаю, Том зробить це знову.
6279014	ukr	Коли Том приїхав, поліція була вже на місці.
6279015	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том зробив це правильно.
6279016	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону зробити це.
6279017	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти Джону це зробити.
6279018	ukr	Том та Мері не змогли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279019	ukr	Том та Мері не могли допомогти мені зробити це.
6279020	ukr	Я туди не піду.
6279021	ukr	Том не злитиметься, якщо Мері це зробить.
6279022	ukr	Том не планує насправді цього робити, чи не так?
6279023	ukr	Том же не планує насправді цього робити?
6279024	ukr	Я тут не лишуся.
6279025	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, буде готувати йому вечерю?
6279026	ukr	Том не єдиний тут, хто може це зробити.
6279027	ukr	Гадаєш, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279028	ukr	Ви думаєте, Том буде тут сьогодні вдень?
6279029	ukr	Том примусив мене поклястися, що я ніколи більше цього не робитиму.
6279030	ukr	Кого ти відвідав?
6279031	ukr	У кого ти був?
6279032	ukr	Том зрозумів, що йому вже не потрібно це робити.
6279033	ukr	Гадаю, мені не варто було говорити Тому про це.
6279034	ukr	Чому ти голий?
6279035	ukr	Чому ти гола?
6279036	ukr	Том сказав, що він би не хотів робити це один.
6279037	ukr	Думаю, Том набагато краще від тебе плаває.
6279038	ukr	Гадаю, Том набагато краще від вас плаває.
6279039	ukr	Том каже, що зробить це, якщо цього захоче Мері.
6279040	ukr	Я думав, ще може бути зарано, щоб зайти до Тома.
6279041	ukr	Я живу у гуртожитку.
6279042	ukr	Том думає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не зробить.
6279043	ukr	Том гадає, що Мері, мабуть, ніколи цього не робитиме.
6279044	ukr	Я думав, що Ти знаєш, що Том та Мері одружені.
6279045	ukr	Том спробував зробити це, але не зміг.
6279046	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не попросить мене йому допомагати.
6279047	ukr	Том зробить це першим ділом вранці.
6279048	ukr	Мері була першою дівчиною, яку Том коли-небудь кохав.
6279049	ukr	Том зробить це для тебе, якщо захочеш.
6279050	ukr	Том зробить це для вас, якщо захочете.
6279051	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуй умовити Тома приєднатися до нашої команди.
6279052	ukr	Будь ласка, спробуйте умовити Тома вступити до нашої команди.
6279053	ukr	Я зробив тобі чаю.
6279054	ukr	Я зробила вам чаю.
6279055	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ви цього не зробите сьогодні.
6279056	ukr	Том буде розлючений, якщо ти цього не зробиш сьогодні.
6279057	ukr	Том та Мері сперечаються весь день.
6279058	ukr	Чому ти думаєш, що Том це коли-небудь робитиме?
6279059	ukr	Я сьогодні багато працював.
6279060	ukr	Том та Мері говорили про всяке-різне.
6279061	ukr	Чому Том зробив це — поза моїм розумінням.
6279062	ukr	Том та Мері колись співали разом у клубі.
6279063	ukr	Чому Тому потрібна Мері, щоб зробити це для нього?
6279064	ukr	Том спалив усі листи, які надіслала йому Мері.
6279065	ukr	Я маю йти додому.
6279066	ukr	Мушу вже йти додому.
6279067	ukr	Чому б Том робив це, якщо він не має цього робити?
6279068	ukr	Ти не міг би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279069	ukr	Ви не могли би бути настільки люб'язним, щоб зробити це для Тома?
6279070	ukr	Том не знав, що Мері гадає, що йому треба піти.
6279071	ukr	Ти б знав, якби Тому можна було це зробити?
6279072	ukr	Ти б знала, якби Тому можна було це робити?
6279073	ukr	Ми балакали годинами.
6279074	ukr	Ми говорили годинами.
6279075	ukr	Думаєш, Том не заперечував би проти того, щоб Мері це зробила?
6279076	ukr	Том забув купити те, про що його попросила Мері.
6279077	ukr	Ти мене пробачиш?
6279078	ukr	Ви мене пробачите?
6279079	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том коли-небудь почне це робити.
6279080	ukr	Том не повернеться, щоб забрати Мері.
6279081	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ти це зробив.
6279082	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том заперечував би, якби ви це зробили.
6279083	ukr	Сподіваюся, ми не програємо.
6279084	ukr	Том знав, що не дуже подобається Мері.
6279085	ukr	Думаю, Том, можливо, не зможе цього сьогодні зробити.
6279086	ukr	Том знав, що Мері не хоче пити пиво.
6279087	ukr	Том знав, що Мері, скоріш за все, не зайнята.
6279088	ukr	Я зробив добрий вибір.
6279089	ukr	Я зробила добрий вибір.
6279090	ukr	Я сподівався, що Том не скаже мені це робити.
6279091	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що потрібно зробити.
6279092	ukr	Том все ще не знає, що треба зробити.
6279093	ukr	Цікаво, коли Том показав Мері, як це робиться?
6279094	ukr	Том запросив Мері у найдорожчий ресторан у місті.
6279095	ukr	Тобі не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279096	ukr	Вам не потрібно оцифровувати все, Томе.
6279097	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені потрібно це зробити.
6279098	ukr	Це Том сказав мені, де живе Мері.
6279099	ukr	У тебе гарний дім.
6279100	ukr	У тебе гарна оселя.
6279101	ukr	Цікаво, чому Том сказав мені, що мені не треба цього робити.
6279102	ukr	Том не зміг зробити того, про що ми його попросили.
6279103	ukr	Я не певен, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279104	ukr	Я не певна, зробить це Том чи ні.
6279105	ukr	Том був дуже знервований, коли це відбувалося.
6279106	ukr	Мене не дивує, що Том хотів це зробити.
6279107	ukr	Мене не дивує, що Том хотів цим зайнятися.
6279108	ukr	У мене було погане відчуття щодо цього.
6279109	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері пішли на пляж.
6279110	ukr	На минулих вихідних Том з Мері ходили на пляж.
6279111	ukr	Я певен, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279112	ukr	Я певна, що Том зробив це навмисно.
6279113	ukr	Шкода, що Тома немає тут, щоб показати нам, що робити.
6279114	ukr	Том сказав, що він хоче бути там о котрій годині?
6279115	ukr	Тост виглядає так, ніби згорів.
6279116	ukr	Грінка виглядає ніби згоріла.
6279117	ukr	Можливо, тобі не варто це більше робити з Томом.
6279118	ukr	Коли я розповів про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279119	ukr	Коли я розповіла про це Тому, він нічого не сказав.
6279120	ukr	Том та Мері завжди робили це разом.
6279122	ukr	Де ваша парасолька?
6279123	ukr	Хто, на думку Тома, позичить йому парасольку?
6279124	ukr	Том не хотів, щоб хто-небудь бачив, як він це робить.
6279125	ukr	Хто дозволив Тому взяти мій велосипед?
6279126	ukr	Том робить це так, як його навчила Мері.
6279127	ukr	Я не розумів, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279128	ukr	Я не усвідомлювала, що Том одружений з Мері.
6279129	ukr	У тебе гарний будинок.
6279130	ukr	У вас гарний будинок.
6279131	ukr	Том чув, що Мері сказала, що не може цього зробити.
6279132	ukr	Я не думаю, що Том бажав би нам допомогти.
6279133	ukr	Том проінформував Мері, що вона не має цього робити.
6279134	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купив.
6279135	ukr	Сподіваюся, Тому сподобається подарунок, який я йому купила.
6279136	ukr	Том спробує знайти спосіб, як це зробити.
6279137	ukr	Думаю, тобі треба написати Тому лист-подяку.
6279138	ukr	Том знав, що Мері більше не мусить робити цього.
6279139	ukr	Я думав, що ти знаєш, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279140	ukr	Я думала, що ви знаєте, що Том закінчив Гарвард.
6279141	ukr	Том взяв три книжки в бібліотеці.
6279142	ukr	Том чув, як Мері та Джон розмовляли про Еліс.
6279143	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс полюбляють танцювати.
6279144	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс люблять танці.
6279145	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс — канадійці.

6279147	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс прийшли сюди разом.
6279148	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс приїхали сюди разом.
6279149	ukr	Том, Мері, Джон та Еліс з Бостона.
6279150	ukr	Том та Джон одружені на сестрах.
6279151	ukr	Том сидить між Мері та Джоном.
6279152	ukr	Я думаю, Том попросить Мері зробити це для Джона.
6279153	ukr	Том не хоче, щоб Мері казала Джону будь-що.
6279154	ukr	Хто сказав Тому попросити Мері допомогти Джону зробити це?
6279155	ukr	Тобі слід зробити те, що ти можеш.
6279156	ukr	Вам слід зробити те, що ви можете.
6279157	ukr	Мені подобається гаряча кава.
6279158	ukr	Я люблю гарячу каву.
6279159	ukr	Це нелегко зробити.
6279160	ukr	Це було нелегко зробити.
6279161	ukr	Це було не дуже важко зробити.
6279162	ukr	Переконати Тома зробити це було неважко.
6279163	ukr	Переконати Тома зробити це було нескладно.
6279164	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було неважко це зробити.
6279165	ukr	Я знаю, що Тому було нескладно це зробити.
6279166	ukr	Тома несправедливо звинуватили у злочині.
6279170	ukr	Туман розсіюється.
6279171	ukr	Тобі дійсно потрібно це зробити зараз.
6279172	ukr	Тобі дійсно зараз треба це зробити.
6279173	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно стільців.
6279174	ukr	Стільці більше не потрібні.
6279175	ukr	Якщо хочеш зробити це, зроби це.
6279176	ukr	Якщо хочете зробити це, зробіть це.
6279177	ukr	Тобі буде потрібно знову це зробити.
6279178	ukr	Вам буде потрібно зробити це знову.
6279179	ukr	Тобі слід це робити зараз.

6279186	ukr	Вам слід зробити це швидко.
6279187	ukr	Нам більше не потрібно часу.
6279188	ukr	Це не мало багато сенсу.
6279189	ukr	Мені дійсно слід це зараз зробити.
6279190	ukr	Я знав, що ти цього не робитимеш.
6279191	ukr	Я знала, що ви цього не робитимете.
6279192	ukr	Я мав право це сказати.
6279193	ukr	Я мала право це сказати.
6279194	ukr	Том та Мері чекають на друг дитину.
6279195	ukr	Копати — важка праця.
6279196	ukr	Том хоче піти стопами свого батька.
6279200	ukr	Ти маєш це зробити.
6279201	ukr	Тобі слід бути в своїй кімнаті.
6279202	ukr	Вам слід бути в своїй кімнаті.
6279203	ukr	Будь ласка, ніколи не лишай мене.
6279205	ukr	Я придумаю, як це зробити.

6279213	ukr	Тобі слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279214	ukr	Вам слід це зробити сьогодні.
6279511	ukr	Я боявся, що загублю тебе.
6279512	ukr	Я боялася, що загублю вас.
6279513	ukr	Мені слід зараз бути в Бостоні.
6279514	ukr	Мені дійсно зараз треба бути у ліжку.
6279516	ukr	Не пийте забагато вина.
6279518	ukr	Будь ласка, не будь такою галасливою.
6279523	ukr	Ці діти ваші?
6279524	ukr	Тобі слід було це зробити.
6279525	ukr	Вам слід було це зробити.
6279526	ukr	Мені насправді потрібно це зробити.
6279527	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже втомленим.
6279528	ukr	Я не почуваюся дуже втомленою.
6279529	ukr	Ці олівці твої?
6279530	ukr	Ці олівці ваші?
6279531	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це зараз.

6279535	ukr	Ці собаки твої?
6279536	ukr	Ці собаки ваші?
6279537	ukr	Тобі слід зробити це.
6279538	ukr	Вам слід зробити це.
6279539	ukr	Віддай мені усе.
6279540	ukr	Віддайте мені усу.
6279541	ukr	Цей собака ваш?
6279542	ukr	Цей собака твій?
6279543	ukr	Мені слід зробити це.
6279544	ukr	Хто нас врятує?
6279546	ukr	Дивись уважно, як я це роблю.
6279547	ukr	Спостерігайте уважно, як я це роблю.
6279548	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для тебе зробити.
6279549	ukr	Шкода, що я не можу це для вас зробити.
6279550	ukr	Ці яблука не були занадто дорогі.
6279551	ukr	Я думаю, ти теж можеш це зробити.
6279552	ukr	Я думаю, ви теж можете це зробити.
6279553	ukr	Учора Мері загубила свою сумочку.
6279554	ukr	Пропоную тобі зробити це зараз.
6279555	ukr	Пропоную вам зробити це зараз.
6279556	ukr	Давай заспіваєймо щось разом.
6279557	ukr	Заспіваймо щось разом.
6279558	ukr	Я все ще не отримаю задоволення від того, що роблю це.
6279559	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з тобою.
6279560	ukr	Я пам'ятаю, що робив це з вами.
6279561	ukr	Я пішов з Мері на танці.
6279562	ukr	Ми з Мері пішли на танці.
6279563	ukr	Ти колись намагався це робити?
6279564	ukr	Ви колись намагалися це робити?
6279565	ukr	Ніхто не викликався добровольцем, щоб зробити це.
6279566	ukr	Я вирішив знову це зробити.
6279567	ukr	Я вирішила зробити це знову.
6279568	ukr	Ми не звиклі до такого гамору.
6279569	ukr	Я однозначно зроблю це сьогодні.
6279570	ukr	Ми готуємося піти.
6279571	ukr	Я би на твоєму місці зробив це.
6279572	ukr	Я би на вашому місці зробив це.
6279573	ukr	Покажи мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279574	ukr	Покажіть мені якісь фотографії, будь ласка.
6279575	ukr	Я все ще не хочу цього робити.
6279576	ukr	Мені подобається колір твоєї машини.
6279577	ukr	Мені подобається колір вашої машини.
6279578	ukr	Мені все ще не подобається це робити.
6279579	ukr	Сподіваюся, екзамен буде легкий.
6279580	ukr	Я купив нову пару взуття.
6279581	ukr	Я купив нове взуття.
6279582	ukr	Я не хочу сьогодні це робити.
6279583	ukr	Мені здається, тобі треба піти.
6279584	ukr	Мені здається, вам треба піти.
6279585	ukr	Ти прочитав усю книжку?
6279586	ukr	Ти прочитала усю книжку?
6279587	ukr	Ти все ще можеш це зробити?
6279588	ukr	Ви все ще можете це зробити?
6279589	ukr	Хіба не ти тут головний?
6279590	ukr	Хіба не ви тут головна?
6279591	ukr	Де тобі потрібно це зробити?
6279592	ukr	Де вам потрібно це зробити?
6279593	ukr	Де ти маєш це зробити?
6279594	ukr	Де ви маєте це зробити?
6279595	ukr	Ці яблука були дорогі.
6279596	ukr	Ми не звиклі до того, щоб це робити.
6279597	ukr	Думаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279598	ukr	Гадаю, завтра дощитиме.
6279599	ukr	Ніхто не допоміг би мені це зробити.
6279600	ukr	Мені насправді сподобалося тут бути.
6279601	ukr	Я закікавлений у тому, щоб це зробити.
6279602	ukr	Сподіваюся, я здам екзамен.
6279603	ukr	Я готуюся зробити це.
6279604	ukr	Шкода, що я більше не можу робити цього.
6279605	ukr	Хіба ти не хочеш зробити паузу?
6279606	ukr	Я не поспішав це зробити.
6279607	ukr	Хто для нас готуватиме?
6279608	ukr	Думаю, нам не слід цього робити.
6279609	ukr	Я все ще шкодую, що не можу цього зробити.
6279610	ukr	Давай зіграємо партію у шахи.
6279611	ukr	Я колись мріяв про те, щоб зробити це.
6279612	ukr	Я колись мріяла про те, щоб зробити це.
6279613	ukr	Вже світлішає.
6279614	ukr	Я не знаю, хто може це зробити.
6279615	ukr	Я не міг утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279616	ukr	Я не могла утриматися від того, щоб зробити це.
6279617	ukr	Я отримав багато задоволення від фільму.
6279618	ukr	Я отримала багато задоволення від фільму.
6279619	ukr	Я не думаю, що нам це потрібно.
6279620	ukr	Де нам потрібно це зробити?
6279621	ukr	Я тобі щось купив.
6279622	ukr	Я вам щось купила.
6279623	ukr	Де ми маємо це зробити?
6279624	ukr	Все ці олівці мої.
6279625	ukr	Коли нам потрібно це зробити?
6279626	ukr	Коли ти маєш це зробити?
6279627	ukr	Коли ви маєте це зробити?
6279628	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ти це зробив.
6279629	ukr	Мені б хотілося, щоб ви це зробили.
6279630	ukr	Мері хотіла бути медсестрою.
6279631	ukr	Я б хотів, щоб я також це міг зробити.
6279632	ukr	Я б хотіла, щоб я також це могла зробити.
6279633	ukr	Вже темнішає.
6279634	ukr	Думаю, я це раз зробив.
6279635	ukr	Гадаю, я одного разу це зробила.
6279636	ukr	Я отримую багато задоволення, коли це роблю.
6279637	ukr	Всі відмовилися робити це.
6279638	ukr	Мені дуже сподобалося бути тут.
6279639	ukr	З ким нам слід це зробити?
6279640	ukr	Скільки заробляють учителі?
6279641	ukr	Скільки заробляють викладачі?
6279642	ukr	З ким ти міг би це зробити?
6279643	ukr	З ким ти могла би це зробити?
6279644	ukr	Коли ми маємо це зробити?
6279645	ukr	Ти тут головний?
6279646	ukr	Ви тут головна?
6279647	ukr	Я не звик до того, щоб це робити.
6279648	ukr	Я не звикла до того, щоб це робити.
6279649	ukr	Всі ці речі мої.
6279650	ukr	Я більше ніколи не робитиму.
6279651	ukr	Що ти робитимеш пізніше?
6279652	ukr	Що ви робитимите пізніше?
6279653	ukr	Я все ще сподіваюся, що зможу це зробити.
6279654	ukr	Прошу закрити вікна.
6279655	ukr	Закрийте вікна, будь ласка.
6279656	ukr	Обіцяю тобі, що я це зроблю.
6279657	ukr	Обіцяю вам, що зроблю це.
6279658	ukr	Я не буду більше намагатися.
6279659	ukr	Сподіваюся, я все ще можу це зробити.
6279660	ukr	Сподіваюся, я все ще вмію це робити.
6279661	ukr	Хіба ти ніколи цього не робив?
6279662	ukr	Хіба ви ніколи цього не робили?
6279663	ukr	Чому ми також не можемо цього зробити?
6279664	ukr	З ким ми могли б зробити це?
6279665	ukr	Хіба ти не голосуватимеш?
6279666	ukr	Хіба ви не будете голосувати?
6279667	ukr	Можливо, я зможу це зробити сьогодні.
6279668	ukr	Думаю, нам слід це зробити.
6279669	ukr	Ці яблука були дешеві.
6279670	ukr	Думаю, ти можеш це зробити.
6279671	ukr	Думаю, ви можете це зробити.
6279672	ukr	Я знаю, що ти цього не робив.
6279673	ukr	Я знаю, що ти цього не робила.
6279674	ukr	Хто нам допоможе?
6279675	ukr	А хто допоможе нам?
6279676	ukr	Я тобі не допомагатиму це робити.
6279677	ukr	Я вам не допомагатиму це робити.
6279678	ukr	Де нам треба робити це?
6279679	ukr	Де ти міг би це зробити?
6279680	ukr	Де ти могла би це зробити?
6279681	ukr	Що у тебе в шафі?
6279682	ukr	Що у вас в шафі?
6279683	ukr	Думаю, я зробив це одного разу.
6279684	ukr	Гадаю, я зробила це одного разу.
6279685	ukr	Ми все ще у небезпеці.
6279687	ukr	Сонце вже встало.
6279688	ukr	Мені все ще подобається це робити.
6279689	ukr	Твої черевики брудні.
6279690	ukr	У вас брудні черевики.
6279691	ukr	Я все ще сподіваюся це зробити.
6279692	ukr	Ми все ще спантеличені.
6279693	ukr	Де ми могли би це зробити?
6279694	ukr	Коли ти міг би це зробити?
6279695	ukr	Коли ти могла би це зробити?
6279696	ukr	Ти можеш скористатися моїм столом.
6279697	ukr	Ви можете скористатися моїм письмовим столом.
6279698	ukr	Ти любиш моркву?
6279699	ukr	Ви любите моркву?
6279700	ukr	Ти можеш скористатися моєю ручкою.
6279701	ukr	Ви можете скористатися моєю ручкою.
6279702	ukr	Я можу це для тебе зробити?
6279703	ukr	Я можу це зробити для вас?
6279704	ukr	Хто розбив тарілку?
6279705	ukr	Коли я міг би зробити це?
6279706	ukr	Коли я могла би зробити це?
6279707	ukr	Давай поміняємося місцями.
6279708	ukr	Давайте поміняємося місцями.
6279709	ukr	Як би ми могли це зробити?
6279710	ukr	Як би нам це зробити?
6279711	ukr	Ми можемо це зробити зараз?
6279712	ukr	Можна нам це зараз зробити?
6279713	ukr	Я купив новий капелюх.
6279714	ukr	Я купила новий капелюшок.
6279715	ukr	Можна мені це зробити зараз?
6279716	ukr	Я б хотів це якось зробити.
6279717	ukr	Я б хотіла це якось зробити.
6279718	ukr	Я хочу це якось зробити.
6279719	ukr	Я хочу це зробити у найближчому майбутньому.
6279720	ukr	Я хочу це зробити сьогодні ввечері.
6279721	ukr	Це леопард?
6279722	ukr	Ми не могли б їхати швидше? Я запізнююся.
6279723	ukr	Ми не могли би йти швидше? Я спізнююся.
6279724	ukr	Де я можу знайти таксі?
6279725	ukr	Де можна знайти таксі?
6279726	ukr	Вони влаштували нам засідку.
6279727	ukr	Я знову не спав всю ніч.
6279728	ukr	Я знову не спала всю ніч.
6279729	ukr	Це просто неможливо зробити.
6279730	ukr	Як сумно це казати.
6279731	ukr	Це було трохи незручно.
6279732	ukr	Том був надворі з друзями.
6279733	ukr	Том був не вдома з друзями.
6279734	ukr	Це погана гра слів.
6279735	ukr	Це несмішна гра слів.
6279736	ukr	Я пішов пішки до центру міста.
6279737	ukr	Це було просто зробити.
6279738	ukr	Зробити це було легко.
6279739	ukr	Це було складно зробити.
6279740	ukr	Зробити це було складно.
6279741	ukr	Думаю, нам це потрібно.
6279742	ukr	Це було виснажливо.
6279744	ukr	Це дуже поганий жарт.
6279745	ukr	Це дуже погана гра слів.
6279746	ukr	Це мене дуже непокоїть.
6279747	ukr	Це мене дуже турбує.
6279748	ukr	Чого ти боїшся найбільше?
6279749	ukr	Чого ви боїтеся найбільше?
6279750	ukr	Тут дуже галасливо.
6279751	ukr	Тут дуже тихо.
6279752	ukr	Думаю, ми всі втомилися.
6279753	ukr	Гадаю, ми всі втомилися.
6279754	ukr	Думаю, тобі треба йти.
6279755	ukr	Думаю, вам треба йти.
6279756	ukr	Я намагався саме це зробити.
6279757	ukr	Я ціную твою дружбу.
6279758	ukr	Я ціную вашу дружбу.
6279759	ukr	Я щойно збирався їсти.
6279760	ukr	Я щойно збиралася їсти.
6279761	ukr	Шкода, що й одружений.
6279763	ukr	Я ніколи не бачив моря.
6279764	ukr	Я ніколи не бачила моря.
6279765	ukr	О котрій годині перерва?
6279766	ukr	О котрій годині ми закінчуємо працювати?
6279767	ukr	О котрій годині ми починаємо працювати?

6285311	eng	The distant worlds observed by Hubble and other telescopes are just the tip of the iceberg, according to a Hubble survey of the center of our Milky Way. The study revealed that our galaxy should be brimming with 100 billion planets, at least one planet for every star.
6285312	eng	NASA's New Horizons mission, for example, was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto in the outer solar system. The spacecraft’s images of Pluto show a surprisingly complex world with giant ice mountains that had never been seen before.

6287099	eng	Let's begin with capitalism, a word that has gone largely out of fashion. The approved reference now is to the market system. This shift minimizes — indeed, deletes — the role of wealth in the economic and social system. And it sheds the adverse connotation going back to Marx. Instead of the owners of capital or their attendants in control, we have the admirably impersonal role of market forces. It would be hard to think of a change in terminology more in the interest of those to whom money accords power.

6287109	eng	Despite a flattering supposition to the contrary, people come readily to terms with power. There is little reason to think that the power of the great bankers, while they were assumed to have it, was much resented. But as the ghosts of numerous tyrants, from Julius Caesar to Benito Mussolini will testify, people are very hard on those who, having had power, lose it or are destroyed. Then anger at past arrogance is joined with contempt for the present weakness. The victim or his corpse is made to suffer all available indignities.

6293925	eng	Some of our solar-system neighbors have rain, too, but it is not made up of water, as it is on Earth.
6293926	eng	Venus has continuous showers of sulfuric acid rain. However, the acid rain evaporates before it reaches Venus's surface because of the planet's super-hot temperatures.

6293953	rus	Я отремонтировал свой компьютер.
6293954	eng	Pluto, located on the outskirts of our solar system, has a different kind of mountain range, made up of ice. The ice mountains are about 11,000 feet tall. The New Horizons spacecraft spotted them for the first time when it flew by the dwarf planet in July 2015.
6293955	eng	Scientists are still making new discoveries in our solar system.
6293956	eng	The Grand Canyon, located in the northwest corner of Arizona, was carved out millions of years ago by water.
6293957	eng	The Grand Canyon is one mile deep and about 100 miles long.
6293958	eng	The deepest canyon in the world is the Tsangpo Canyon, along the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet. The canyon is almost 3.5 miles deep and is slightly longer than the Grand Canyon.
6293959	eng	The Valles Marineris canyon on Mars is even deeper and much longer than Tsangpo Canyon, measuring 10 miles deep and stretching about 3,000 miles across, which is about the width of the continental U.S.
6293960	eng	History has recorded many violent volcanic eruptions on Earth.
6293961	eng	In 1991, Mt. Pinatubo's volcanic outburst in the Philippines produced the second largest eruption of the 20th century. Ash from the blast was ejected as high as 21 miles above Earth. Particles from the eruption created a layer of sulfuric acid haze in Earth's atmosphere, dropping global temperatures by nearly 1 degree Fahrenheit between 1991 and 1993.
6293962	eng	Volcanoes on other solar system planets are much larger and much more active than those on Earth.
6293963	eng	Olympus Mons, an inactive volcano on Mars, spreads over an area as large as the state of Arizona.
6293964	rus	Ну не плачь.
6293965	rus	Ну не плачьте.
6293966	eng	Jupiter's moon, Io, has more than 400 active volcanoes, making it the most geologically active object in the solar system. Several volcanoes on Io produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that rise as high as 300 miles above its surface.
6293967	eng	Rivers are plentiful on Earth, and each river has a connection of streams that all flow into it. Some of Earth's solar-system neighbors show evidence that they once had similar river systems.
6293968	eng	Observations of Mars, Venus, and Titan reveal a series of thin channels that lead to larger channels. Although now dry, these channels could have once been river systems.
6293969	eng	Like Earth, Mars has both northern and southern polar ice caps.
6293970	eng	Earth's polar ice caps consist of water ice. Mars's polar caps, however, are a combination of water ice and carbon-dioxide ice.
6293971	eng	The Martian polar caps thaw in summer and freeze in winter, showing that our solar system's planets are dynamic and changing.
6293972	eng	Some of the moons in the outer solar system are completely covered in ice. They don't have just polar caps. They have ice shells.

6293977	rus	На этой кровати никто не спал.
6293978	eng	Beneath the icy crust of Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, lies a liquid ocean that may have more water than Earth contains.
6293979	eng	Images of Europa's surface show ice that has broken up into ice flows, suggesting that water beneath the surface is moving and cracking the ice.
6293980	eng	The ice on Europa is generally hundreds of miles thick.
6293981	eng	If you really want a place that harbors life, then Earth is it. Our planet is neither too hot nor too cold. It has fierce storms and winds, but not at the extremes seen elsewhere in the solar system.
6293982	eng	As scientists learn about our neighboring worlds, they realize how forbidding these places can be. They also document how wonderful our Earth is and how accommodating it is for life. Earth is our oasis in space.

6293989	eng	Haumea spins rapidly, turning once every four hours, and is believed to be composed mostly of rock with a thin, icy shell and a dark red spot.
6293990	eng	Astronomers think a collision with a larger body caused the dwarf planet to lose its surface ice, producing the rapid spin.
6293991	eng	Haumea is named for the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth. Haumea's moons are named for the goddess' two daughters.
6293992	eng	Makemake was discovered in March 2005 and is classified as a dwarf planet. Its color is reddish-brown, and it has no atmosphere.

It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.
