7212981	eng	I've been thinking about what might happen.
7212982	eng	Tom is coming for dinner, isn't he?
7212983	eng	I really should've stayed in Boston longer.
7212984	eng	Tom and his brothers grew up in the Boston area.
7212985	eng	Doing that may take longer than you expect.
7212986	eng	Tom is going to be in touch with us.
7212987	eng	"What's today's date?" "It's October 20th."
7212988	eng	Tom is coming right back, isn't he?
7212989	eng	I'm going to be doing that starting today.
7212990	eng	Tom and Mary have been together for thirty years.
7212991	eng	I wanted to stay in Boston with my family.
7212992	eng	Tom is going to be thirty this year.
7212993	eng	I put the milk back into the refrigerator.

7212995	eng	How many people are you expecting to come?
7212996	eng	Tom is coming to get you, isn't he?
7212997	eng	As I've just told you, I won't doing that.
7212998	eng	Tom will probably tell you exactly what happened.
7212999	eng	This is the kind of place I want to live.
7213000	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for Mary.
7213001	eng	They refused to let me into the building.
