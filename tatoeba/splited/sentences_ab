54737	eng	Anyone would find it hard to run on such a hot day.
54738	eng	This intense heat doesn't seem to bother you.
54739	eng	How am I to pay such a debt?
54740	eng	There is no going out on such a stormy day.
54742	eng	With it raining like this, we'll never be able to leave.
54743	eng	Death is preferable to such suffering.
54744	eng	This is the first time I've seen such a dreadful movie.

54761	eng	I've never eaten anything as delicious as this.
54762	eng	Have you ever listened to such a good music?
54763	eng	You had better not wander around here by yourself.

54779	eng	You may not believe this, but I don't drink at all.
54780	eng	This is the first time.
54781	eng	He must be stupid to believe such a thing.
54782	eng	Have you ever heard of such a thing?
54783	eng	He must be a fool to do such a thing.
54784	eng	It was foolish of him to do such a thing.
54785	eng	Will you give me your reasons for doing this?
54786	eng	Please accept what little comfort these words can give you.
54787	eng	You might not believe what I'm about to tell you, so don't be surprised.
54788	eng	Did you ever hear of such a thing?
54789	eng	You may depend on it not happening again.
54790	eng	This is totally unacceptable.

64217	eng	Please clear away the tea things.
64218	eng	The quality of tea is going down.
64219	eng	Which do you prefer, tea or coffee?
64220	eng	Which would you rather have, tea or coffee?
64221	eng	Which do you like better, tea or coffee?
64222	eng	Tea and coffee helps to start the day.
64223	eng	The tea is too strong. Add some water.
64224	eng	We've run out of tea.
64225	eng	I'd like a tea.
64227	eng	I'm ashamed to say that it's true.
64228	eng	I'm glad to meet you.
64229	eng	Do you know each other?
64230	eng	Please let us know.
64231	eng	I hope your birthday is full of song and good times all day long! Happy birthday!
64233	eng	Happy birthday to you!

64237	eng	How late are you open?
64238	eng	Your garden needs some attention.
64239	eng	How do you heat the house?
64240	eng	I suggest that your son come to our party.
64241	eng	Your dog is very big.
64242	eng	How is it going with your family?
64243	eng	What kinds of goods do you sell in your shop?
64244	eng	Your children look healthy.
64245	eng	Let me take you home.
64246	eng	I am surprised that your family has a Japanese car.
64247	eng	Do you let your children drink coffee?
64248	eng	A burglar broke into your house while you were away on vacation.
64249	eng	Please feel free to have a second helping.
64250	eng	Don't talk about it in my mother's presence.
64251	eng	Would you like to wait?
64252	eng	Please hang on. I'll put him on the phone.
64253	eng	You'll have to wait.
64254	eng	Thank you for your patience.

64256	eng	I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
64257	eng	Take care of yourself.
64261	eng	Did you get the package I sent you?
64262	eng	At the funeral, the widow looked very dignified, with her black suit, hat and gloves.
64263	eng	Will I do as your partner?
64264	eng	We look forward to your early reply.
64265	eng	You may use my bicycle such as it is.
64266	eng	My car, such as it is, is at your disposal.
64267	eng	You shall be my daughter's husband.
64268	eng	I don't mean to make you worry.
64269	eng	I will sue you.
64270	eng	Guys, what are you talking about? Are you gonna steal my date!?
64271	eng	I think you'll like it too.
64272	eng	You're really a number-one fool.
64273	eng	You had better take this medicine if you want to get well.
64274	eng	You are lying to me.
64275	eng	You wouldn't be so casual about it if you were directly involved.
64276	eng	It will take a long time to live down your disgrace.
64277	eng	You trust people too much.
64278	eng	You have only to sweep the floor.
64279	eng	He told me point-blank that I was fired.
64280	eng	Have you made up your mind to become a teacher?
64281	eng	You have a habit of exaggerating everything.
64283	eng	I brought you up under my personal care.
64285	eng	You are old enough to take care of yourself.
64288	eng	You've taken everything.
64289	eng	You always try to blame somebody else.
64290	eng	You are a goody-goody.
64291	eng	You did it all right.
64292	eng	You always sing.
64293	eng	Don't scatter your things about.
64294	eng	I sure rubbed your nose in shit.
64295	eng	Your beauty turns me pale.
64296	eng	He looks like your brother.
64298	eng	Leave it alone!
64299	eng	This is your responsibility. It's not the kind of thing you can laugh off.
64300	eng	She sets your world alight.
64302	eng	You are soul needs rescue.
64303	eng	Your soul has been condemned to hell.
64304	eng	Your soul needs rescue.
64305	eng	Your behavior brought disgrace on our family.
64306	eng	Your heart's beating, alive and beating.
64307	eng	You have caused me to lose my temper.
64308	eng	This is your fault.
64309	eng	You are two-faced.
64310	eng	I can wait for you.
64311	eng	I will make a new suit for you.
64312	eng	I'm quite out of patience with you.
64313	eng	You shall have my car.
64314	eng	I'm counting on you.
64315	eng	I'm no match for you.
64316	eng	Can't you hear the sound?
64317	eng	I know you don't care.
64318	eng	I've got no time to sit and talk.
64319	eng	I know you can make it better.
64320	eng	I know you can make it.
64321	eng	Where were you loafing?
64322	eng	It seems you and I are essential to this project. We'd better get along or it'll go badly.
64323	eng	You noisy children will be chucked off by the driver.
64324	eng	I saw the picture you took of that fish.
64325	eng	You just made me miss the perfect shot when you hollered.
64327	eng	If you act like a child, you will be treated as such.
64328	eng	That's my own affair.
64329	eng	You are wrong.
64330	eng	There's no need for you to butt in. Just let him do this on his own.
64331	eng	You talk so fast I can't understand a word you say.
64332	eng	You are drunk!
64333	eng	You're overworked.
64334	eng	You should go ahead and do it, just like you said you would.
64335	eng	You should have seen yourself, yawning all through the meeting.
64336	eng	Good-bye!
64337	eng	You're out of it.
64339	eng	It's in the overhead compartment.
64341	eng	We'll call you when your table is ready.
64343	eng	What are you planning to do for the New Year vacation?
64344	eng	I am greatly indebted to you for all you have done for me.
64345	eng	I really appreciate your kindness.
64346	eng	It has always been a pleasure to work with you.
64347	eng	There is nothing to be gained by flattery.
64348	eng	Complimenting is lying.
64349	eng	Beware of smooth talk.
64351	eng	Could you bring me some water?
64352	eng	Can I have some water, please?
64353	eng	Could I get some water, please?
64354	eng	May I have a glass of water?
64355	eng	Just water, please.
64356	eng	The rights you requested do not belong to us.
64357	eng	May I have the honor of asking you?
64358	eng	I'd like a doll, a new bicycle.....and peace on earth!
64359	eng	No gratuity accepted.
64360	eng	Thank you again for your good thoughts.
64361	eng	Thanks so much for your good thoughts.
64362	eng	I'm very grateful for your sympathy.
64363	eng	This way, please, mademoiselle.
64364	eng	What's your daughter's name?
64365	eng	Your daughter passed the examination, I hear.
64366	eng	I ask to see your daughter.
64367	eng	Would you like a ride?
64368	eng	It was kind of you to invite us.
64370	eng	Thank you very much for your invitation.
64373	eng	What size do you wear?
64375	eng	This accident has nothing to do with me, officer.
64376	eng	Here comes a copper!
64377	eng	I am pleased at your coming.
64378	eng	Let's have sushi.
64379	eng	You can't drive. You've been drinking.
64380	eng	It was gracious of you to accept.
64381	eng	Can I drink alcohol?
64382	eng	Let's have sake.
64383	eng	As he was drinking he got very merry and kept telling everybody just how much he hated hospitals.
64384	eng	No drinkers.
64385	eng	Liquor will have an effect on a person.
64386	eng	The minute I have something to drink, I turn bright red.
64387	eng	Do you drink alcohol?
64388	eng	Everybody has their favorite drink.
64389	eng	Drinking too much is bad for the health.
64390	eng	I can't help you. As a matter of fact, I'm very busy just now.
64391	eng	Shall I help you?
64392	eng	I am willing to help you.
64393	eng	I said, "Is there anything I can do?"
64394	eng	I asked you if you wanted some help.
64395	eng	Let me take care of that for you.
64396	eng	Let me help you.
64398	eng	The maid was dead tired of her household chores.
64400	eng	The maid immediately cleaned the dishes from the table.
64401	eng	The servants tried to carry out their master's order.
64402	eng	The maid made my bed.
64403	eng	It's very decent of you to help me.
64404	eng	I'd be very grateful if you'd help me.
64405	eng	Could you help me?
64406	eng	It's very kind of you to help me.
64407	eng	Thank you for your assistance.
64409	eng	May I use the bathroom?
64412	eng	Could you show me where the bathroom is?
64415	eng	May I trouble you to pass me the salt?
64416	eng	I'm sorry to bother you.
64418	eng	I'm at a complete loss!
64419	eng	Don't be too hard on me, please.
64420	eng	I am in receipt of your letter.
64421	eng	Thank you very much for your letter.
64422	eng	I hereby beg to acknowledge your letter.

64428	eng	Thank you for writing.
64429	eng	Thank you for your letter.
64432	eng	You're my good omen.
64433	eng	Thank you for your business.
64434	eng	Would you like me to order it?
64435	eng	A young person wants to see you.
64436	eng	I am sorry if I disturbed you.
64437	eng	I hope I'm not disturbing you.
64438	eng	Thank you very much for your hospitality.
64439	eng	I'm sorry to disturb you, but there's a phone call for you.
64440	eng	I'm sorry to bother you, but I would like to ask you a favor.
64441	eng	Stop putting on an act.
64442	eng	Do you like the theater?
64443	eng	Where is your cap?
64444	eng	The custom of bowing is peculiar to the islanders.
64445	eng	Do you have a few minutes to spare?
64446	eng	I am sorry to have taken up your valuable time.
64447	eng	Do you have the time?
64448	eng	Please come and see me if you have time.
64449	eng	Do you have some time?
64450	eng	Is it to go?
64451	eng	Have mercy on me and spare my life, please!
64452	eng	With reference to the invoice No.56789 which was due last month, we have not yet received your remittance.
64453	eng	How would you like to pay?
64454	eng	How would you like to pay for it?
64455	eng	We remind you that our terms are 60 days net.
64456	eng	May we therefore ask you for a two months' extension of credit?
64457	eng	Your payment is now two months overdue.
64458	eng	Bring your children with you.
64459	eng	I'm sure the children are getting big.
64461	eng	Is the kid still up?
64462	eng	You should build a fire under the kid.
64463	eng	How old are your children?
64465	eng	How are you and your wife doing, now that the birds have all flown the coop?
64466	eng	May his life be blessed with health and happiness all through.
64467	eng	Do you have any children?
64468	eng	Please let me pick up your sister at the station.
64469	eng	I feel very sorry for your sister.
64470	eng	Will you give my best regards to your sister?
64471	eng	Will you go out on an errand?
64472	eng	I regret to say I can't come.
64475	eng	How is your work getting along?
64476	eng	Please wash the dishes.
64477	eng	Would you put the dishes in the sink?
64478	eng	Eat everything on your plate, or you won't get any dessert.
64479	eng	You'd better eat everything that's on your plate.
64480	eng	I'd like to go to Takayama during festival time.
64481	eng	The date of the festival coincides with that of the exam.
64482	eng	I greatly appreciate your efforts during our festival.
64483	eng	Sending year-end gifts is one of the customs peculiar to Japan.
64486	eng	Do you want to sit down?
64487	eng	Pass the sugar, please.
64488	eng	I will help you if you are in trouble.
64489	eng	I'd be happy to help you if you're having trouble.
64491	eng	Behave yourself.
64492	eng	What language do you speak in your country?
64493	eng	Behave yourself, and you'll get something nice.
64494	eng	Where are your manners?
64495	eng	What about your manners!
64496	eng	Watch yourself.
64497	eng	I hope you'll be happy forever.
64498	eng	My clothes have an oily smell because I ate at an okonomiyaki place.
64499	eng	Add salt and pepper to taste.
64500	eng	You may call on me whenever you like.
64501	eng	Whatever you like.
64502	eng	Help yourself to whatever you like.
64503	eng	Please help yourself to any food you like.
64505	eng	Sit wherever you like.
64506	eng	Have a satsuma for dessert.
64507	eng	Well, do you like it?
64508	eng	OK, so that's it for me. Now I'll hand things over to the next speaker.
64509	eng	We solved the problem by mutual concessions.
64510	eng	The chemistry is right for us.
64511	eng	Don't you get on each other's nerves?
64512	eng	They are bitter enemies.
64513	eng	Let's try to understand one another.
64514	eng	There must be a better person for both of us.
64515	eng	Let's stop finding fault with each other.
64516	eng	Let's keep in touch with each other.
64518	eng	To understand each other is important.
64519	eng	Let's agree to share in the profits.
64520	eng	Can we effect a compromise?
64521	eng	So there's no love lost between them then?
64522	eng	It is our duty to help one another.
64523	eng	I don't like families that quarrel amongst themselves.
64525	eng	It seems we are in the same boat.
64526	eng	Find mutual interests, and you will get along with each other.
64527	eng	You called?
64528	eng	What's the name of the party you're calling?
64529	eng	I will bear your words in mind.
64530	eng	If you insist, I'll have another drink.
64531	eng	I will borrow it then, if you insist.
64533	eng	How have you been?
64534	eng	I hope this letter finds you well.
64535	eng	Good luck to you!
64536	eng	Thank you for coming.
64537	eng	It's so kind of you to come to see me off.
64538	eng	It's nice of you to see me off.
64539	eng	Good show!
64541	eng	I'm sure people ask you this question all the time, but it's all that comes to mind right now.
64542	eng	Here they come.
64543	eng	Do you want the doctors to use the machine to make your brother breathe?
64544	eng	Can your brother drive a car?
64545	eng	Compared with his brother, he is a poor athlete.
64546	eng	Your brother got married, didn't he?
64549	eng	He wants the money.
64550	eng	For people who dislike the idea of giving money, a gift certificate is a good idea.
64552	eng	I can't lend you any money.
64553	eng	I will do that work on condition that I get paid for it.
64554	eng	I caught a pickpocket dead to rights when he stole my money.
64555	eng	It is wrong to steal money.
64556	eng	My money was stolen.
64557	eng	I'm trying to save money.
64558	eng	Can you save enough money for the down payment?
64559	eng	I can't lend you money, because I don't have any myself.
64560	eng	Would you lend me some money?
64561	eng	All the money spent, we started looking for work.
64562	eng	All the money put together still won't be enough.
64563	eng	Should I insert coins first?
64564	eng	Will you lend me some money?
64567	eng	I have got some money.
64568	eng	Give me a little money.
64569	eng	We should not make too much of money.
64570	eng	It is against my principles to borrow money.
64571	eng	Is it possible to borrow money?
64572	eng	I ran all over town trying to borrow some money.
64573	eng	People with money were able to buy butter.
64574	eng	You may spend or save at will.
64575	eng	Spending money is as easy as pie.
64576	eng	I wish I had more money with me.
64577	eng	With all his money, he is not happy.
64578	eng	You had better not waste your money.
64579	eng	I have a lot of money.
64580	eng	Please leave some money.
64581	eng	If you have any money, please lend me some.
64582	eng	Can I borrow some money from you?
64583	eng	It goes without saying that health is above wealth.
64584	eng	I don't have much money, but I can get along somehow.
64585	eng	I'll give you back the money tomorrow.
64586	eng	Lend money only to such as will repay it.
64587	eng	Money is used for buying or selling goods, measuring value and storing wealth.
64588	eng	You should be careful of your money.
64589	eng	The money amounts to almost two thousands dollars.
64590	eng	You must make good use of money.
64591	eng	You cannot substitute money for health.
64592	eng	Money will do anything.
64593	eng	You should turn money to good use.
64595	eng	I have hardly any money left.
64596	eng	There was scarcely any money left.
64597	eng	How much money do you have?
64598	eng	I have little money. However, I feel happy with you.
64599	eng	Money answers all things.
64600	eng	I do not want any money.
64601	eng	How much money do you have with you?
64602	eng	I'm not worried about the price.
64603	eng	Money takes a long time to earn, but you can spend it in no time.
64604	eng	How would you like them?
64605	eng	Do you have much money with you?
64607	eng	If you have any money with you, please lend me some.
64608	eng	Do you have any money with you?
64609	fra	Maintenant qu'il est parti, il nous manque énormément.
64610	eng	She is exact in money matters.
64612	eng	Can you imagine the world without money?
64613	eng	Some people write books for money, others for pleasure.
64614	eng	If she continues to live with a man she doesn't love for his money, the day will come when she will be utterly frustrated and between the devil and the deep blue sea.
64615	eng	I'll try Jane for some money.
64616	eng	Stop arguing about money.
64617	eng	Money counts for little.
64618	eng	Money, as such, has no meaning.
64619	eng	Moving money and technology from one side of the globe to the other is not enough.
64620	eng	I want money.
64621	eng	Since we have no money, it's no use thinking of a holiday.
64622	eng	I'm too poor to buy a new suit.
64623	eng	If you need money, I'll lend you some.
64624	eng	Love is as important to me as money is to her.
64625	eng	Do you need much money?
64626	eng	Money has changed his life.
64627	eng	I am running short of money.
64628	eng	Lack of money brought my travel plans to an end.
64629	eng	I can't do it for want of money.
64630	eng	If I had enough money, I could buy this book.
64631	eng	It is generally believed that money brings happiness.
64633	eng	I have run short of money.
64634	eng	Our money ran out.
64636	eng	I can't buy it for lack for money.
64637	eng	We could not continue our journey for lack of money.
64639	eng	It goes without saying that money is not everything.
64640	eng	If you need some money, why don't you borrow some from your mother?
64642	eng	You can withdraw some money out of the bank, if you need any.
64643	eng	The idea that money can buy everything is wrong.
64644	eng	Had I had enough money, I would have bought that computer.
64645	eng	Now that I have enough money, I can get that camera.
64646	eng	I'm very happy to make your acquaintance.
64648	eng	I'm glad to know you.
64649	eng	If you are not in a hurry, please stay a little longer.
64650	eng	How about cup of tea or something, if you aren't in a hurry?
64651	eng	How was your holiday?
64652	eng	The holiday was up very quickly.
64653	eng	Good night and sweet dreams.
64654	eng	We have a parking lot for the customers.
64655	eng	You mustn't keep your guest waiting outside.
64656	eng	What about you? Will you have orange juice, too?
64657	eng	The visitor has gone away five minutes before you came back.
64658	eng	Have all the passengers got on board yet?
64659	eng	Our guests should be here within an hour.
64660	eng	What will you be having?
64661	eng	Is there a doctor in the house?
64662	eng	Earning our customers confidence and respect is this firm's objective.
64663	eng	Please write down your home address.
64664	eng	We are trying to clarify your future procurement requirements.
64665	eng	We aim to please.
64666	eng	Could I ask you to get a cup of tea for our guest?
64667	eng	Sir, you have left your lighter on the table.
64668	eng	We have to take great pains to make our guests feel comfortable.
64669	eng	Our guests have arrived.
64670	eng	I'm sorry, sir, but a jacket and tie are required.
64671	eng	The guests were waited on by a highly trained team of young staff.
64672	eng	The customers were made to wait outside in the rain for several hours.
64673	eng	We must keep the customers satisfied.

64704	eng	Come on! Give me a chance.
64705	eng	I'd like to ask a favor of you.
64706	eng	Could you do me a favor? Will you lend me some money?

64758	eng	Would you care for drinks?
64760	eng	Do you want something to drink?
64761	eng	I'd like to say yes, but...
64762	eng	Certainly. I'd be glad to.
64765	eng	Did you go to see a doctor?
64766	eng	The doctor told you to stay in bed until your fever goes down, didn't he?
64767	eng	My sides ache, doctor.
64769	eng	If you need to go off-line, that is fine.
64770	eng	It is a sad house where the hen crows louder than the cock.
64771	eng	It is the hen that makes the rooster crow.
64772	eng	I have something to live for in music.
64773	eng	Let's begin at the last line but one.
64774	eng	I'll peel an orange for you.
64775	eng	I begin to lose control of myself.
64776	eng	I prefer apples to oranges.

64778	eng	Oranges are sweeter than lemons.
64779	eng	Oranges have a high vitamin content.
64780	eng	It was so sour an orange that I could not eat it.
64781	eng	Oranges contain a lot of vitamin C.
64782	eng	The price of oranges has come down.
64783	eng	Oranges are rich in vitamin C.
64784	eng	A glass of orange juice refreshed me.
64785	eng	I'd like orange juice.
64786	eng	Two glasses of orange juice, please.
64788	eng	Orange juice, and two eggs over easy.
64789	eng	I want an orange juice or something.
64790	eng	"Orange Cards" are available from the conductor.

64795	eng	I don't see anything.
64797	eng	Am I not right?
64798	eng	Don't take it out on me.
64799	eng	I do not know the meaning of hatred.
64800	eng	We will go but you won't.
64801	eng	Mr. Brown, a friend from Oregon, will visit us tomorrow.

64818	eng	Olivier acted the part of Hamlet.

64827	eng	Go where you will in Holland, you will see windmills.
64828	eng	What's their approximate worth?
64829	eng	In about two weeks.
64830	eng	Have you finished it already?
64831	eng	My heavens, what an enormous box!

64856	eng	I hear you Irish are a bunch of drinkin' fools.
64857	eng	Ask the policeman the way.
64858	eng	The patrolman motioned me to pull over.
64859	eng	What is more, he has a strong will.
64860	eng	On top of that, it was raining.
64861	eng	Also, there is a greater risk of accidents.
64862	eng	It's high time you children went to bed.
64863	eng	You are under arrest.

64877	eng	You're fired.
64878	eng	You are too young to travel alone.
64882	eng	How lazy you are!
64883	eng	Now that you are no longer young, you must think of your future.
64884	eng	You are no longer a child.
64885	eng	How does it happen that you were not eaten up with all those hundreds and trillions of cats?
64887	eng	What are you eyeing?
64891	eng	Put your coat on my account.
64892	eng	It's to see your face well.
64893	eng	What is your riddle?
64894	eng	Ask her if she'll sew up the hole in your jeans.
64895	eng	The sight of you is an abomination to me.
64896	eng	I shouldn't have told you nothin'.
64897	eng	That is a fine fix you have got us into.
64898	eng	A boy your age ought to behave well.
64899	eng	It was careless of you to forget your homework.
64900	eng	Get back to where you started.
64901	eng	I know you're working part-time.

64938	eng	Grandmother looks very comfortable in that chair beside the fire.

64972	eng	He's not really your father. Heh-heh.
64974	eng	She and I have been married 30 years.
64975	eng	Don't pay any attention to what he says.
64976	eng	Dad! Mom! I have some great news for you!

64983	eng	Oops, my pen has run out of ink.
64984	eng	Look! We've missed the bus.
64985	eng	Wait until further notice.
64986	eng	What you said does not make sense.
64987	eng	Your meaning didn't come across clearly.
64988	eng	I really understand what you mean.
64989	eng	I think what you say is true.
64990	eng	Admitting what you say, I still think he's in the right.
64991	eng	I don't see your point.
64992	eng	I can't go along with what you said.
64993	eng	When did you graduate from Oxford?

65009	eng	Sorry to impose, but would you please open the window?
65010	eng	Excuse me but, would you kindly lift that box for me?
65011	eng	The chances are that she will win the game.
65012	eng	The chances are that she'll quit her job.

65014	eng	It is probable that she will win the speech contest.
65015	eng	It is probable that her first album will sell well.
65016	eng	Perhaps they can feel the lines with their bodies.
65017	eng	The chances are that he'll be beaten.
65018	eng	Ten to one he will succeed.
65019	eng	No doubt he will pass the examination.
65020	eng	The chances are he's already heard the news.
65021	eng	It is conceivable that he knows the rumor.
65022	eng	It is likely to be fine.
65023	eng	His team is likely to win.
65024	eng	Records are particularly scarce for this era, perhaps owing to a long series of natural disasters which befell the capital.
65025	eng	Politics is perhaps the only profession for which no preparation is thought necessary.
65026	eng	I am afraid it will rain in the afternoon.
65027	eng	In all likelihood, it will rain this afternoon.
65028	eng	Maybe you'll succeed.
65029	eng	He observed that it would probably rain.
65030	eng	In all likelihood, we shall be away for a few days.
65031	eng	I dare say it is a lie.
65032	eng	I think you've got the flu.
65033	eng	There is, perhaps, not one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as vanity.
65034	eng	Perhaps it is only in childhood that books have any deep influence on our lives.
65036	eng	To make an excuse for having stayed out late.
65037	eng	It's too late. I'll see you home.
65038	eng	What would you recommend we eat?

65047	eng	Cut the talking and listen.
65049	eng	Stop chattering and finish your work.
65050	eng	Cut the chit-chat and get to work.
65051	eng	A talkative person is always letting the cat out of the bag and jeopardizing the interests of others.
65052	eng	Let's attend to our work instead of talking.
65053	eng	I like him apart from the fact that he talks too much.
65054	eng	Let's quit and go home.

66791	eng	No, I'm afraid not.
66792	eng	No, you need not go right now.
66794	eng	No, I've never been there.
66795	eng	No, you don't.
66796	eng	No, you won't.
66797	eng	No, he will not.
66799	eng	No, I'm not singing.
66800	eng	No, I went out.
66801	eng	No, it gains ten minutes a day.
66802	eng	No, no, my dear.
66803	eng	No, he has gone out for lunch already.
66805	eng	No, I haven't written it yet.
66806	eng	No problem. Come again soon.
66807	eng	No, I will go by bus.
66808	eng	No, please dial nine first.
66809	eng	No, but I'll look it up in the dictionary.
66810	eng	No, but I play tennis.
66811	eng	No, I don't. But I have a slight cold.
66812	eng	No, but they might have them at our other store.
66813	eng	No, thank you. I'm just looking.
66814	eng	No, you don't have to.
66815	eng	No, no, it's on me.
66816	eng	No, I don't. I want a room for tonight.
66817	eng	No, thank you. I'm just looking around.
66818	eng	No, thank you. I've had enough.
66819	eng	No, not how many toys, how many keys?
66820	eng	No, not too much.
66821	eng	No, it's been delayed 45 minutes.
66822	eng	This is a great apartment.
66823	eng	I made Ann my secretary.
66824	eng	Ammonia is a colorless liquid or gas with a very strong smell.
66825	eng	They were treating me so rudely that I suddenly just lost it.
66826	eng	You shouldn't rely too heavily on the weather report.
66827	eng	Don't be so greedy.
66828	eng	I have neglected you so long that I feel a bit shy in visiting you.
66829	eng	Ann is exclusive in her choice of friends.
66830	eng	Anne is the envy of all her friends.
66831	eng	Ann does not lack for friends.
66832	eng	Ann sings elegantly.
66833	eng	Ann sang a lullaby for her little sister.
66834	eng	Ann has achieved her desired goal.
66835	eng	Ann seems to be ill.
66836	eng	Ann often plays tennis after school.

66840	eng	Ann is a little girl.
66841	eng	Ann has a kind heart.
66842	eng	Ann likes to write poems.
66843	eng	Anne will not come to our party.
66844	eng	Ann gave me this present.
66845	eng	Ann can't find a job.
66846	eng	Anne is patiently knitting.
66847	eng	Ann was in a hurry this morning.
66848	eng	Ann wrote something on the blackboard.
66849	eng	Ann came downstairs.
66850	eng	Ann must be dreaming a happy dream.
66851	eng	Anne will not accomplish anything.
66852	eng	Ann likes music very much.
66853	eng	Anne accepted Henry's proposal.
66854	eng	Ann will not come to our party.
66855	eng	Ann was long coming.
66856	eng	Ann gave an account of how she had escaped.
66857	eng	Ann plays tennis very well.
66858	eng	Ann has a weakness for chocolate.
66859	eng	Ann is a cheerleader.
66860	eng	Ann has just finished writing her report.
66861	eng	Ann bent her mind to the work.
66862	eng	Ann finished painting the picture.
66863	eng	Ann was surprised to hear the rumor.
66864	eng	Ann has a little money with her.
66865	eng	I think Ann loves Jack.
66866	eng	I wonder when Anne will come.
66867	eng	Ann always keeps her room clean.
66868	eng	It is said that Anne will get married in June.
66869	eng	Anne lived in terror of being captured by Nazis.
66870	eng	Which book did you pick out to send to Anne?

66872	eng	I must apologize to Ann.
66873	eng	Ann had no friends to play with.
66874	eng	Ann has no sister.
66875	eng	Anne has many admirers.
66876	eng	I can't abide to see such fellows.
66877	eng	It is unlikely that such a cool headed person got upset.
66878	eng	I cannot abide such people.
66879	eng	I wish I had not bought such a useless thing.
66880	eng	I'm sorry I was so rude.
66881	eng	What am I supposed to say when he puts it so logically?
66882	eng	You shouldn't have flown out like that.
66883	eng	He must be crazy to behave like that.
66884	eng	I don't talk to anyone who's that status-conscious.
66885	eng	Don't take any notice of those rude boys.
66886	eng	Those gloom and doom economists aren't worth their salt.
66887	eng	Getting shy Kyoko to talk at a party is like pulling teeth.
66888	eng	You needn't have helped him with his work.
66889	eng	Lending money to such a fellow is as good as throwing it away.
66890	eng	You're going to fall and sprain your ankle wearing sandals with such huge platforms.
66891	eng	I like the sound of what he says, but it IS just talk, you know.
66892	eng	I can't bear the sight of him.
66893	eng	Don't have anything to do with him. He is completely untrustworthy.
66894	eng	I did wrong in trusting such a fellow.
66895	eng	He should be put in prison.
66896	eng	He would sooner rather die than work for that man.
66897	eng	You are crazy to lend money to him.
66898	eng	Don't go down before such a man.
66900	eng	How did you come to know such a wonderful girl?
66901	eng	I can't hold with such a politician.
66902	eng	That politician put his foot in his mouth when he made those racist comments.
66903	eng	Don't associate with such people.
66904	eng	Don't get involved with those people.
66905	eng	There are few if any such kind men.
66906	eng	No one knows when such a custom first came into existence.
66907	eng	He cannot be a gentleman to say such a rude thing.
66908	eng	He's completely shunned. I'm surprised he's still working here.
66909	eng	He is fortunate having such a good wife.
66910	eng	Such behavior is beneath his dignity.
66911	eng	Never did I see such a fool.
66912	eng	I cannot shed a tear for that horrible man.
66913	eng	It was stupid of me to make such a mistake.
66914	eng	How foolish I was not to discover that simple lie!
66916	eng	You ought not to have kept her waiting on such a cold night.
66917	eng	He'll have an accident one of these days if he keeps driving like that.
66918	eng	I can beat him hands down.
66919	eng	If you trust such a fellow, you'll lose everything you have.
66920	eng	He must be a fool to talk like that.
66921	eng	Anna married without the knowledge of her parents.
66922	eng	I'll bet it gives her a feeling of superiority to be so beautiful.
66923	eng	It's unlike him to get so angry.
66924	eng	You need not have come so early in the morning.
66925	eng	With all her merits she was not proud.
66926	eng	Never have I seen such a big whale.
66927	eng	You must be a good athlete to have run a mile in such a short time.
66928	eng	I can't apply my mind to anything with all that noise!
66929	eng	Can he be ill when he runs around like that?
66930	eng	I've never heard English spoken so quickly.
66931	eng	It is fortunate that we should have met such kind people.
66932	eng	Liking children the way she does Sue should become a teacher.
66933	eng	I had never seen such an exciting baseball game before.
66934	eng	I wish I hadn't seen such a horrible film.
66935	eng	You are fortunate to have such loving parents.
66936	eng	I wish I hadn't spent so much money.
66937	eng	If I tried to wear shoes with heels that high, I'd sprain my ankle.
66938	eng	I wish I had not spent so much money.
66939	eng	Shame on you for getting so flustered. You looked ridiculous.
66940	eng	I'd love to be able to wear a dress like that. But I'll have to lose some weight first.
66941	eng	She was the last person I had expected to see there.
66942	eng	It's quite absurd of you to tell her that sort of thing.
66943	eng	It's the first time that anybody said something like that to me.
66944	eng	It is courageous of you to say such a thing.
66945	eng	You've got to be crazy to do something like that.
66946	eng	After what has happened, I dare not see her again.
66947	eng	You shouldn't have said such a thing to her.
66949	eng	How long are you going to be seeing that loser of a boyfriend?
66950	eng	It's hard to complain against such good people.
66951	eng	The number of errors of fact in Arendt's book are considerably fewer than Abel implies.
66952	eng	It seems Ann and Zachary ran off together.
66953	eng	Andersen was afraid of dogs, too.
66954	eng	I was looking for Andy. Do you know where he is?
66955	eng	Andy is never late for a date.
66956	eng	Andy must have practiced very hard.
66957	eng	Andy hung his shirt up in the closet.
66958	eng	Andy is master of French and German.
66959	eng	Oh, and Andy Dillon called...
66960	eng	You've got the wrong station.
66962	eng	What know you of patience?
66963	eng	You came when I was thirty.
66964	eng	You can't be hungry. You had a snack a few minutes ago.
66965	eng	You have a good camera.
66966	eng	If you dress like that at your age, you'll make a fool of yourself.
66967	eng	I am afraid your watch is two minutes slow.
66968	eng	Everybody except the Anderson family is going to the party next Thursday evening.
66969	eng	Why are you with a pig?
66970	eng	What are you lining up for?
66971	eng	Anthony was esteemed by the Egyptians.
66972	eng	The apricot trees are in full blossom.
66973	eng	Angola was once a Portuguese territory.
66974	eng	The questionnaires were distributed at random.
66975	eng	The questionnaire form was distributed properly.
66976	eng	I love Ann all the more because she is shy.
66977	eng	Ann cannot be playing the piano.
66978	eng	Is the rumor that Anne will get married to John true?
66979	eng	Either Ann or Carol is going to take care of the baby.
66980	eng	Huh? What is this? They're not going to use my proposal?
66981	eng	Being a hasty person, he is likely to jump to conclusions.
66982	eng	Being written in great haste, this letter has quite a few mistakes.
66984	eng	Marry in haste, and repent at leisure.
66985	eng	You should grab your bag and hurry home.
66986	eng	It's better to take your time at this job than to hurry and make mistakes.
66987	eng	Hasty marriage seldom succeeds.
66989	eng	What's that?
66990	eng	I have heard nothing from him since then.
66991	eng	Nothing can be worse than that.
66992	eng	I have had a series of misfortunes since then.
66993	eng	Will you introduce me to the young woman talking with Mrs. Allen?
66994	eng	Allen was given a problem that was impossible to solve.
66995	eng	Can I see that one?
66996	eng	Do you have any allergies?
66997	eng	I have allergic rhinitis.
66998	eng	Those are their books.
66999	eng	Whose books are those?
67000	eng	Those are our teachers' cars.
67001	eng	Those are my sister's books.
67002	eng	Those are my books.
67003	eng	Those are my CDs.
67004	eng	Those are our books.
67005	eng	Are those your pictures?
67006	eng	They move from place to place.
67007	eng	Those books are theirs.
67009	eng	Those cats are liked by her.
67010	eng	What do you think of those Japanese writers?
67011	eng	Those mechanics are paid as much as ten thousand yen per hour.
67012	eng	Those photos are hers.
67013	eng	Those houses are 500 years old.
67014	eng	Those flowers smell sweet.
67015	eng	Those houses are big.
67016	eng	Those houses are my uncle's.
67017	eng	The reputation of those musicians is not the best.
67018	eng	Those dark clouds will probably bring rain.
67019	eng	Those apples are big.
67020	eng	Those dogs are big.
67021	eng	His patience was worn out by all these troubles and anxieties.
67022	eng	That is not an orange, either.
67023	eng	The game would not have been called off if it hadn't rained so heavily.
67024	eng	For all the money he has, he is not happy.
67025	eng	For all his wealth, he is not happy.
67026	eng	For all his wealth and fame, he is unhappy.
67027	eng	For all his experience, he had no idea what to do with it.
67028	eng	That's the man who lives next door.
67029	eng	It was so hard, I tell you.
67030	eng	Is that a picture of me?
67031	eng	That is a student whom my father teaches.
67032	eng	That is her house.
67033	eng	That is the temple which they live in.
67034	eng	That is his house.
67035	eng	That is his car.
67036	eng	Those were his actual words.
67037	eng	That is the picture that he painted.
67038	eng	That is the house where he lives.
67039	eng	That is not a horse, but a donkey.
67040	eng	That is such a high mountain as old people can't climb.
67041	eng	Is that a cat or a dog?
67042	eng	That is a pagoda.
67043	eng	That's a farce.
67044	eng	Whose book is that?
67045	eng	Whose car is that?
67046	eng	Whose shoes are those?
67047	eng	I call that some poem.

67050	eng	One thing led to another.
67051	eng	That is the highest mountain in the world.
67052	eng	That is the fastest train in the world.
67053	eng	That is our school.
67054	eng	That is my sister's camera.
67055	eng	That is the building where my father works.
67056	eng	This is my dog.
67057	eng	That was my mistake.
67058	eng	That is not my pen.
67059	eng	That is my overcoat.
67060	eng	That's our house.
67061	eng	That is the restaurant where we had dinner yesterday.
67062	eng	That is the shop where I used to work.
67063	eng	That is the house where I was born.
67064	eng	That is the same bicycle as I have.
67065	eng	That is the same skirt as I bought yesterday.
67066	eng	That's the boy I saw yesterday.
67067	eng	That was the most interesting novel that I had ever read.
67068	eng	That is the man whom I know well.
67069	eng	That is the girl whom I know well.
67070	eng	That is the girl who waited on me in the shop yesterday.
67071	eng	That is a high building, is it not?
67072	eng	That is an old camera.
67073	eng	That is an old castle.
67074	eng	Isn't that your dictionary?
67075	eng	Those tears are artificial.
67076	eng	They are a good airline to fly with.
67077	eng	Is that a cow or a buffalo?
67078	eng	That was a valuable experience.
67079	eng	That is a leather belt.
67080	eng	That's a problem difficult to solve.
67081	eng	What does that sign say?
67082	eng	What's that bird?
67083	eng	What is the name of that river?
67085	eng	That is not a yellow piece of chalk.
67086	eng	That is a pencil.
67087	eng	Is that the man whose wife was killed in the car accident?
67088	eng	It's Mt. Rushmore.
67089	eng	It is out of fashion.
67090	eng	That can't be Mary. She is in hospital now.
67091	eng	Is that a bus or a car?
67092	eng	Is that a cat?
67093	eng	What a big ship that is!
67094	eng	That is not a tiger.
67095	eng	That is a very complex machine.
67096	eng	It was such a wonderful movie that I saw it five times.
67097	eng	That was not at all an appropriate remark.
67098	eng	That is a table.
67099	eng	That is just what I wanted.
67100	eng	Is that as heavy as this?
67101	eng	That is the boy who came here yesterday.
67102	eng	I bet he is our principal.
67103	eng	It's a pheasant.
67104	eng	That is a lovely doll, isn't it?
67105	eng	That is your book.
67106	eng	That is the bus stop.
67107	eng	Yeah, she must be the sure thing!
67108	eng	There is no more difficult task than that.
67109	eng	Can you tell me how this compares to that?
67110	eng	To teach Alex, Pepperberg used a special form of training.
67111	eng	How many cars does Alex have?
67112	eng	Alex is for the most part just an ordinary bird.
67113	eng	Alex will answer, "Color!"
67114	eng	Alex seemed to learn nouns such as "paper," "key" and "cork," and color names such as "red," "green" and "yellow."
67115	eng	"Five!" says Alex.
67116	eng	Alex would correctly describe the object and color, even if he had never seen that object before.
67117	eng	Alex names objects, like "walnut," "paper" and "corn".
67118	eng	That amount of food will last them for a week.
67119	eng	Ask Alex.
67120	eng	How long did it take you to collect so many coins?
67121	eng	You shouldn't even try making sense of it.
67122	eng	I have taken everything into consideration.
67123	eng	The worried housewife heard the telephone ring and quickly picked up the receiver.

67982	eng	The lady that is speaking to that boy is his teacher.
67983	eng	It is no use asking a favor of that man.
67984	eng	What he lacks is courage.
67985	eng	Watch out for that man.
67986	eng	I like that man all the better for his faults.
67987	eng	I cannot abide him.
67988	eng	I do not put my complete confidence in him.
67989	eng	He is not the only pebble on the beach.
67990	eng	Although I was angry at the man for his rudeness, I held my tongue.
67992	eng	If that man makes one more mistake, I'll fire him.
67993	eng	Was that word appropriate in that situation?
67994	eng	We cannot tell how much that great statesman has done for his country.
67995	eng	The tycoon endowed each son with a million dollars.
67996	eng	That university was my first choice.
67997	eng	That university conducts its entrance examinations using a computer scored answer sheet.
67998	eng	That big boy is bullying the little children.
67999	eng	I can't put up with that loud noise.
68000	eng	Look at the monkey on that bough.
68001	eng	Look at that big dog.
68002	eng	Look at that big hammer.
68003	eng	That big one is also mine.
68004	eng	That typhoon prevented me from going out.
68005	eng	I have to tell him off for his bad attitude.
68006	eng	I can not stand that noise.
68007	eng	I can't abide that noise.
68008	eng	I can't endure that noise a moment longer.
68009	eng	Would you be so kind as to shut that window?
68010	eng	Look at that boy running.
68011	eng	Don't use the desk by that window.
68012	eng	Those twins look like two peas in a pod.
68013	eng	Everyone is anxious to know what has become of the former champion.
68014	eng	The contestant made two false starts.
68015	eng	That ship goes abroad from this port.
68016	eng	He was living in England when the war broke out.
68017	eng	I often go fishing in the river.
68018	eng	That river is dangerous to swim in.
68019	eng	I think it's dangerous to swim in that river.
68020	eng	The executive director is a real pushover for looks.
68021	eng	The teacher handles his pupils well.
68022	eng	That fortune-teller is no better than a liar.
68023	eng	That Prof.'s talk is driving me up the wall.
68024	eng	His lectures are terribly boring.
68025	eng	You may ask a question of that teacher.
68026	eng	That teacher tends to be partial to female students.
68027	eng	For him a doctor to get lung cancer from smoking - it's a typical case of 'Do as I say not as I do.'
68028	eng	It is a pity that the teacher is leaving our school.
68029	eng	We all agree in liking the teacher.
68030	eng	Look at that mountain which is covered with snow.
68031	eng	That baby has charming eyes.
68032	eng	That baby is fat and healthy.
68033	eng	I can truly say that baby is ugly.
68034	eng	That baby will have slept five hours by noon.
68035	eng	Look at that red building.
68036	eng	That red tie doesn't go with your suit. Why don't you wear the green one?
68037	eng	That red dress becomes her.
68038	eng	That red sweater looks good on you.
68039	eng	That blue-white shining star is Sirius.
68040	eng	The young man was extremely money hungry.
68041	eng	Please look at the girl who wore the blue clothes.
68042	eng	That blue one is also mine.
68043	eng	That student is Tom.
68044	eng	That politician is full of ambition.
68045	eng	That politician is well versed in internal and external conditions.
68046	eng	The politician receives on Wednesdays.
68047	eng	That politician is by no means honest.
68048	eng	That politician is an old fox.
68049	eng	That politician has come down in the world since the so-called "Recruit scandal" was publicized.
68050	eng	The politician is as slippery as an eel!
68051	eng	That politician won't meet you unless you grease his palm.
68052	eng	What that politician said is not at all true.
68053	eng	That swimsuit looks really good on you.
68054	eng	I don't feel well after drinking that water.
68055	eng	Driving through that snowstorm was a nightmare.
68057	eng	Have you any idea who he is?
68058	eng	They are weary of their tedious work.
68059	eng	They have been working on the new building.
68060	eng	They must have suspected me of stealing.
68061	eng	What do they deal in?
68062	eng	They indulged in mahjong.
68063	eng	You can rely on their coming on time.
68064	eng	You can't count on their help.
68065	eng	It'll be useless to stand against them.
68066	eng	They are free from care and anxiety.
68067	eng	He's going to have a heart attack.
68068	eng	I hear that popular group will be disbanded.
68069	eng	He thinks me unkind, too.
68070	eng	He is not very fast at making friends.
68071	eng	Is she all right?
68072	eng	He is delightful.
68073	eng	He is an authority on physics.
68074	eng	He is a saint of a man.
68075	eng	He is hard to deal with.
68077	eng	He's the man that was here last week.
68078	eng	He is sixty, if a day.
68079	eng	People say she was an actress when she was young.
68080	eng	He is not really a friend, just an acquaintance.
68081	eng	It seems that he believes what he said is right.
68082	eng	That man is in love with my sister.
68083	eng	He is watching my every move.
68084	eng	He was critical of me.
68085	eng	He seems very hard on me, but he is really a very kind man.
68086	eng	He might be our new teacher.
68087	eng	He is our boss, and must be treated as such.
68088	eng	That's the man I've been waiting for a week.
68089	eng	He is only a passing chance acquaintance.
68090	eng	He says one thing and means another.
68091	eng	He is a cheerful old man.
68092	eng	I know him by name, but not by sight.
68093	eng	That person has a mole at the side of his eye.
68094	eng	How is he getting along with his school work?
68095	eng	I feel awkward in his presence.
68096	eng	He is always in the background.
68097	eng	He is a doctor and a university professor.
68098	eng	He may be a good man for all I know.
68099	eng	That man bows to me as if he knew me.
68100	eng	He is a man of striking individuality.
68101	eng	She remained my best friend till her dying day.
68102	eng	Tell me what that man is like.
68103	eng	He must be Tom's brother.
68104	eng	How long is he going to stay in Japan?
68105	eng	He makes a bad impression.
68106	eng	He's a man who doesn't make mistakes.
68107	eng	He easily gets angry.
68108	eng	He's been a patron of this store for many years.
68109	eng	That person will be read out of our club.
68110	eng	She looks young because of her makeup, but she is already more than forty years old.
68111	eng	He is a man who can always be trusted.
68112	eng	Nothing has been heard from him since he left for America.
68113	eng	He doesn't have long to live.
68114	eng	That man is too boastful for my liking.
68115	eng	He is far from suitable for that job.
68116	eng	Will he be able to come tomorrow?
68117	eng	Don't worry. He may look intimidating at first glance, but he's actually a very friendly person.
68118	eng	He had the impudence to cut across our garden.
68119	eng	Her daughter is bad at cooking.
68120	eng	I was distrustful of his motives.
68121	eng	I can't hold up my head before him.
68122	eng	Although the man's ideas are sound, because he can't express them well, he doesn't have a ghost of a chance of getting them accepted.
68123	eng	I cannot place confidence in his words.
68124	eng	Something in his face really reminded me of an old boyfriend of mine.
68125	eng	His singing outdoes a professional.
68126	eng	His house is near the subway.
68127	eng	His wife speaks Spanish as well as English.
68128	eng	People notice every move he makes.
68129	eng	He is not much to look at, I guess.
68130	eng	Shall I buy some for him?
68131	eng	Let's ask him.
68132	eng	I'm not about to ask him.
68133	eng	I'm rather hesitant about asking him a favor.
68134	eng	Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
68135	eng	He has knowledge, and experience as well.
68136	eng	I remember meeting that man at Cambridge before.
68138	eng	I am too amazed at him to say anything.
68139	eng	I haven't met him properly yet.
68140	eng	It will be rather difficult for him.
68141	eng	There were some unsavory rumors about him.
68142	eng	I suggest that you should write him a thank-you letter.
68143	eng	I am sick and tired of him.
68144	eng	It's easy for that man to compose a good poem.
68145	eng	You're better off not getting in his way!
68146	eng	I lent him some money, but he hasn't returned it yet.
68147	eng	Our meeting like that is probably the kind of thing that only happens once.
68148	eng	Every time you go out with him, it seems to rain. So we call him the rain man.
68149	eng	Don't get mixed up with those people.
68150	eng	Are you acquainted with the man?
68151	eng	He's so moody I have trouble keeping up with him.
68152	eng	He's the type who doesn't worry about details.
68153	eng	Those men are of a generation.
68155	eng	I often go fishing with them.
68156	eng	I wonder who they are.
68157	eng	They say that I'm an old woman.
68158	eng	They live in the house opposite to ours.
68159	eng	They are just going to the store over there.
68160	eng	They must have been overcome by the recent disasters.
68161	eng	Their baby is able to walk already.
68162	eng	Their hut is situated in the valley.
68163	eng	Their trouble stems from a trifling matter.
68164	eng	I wanted to show them my appreciation.
68165	eng	Will you help me give out the programs to those people?
68166	eng	It was rather easy for them.
68167	eng	I feel uncomfortable with those people.
68168	eng	May they live long!
68169	eng	Are those the people you saw yesterday?
68170	eng	While they were away on holiday, their neighbours looked after the dog.
68171	eng	As soon as they return, I will telephone you.
68172	eng	I hope neither of them was injured in the crash.
68173	eng	I don't know who that man is.
68174	eng	I don't know who the man is.
68175	eng	No one informed me of his failure.
68176	eng	He cannot be a poet.
68177	eng	He is directly above me.
68178	eng	That's the woman who wants to see you.
68179	eng	How long is it since you heard from him?
68180	eng	What happened to him?
68181	eng	I think it strange that he should lose his temper over that.
68182	eng	He reminds me of his father when he speaks.
68183	eng	Without him our company would cease to function.
68184	eng	That is the American about whom we talked yesterday.
68185	eng	I heard she brushed him off, saying "Let's just be friends."
68186	eng	That guy always goes over people's heads to get what he wants.
68187	eng	Who is that gentleman?
68188	eng	How hard he works!
68189	eng	That gentleman must be a doctor.
68190	eng	How did you come to know that gentleman?
68191	eng	That new company could flatten the competition.
68192	eng	That new movie was a bummer.
68193	eng	The food is sensational at that new restaurant.
68194	eng	Please let me off on this side of that traffic light.
68195	eng	I was at a loss what to do on that occasion.
68196	eng	That castle is beautiful.
68197	eng	That castle was built in ancient times.
68198	eng	The star which shines up there is Jupiter.
68199	eng	That boy is his brother.
68200	eng	That boy has good brains.
68202	eng	The young boy got sticky fingers when he walked into stores.
68203	eng	That boy is running.
68204	eng	The boy tried moving the heavy sofa.
68205	eng	That boy has black hair.
68206	eng	The young man is a handsome figure.
68207	eng	That boy is speaking English.
68208	eng	That boy often breaks our windows with a ball.
68209	eng	Is that boy Tom or Ben?
68210	eng	That boy is Tony, isn't he?
68211	eng	The boy seems to be coming in this direction.
68212	eng	That boy hit her child on purpose.
68213	eng	That boy's name is Shintaro Wada.
68214	eng	That boy's hair is black.
68215	eng	Those boys are in the first flush of youth.
68216	eng	How lazy those boys are!
68217	eng	Those boys are not good at speaking to these girls.
68218	eng	That girl is certainly a hard worker.
68219	eng	That girl is more cute than beautiful.
68220	eng	Who's that girl?
68221	eng	That girl is under the delusion that she is a princess.
68222	eng	That girl's eyes are blue.
68223	eng	The small retail outlet is only a front for a much larger entity.
68224	eng	That path is apt to be muddy after rain.
68225	eng	That novel was widely read.
68226	eng	That primary school has a strong soccer team.
68227	eng	That hut is crawling with lizards and insects.
68228	eng	That small star is brightest.
68229	eng	That little girl is my sister's friend.
68230	eng	That small one is also mine.
68231	eng	I'd still be spinning my wheels if I hadn't gotten that scholarship.
68232	eng	The merchant deals in silk goods.
68233	eng	That actress is as beautiful as ever.
68234	eng	I think that actress is one of the most beautiful women on earth.
68235	eng	That actress is the shining star in the company.
68236	eng	That woman is proud rather than vain.
68237	eng	That poor lady is disabled.
68238	eng	Who is that woman?
68239	eng	The lady really flipped out when she learned she had won a million dollars.
68240	eng	The woman served her purpose.
68241	eng	She is quite coquettish.
68242	eng	She came damn late.
68244	eng	She is always finding fault with other people.
68245	eng	That woman is much older than I.
68246	eng	That woman will be his wife.
68247	eng	That woman has two bags.
68248	eng	Look at the girls.
68249	eng	The young woman didn't know her boyfriend was loaded.
68250	eng	That girl is arrogant because of her beauty.
68251	eng	That girl is far from being shy.
68252	eng	I wonder who that girl is.
68253	eng	That girl is a true blue country singer.
68254	eng	The young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen.
68255	eng	How sad that girl looks!
68256	eng	That girl looks very pretty.
68257	eng	The girl had grown up without any money and when she married she became a spendthrift.
68258	eng	Which of those girls do you like?
68259	eng	Are you interested in that girl?
68260	eng	The girl may well think ill you.
68261	eng	How that woman runs on!
68262	eng	She is no beauty.
68263	eng	You don't have to be very old to remember that event.
68264	eng	That publishing company is in the black.
68265	eng	Can you manage to carry that heavy suitcase by yourself?
68266	eng	That religious cult has got some pretty off the wall ideas.
68267	eng	That kind of dress is now in fashion.
68268	eng	Those young men are independent of their parents.
68269	eng	That young man is very keen on cycling.
68270	eng	That young man is our teacher.
68271	eng	The agent built up the young singer.
68272	eng	Are you going to buy that auto?
68273	eng	Follow the car.
68274	eng	That car is hers.
68275	eng	That car is a real beauty.
68276	eng	That car is mine.
68277	eng	That car is too expensive for me to buy.
68278	eng	That car is the best deal for your money.
68279	eng	You seem to have had that car for years.
68281	eng	That car is the most beautiful of the three.
68282	eng	That car salesman was a pretty off the wall kind of guy.
68283	eng	That president's secretary is always prim.
68284	eng	The president is difficult to approach.
68285	eng	There was a problem with the architecture of that company's new computer. They're going through a recall frenzy right now.
68286	eng	Please take a look at that picture.
68287	eng	Where's that picture hiding?
68288	eng	That copy differs from the original.
68289	eng	I never see that play without crying.
68290	eng	That bicycle belongs to our school.
68291	eng	The chances of success are greater if the business man knows the ropes, and also has more funds at his disposal.
68292	eng	The price of that bicycle was too high.
68293	eng	I wish I had been kind to her then.
68294	eng	I wish I had obeyed his directions.
68295	eng	I was reading a novel then.
68296	eng	If he had taken my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
68297	eng	Is that clock working?
68298	eng	At the time I managed to make myself understood in English.
68299	eng	That clock is one minute fast.
68300	eng	I wish I had been with you then.
68301	eng	I have not seen him since.
68302	eng	If he had worked hard at that time, he would have succeeded.
68303	eng	You know, I had a lot of fun.
68304	eng	Were you sober at that time?
68305	eng	I cannot express how pleased I was then.
68306	eng	I wish I had treated the girl more kindly at that time.
68307	eng	If she had married you, she would be happy now.
68308	eng	His health has declined since the accident.
68309	eng	That accident brought home to me the power of nature.
68310	eng	That accident is a good illustration of his carelessness.
68311	eng	She was never completely free from pain after the accident.
68312	eng	There is something mysterious about the accident.
68313	eng	Do you know what time that accident happened?
68314	eng	Who will hear the case?
68315	eng	That incident was a black mark against the president.
68316	eng	That incident is printed on my mind.
68317	eng	That branch is affiliated to the miners' union.
68318	eng	The children thought that their parents were made of money.
68319	eng	The child captivates everyone with his sunny smile.
68320	eng	The child came near being drowned.
68321	eng	Those children use bad words.
68322	eng	Those children are waiting for their mother.
68323	eng	I'm against us forcing the child to go to cram school.
68324	eng	You shouldn't indulge that child. It will make him very selfish.
68325	eng	He will soon be past playing with toys.
68326	eng	That child is full of mischief.
68327	eng	He is a slim child.
68328	eng	She was named Kate after her mother.
68329	eng	He is very mean to me.
68330	eng	The boy isn't as bad as he seemed.
68331	eng	I wonder what ever will become of the child.
68332	eng	The boy often runs errands.
68333	eng	The kid looks blank.
68334	eng	What a little imp he is!
68335	eng	What a nuisance that child is!
68336	eng	That boy is a handful.
68337	eng	That child is impossible.
68338	eng	She is always smiling.
68339	eng	That child is always fretting.
68340	eng	The child is dirty.
68341	eng	That child can count to twenty.
68342	eng	You have to allow for the boy's age.
68343	eng	The mother of that child is an announcer.
68344	eng	That child is a headache.
68345	eng	The child puts adults to shame.
68346	eng	That girl just drives me wild.
68347	eng	The kid is a pain in the neck.
68348	eng	That boy of mine! He'll eat me out of house and home!
68349	eng	What were you doing when she came?
68350	eng	If that boy had not been killed in the traffic accident, he would be a college student now.
68351	eng	That child's constant screaming gives me gray hairs.
68352	eng	I think that girl cut her hair to give herself a new look.
68353	eng	How well that girl skis!
68354	eng	The sisters are quite unlike.
68355	eng	I did that work on the orders of my boss.
68356	eng	The job offer still stands.
68357	eng	What's the name of the mountain range?
68358	eng	Look at that mountain.
68359	eng	That mountain is covered with snow.
68360	eng	The mountain used to send out clouds of smoke.
68361	eng	That mountain is in the clouds.
68362	eng	How high mountain that is!
68363	eng	How high is that mountain?
68364	eng	That mountain is five times as high as this one.
68365	eng	That mountain is about three thousand meters high.
68366	eng	The top of that mountain is flat.
68368	eng	It is dangerous to climb that mountain.
68369	eng	You need good equipment to climb that mountain.
68370	eng	We are going to climb that mountain.
68371	eng	Are you done with that magazine?
68372	eng	I found nothing interesting in that magazine.
68373	eng	I cannot put up with all that noise.
68374	eng	The writer has an excellent style.
68375	eng	Six months have passed since the author was killed in an accident.
68376	eng	The confidence man and his blonde call girl make a perfect match in enraging his landlady.
68377	eng	If only I had listened to my parents!
68378	eng	There was hatred between us then.
68379	eng	We were younger then.
68380	eng	Look at those black clouds.
68381	eng	Who is the gentleman all dressed in black?
68383	eng	That black one is mine.
68384	eng	Look at those black clouds. It is going to rain.
68385	eng	Is that black bag yours?
68386	eng	There seems no need to help that country.
68387	eng	That country is five times as large as Japan.
68388	eng	That country abounds in oil.
68389	eng	That country broke off diplomatic relations with the neighboring countries.
68390	eng	That country's economic situation changes from day to day.
68391	eng	That country is where individuality counts.

70289	eng	You think I have nothing to do; but on the contrary, I am very busy.
70290	eng	Did you use my camera?
70291	eng	Do you want me to make coffee?
70292	eng	You've sure got a short fuse today.
70295	eng	Did you carry out your plan?
70296	eng	What time do you go home?
70298	eng	You must study your whole life.
70299	eng	Do you use a word processor?
70300	eng	How often do you wash your car a month?
70301	eng	Do you take part in any community activities?
70302	eng	No matter how capable you are, you're not going to get a promotion.
70304	eng	Do you have a hobby - for example, painting?
70305	eng	As soon as you have done that, I would like you to start preparing supper.
70306	eng	You shall see greater things than that.
70307	eng	You should keep in touch with Mr Smith.
70309	eng	Have you ever heard her sing on the stage?
70310	eng	You must consider this problem as a whole.
70311	eng	You are both pretty and kind.
70312	eng	You say one thing and then act just the opposite.
70313	eng	Did you read that thick book?
70314	eng	Are you satisfied with your job?
70315	eng	Remembering when I dreamed in your arms.
70316	eng	I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your talk.
70317	eng	Go on with your story. That is so interesting!
70319	eng	Tell me your story. I am all ears.
70320	eng	I can't possibly think your story is true.
70321	eng	Your speech was far from satisfactory.
70322	eng	I can't follow you.
70323	eng	Your story doesn't square with the facts.
70324	eng	You have a very crisp way of speaking.
70325	eng	I doubt your good sense.
70326	eng	Do your parents agree to your becoming a flight attendant?
70327	eng	Your parents kept an eye on us.
70328	eng	If your parents heard of your success, they would be proud of you.
70329	eng	I'll look after your child while you are away.
70330	eng	A Mr Jones came while you were out.
70331	eng	I can understand your position perfectly.
70332	eng	I would like to hear your honest opinion.
70333	eng	I wouldn't go so far as to say your theory is completely wrong.
70335	eng	I will give you whatever you want.
70336	eng	Your summary leaves nothing to be desired.
70337	eng	I cannot answer your request offhand.

70340	eng	We'll take care of reconfirmation of your reservation.
70341	eng	I'm sorry I opened your mail by mistake.
70342	eng	Is anyone coming besides your friends?
70343	eng	What time did your friend go home?
70344	eng	When did your friend leave for America?
70346	eng	Say hello to your friends.
70347	eng	If your friend reminds you kindly of your faults, take what he says not only pleasantly, but thankfully.
70348	eng	Had it not been for your courage, we would have been killed.
70349	eng	I am filled with admiration for your bravery.
70350	eng	I bow to your superior judgement.
70351	eng	Compare your translation with his.
70352	eng	I appreciate your problem.

70374	eng	Your dream will come true in the near future.
70375	eng	Your dreams have come true.
70376	eng	May all your dreams come true!
70377	eng	Your pulse is normal.
70378	eng	To your future!
70379	eng	Your sister is the most diligent of all my friends.
70380	eng	Your sister can not speak English.
70381	eng	Is your sister swimming in the river?
70382	eng	I'd like to see your sister.
70383	eng	That sister of yours is always complaining of her husband.
70384	eng	Who does your sister take after?
70385	eng	Listen to me carefully with your book closed.
70386	eng	Will you lend me your book?
70387	eng	Lend me your book, please.
70388	eng	Please lend me your book.

70402	eng	What is your mother tongue?
70403	eng	Your answer almost amounts to a threat.

70405	eng	Your dress is already out of fashion.
70406	eng	You're a month behind in your rent.

70420	eng	It's your turn. Please come this way.
70421	eng	You are correct in your judgement.
70422	eng	What long hair you've got!
70423	eng	Your hair needs cutting.

70437	eng	Your answer doesn't make sense.
70438	eng	Your answer differs from mine.
70439	eng	Your answer is correct.

70453	eng	Your suggestion seems irrelevant to our discussion here.
70454	eng	Your suggestion seems reasonable.
70455	eng	I'm all for your suggestion.
70456	eng	It has not yet been decided whether to approve of your proposal.
70457	eng	Stop playing tricks on your brother.
70458	eng	Your subscription expires with the June issue.
70459	eng	Can you show me any evidence for your statement?
70460	eng	I interpreted your silence as consent.
70461	eng	What are your strong points?
70462	eng	I can spot you from a distance with your long, white hair.
70463	eng	I look forward to seeing you on my next trip to your city.
70464	eng	I wish I had listened to your advice.
70465	eng	Your advice will have no effect on them.
70466	eng	I daresay your advice will have its effect on them.
70469	eng	Thanks to your advice, I got over the hardship.
70470	eng	Without your advice, I would have been at a loss.
70471	eng	Acting on your advice, I've decided to exercise more regularly.
70472	eng	If it were not for your advice I would fail.

70474	eng	Had it not been for your advice he would have been ruined.
70475	eng	I bought a pen for your birthday present.
70477	eng	Who is your favorite actor?
70478	eng	I will go to see him instead of you.
70479	eng	Shall I answer this letter for you?
70480	eng	I will compensate you for your loss.
70481	eng	You are rude.
70482	eng	You should have your son independent of you.
70483	eng	What does your son want to be when he grows up?
70484	eng	It won't be your fault if your son does anything wrong: he is twenty-five now, isn't he?
70486	eng	The address you are looking for is within a stone's throw of the city hall.
70487	eng	Who sings the best of all the boys in your class?
70488	eng	Don't forget to give my best regards to your lovely wife.
70489	eng	Do you know your forefather?
70490	eng	Your goodwill sank into my heart.
70491	eng	Look at the sign just ahead of you.
70492	eng	Your shipment should be delivered within twenty four hours.
70493	eng	Your explanation is too abstract to me.
70494	eng	Please show me your stamp album.
70495	eng	Don't leave your baby crying.
70496	eng	Is your baby sleeping?
70497	eng	I didn't think this was your seat.
70498	eng	I misplaced your blue pen.
70499	eng	Your voice reminds me of my late grandmother.
70500	eng	I am happy to hear your voice.
70501	eng	I would like to hear your voice, too.
70502	eng	Your voice reminds me of your mother.

70511	eng	How do you pronounce your last name?
70512	eng	Please allow me to measure you.
70513	eng	I didn't catch your last name.
70514	eng	I can't thank you enough for your kindness.
70515	eng	Your guess is quite wrong.
70516	eng	Your guess is wrong.
70518	eng	Your prompt reply is urgently required.
70519	eng	What is your ultimate goal in your life?
70520	eng	I don't care about your race or age or religion.
70521	eng	One of the greatest dangers in your human relations is self-centeredness.
70523	eng	How tall are you, and how much do you weigh?
70526	eng	I will never forget your kindness.
70527	eng	You were so nice to me, and I had a really pleasant trip. Thanks so much.

70537	eng	Your new car looks awfully expensive to me.
70538	eng	I cannot help admiring your new car.
70539	eng	Could you enlarge on your new theory?
70540	eng	Your new friends may laugh at some of the things you do.
70541	eng	I just adore your new hat.
70542	eng	I have to put down your new address.
70543	eng	Let me know your new address.
70545	eng	Is your new car behaving well?
70546	eng	You had better supplement your diet with vitamins.
70548	eng	No matter what your profession, or how happy you may be in it, there are moments when you wish you had chosen some other career.
70549	eng	Your analysis of the situation is accurate.
70550	eng	Your train leaves from Platform 10.
70551	eng	What flight were you on?
70552	eng	How do you like your boss's plan?
70553	eng	If your boss "sacks" you, it means you're fired.
70554	eng	How old is your elder son?
70555	eng	Your detailed explanation of the situation has let me see the light.
70556	eng	I am sure your promotion was timely and well deserved.
70557	eng	Can I be of any assistance to you?
70558	eng	If it had not been for your help, he would have been ruined.
70559	eng	I deeply appreciate your advice and kindness.
70560	eng	We do need your advice.
70563	eng	But for your help I could not have got over the hardship.
70564	eng	But for your help, I would have failed.
70565	eng	But for your help, we should not have finished in time.
70566	eng	If it were not for your help, I could not have succeeded.
70567	eng	What are you going to do with your first pay?
70568	eng	Let's leave when you are ready.
70569	eng	I will see to it that everything is ready for your departure.
70570	eng	What should we do with this white elephant your aunt gave us? It's way too ugly to go on the wall.
70572	eng	I want to talk with your uncle.
70573	eng	Let me know your address.
70574	eng	Don't read evil intentions into the ordinary actions of people around you.
70575	eng	Your job hangs by a thread.
70576	eng	Tell me what your hobby is.
70577	eng	Please tell me about your hobbies.
70578	eng	If it had not been for your help, I might have failed.
70582	eng	Your letter crossed mine.
70583	eng	I think your letter is under that book.
70584	eng	It was careless of me to forget to answer your letter.
70585	eng	Your hands need washing.
70587	eng	Would you mind my moving your car?
70589	eng	Would you mind if I used your car?
70590	eng	This car of yours is a real gas guzzler.
70591	eng	Your car exceeded the speed limit.
70592	eng	Your car handles easily.
70593	eng	Your car is three times as big as this one.
70594	eng	Your car was washed by Ken.
70595	eng	I will make up for the damage I did to your car.
70597	eng	May I take a picture of you?
70598	eng	Show your photograph.
70599	eng	Can I keep one of your pictures?
70600	eng	Your question is very hard to answer.
70601	eng	Your question is hard to answer.
70602	eng	It is a matter of principle with him to answer your questions honestly.
70603	eng	Lend me your dictionary, please.
70606	eng	Will you lend your dictionary to me?
70607	eng	Can I use your dictionary?
70608	eng	I've had enough of your boasts.
70609	eng	Can you account for your car accident?
70610	eng	Lend me your bicycle.
70611	eng	Your bicycle is better than mine.
70612	eng	You will find your bicycle somewhere in the neighborhood of the station.
70613	eng	After you with the salt.
70614	eng	Your watch is superior in quality to mine.
70615	eng	I will have repaired your watch by tomorrow.
70616	eng	Your watch is on the desk.
70619	eng	Your watch has been found.
70620	eng	Does your watch keep good time?
70621	eng	Try to make good use of your time.
70622	eng	Shall I come to your office?
70623	eng	What is your name?
70624	eng	A 10% tax will be withheld from the payment to you.
70625	eng	I'll do it according to your instructions.
70626	eng	It was my book that your child tore to pieces.
70627	eng	What is your older sister doing now?
70628	eng	Your sister is a good pianist, isn't she?
70629	eng	I want the same dictionary that your sister has.
70632	eng	You've finished your work.
70633	eng	I'm afraid the job I've got for you won't be easy.
70635	eng	Your work is not altogether satisfactory.
70636	eng	Your work is far from being satisfactory.
70637	eng	Let me help you to do the work.
70638	eng	You won't succeed unless you attend to your work.
70639	eng	Just go about your business and don't keep looking at me.
70640	eng	We will meet after you have finished your work.
70641	eng	I will carry it out if you agree to our plan.
70642	eng	May I accompany you on your walk?
70643	eng	We encourage your participation.
70644	eng	Can I borrow your umbrella?
70645	eng	Your composition is not altogether bad.
70646	eng	Your composition is far from perfect.
70647	eng	There are few, if any, errors in your composition.
70648	eng	Would you show us some samples of your work?
70649	eng	Let me sample your cake.
70650	eng	Your purse is similar to mine.
70651	eng	Your wallet is on the television set.
70652	eng	We are counting on you for financial help.
70653	eng	It's much cheaper to live on grains and vegetables you can grow in your garden.
70654	eng	I would like to get your latest catalogue.
70655	eng	Do you have a recent photo of yourself?
70656	eng	Your left eye is congested.
70657	eng	You'll see the store on your left.
70658	eng	Tell me something about your country.
70659	eng	Do you have much snow in your country?
70660	eng	Do you eat seaweed in your country?
70662	eng	Do people drink tea in your country?
70663	eng	Your conduct allows of no excuse.
70664	eng	Your behavior does not come up to my expectations.
70665	eng	We ask you to account for your conduct.
70666	eng	I will follow you wherever you go.
70667	eng	Your conduct gave rise to another problem.
70668	eng	I really agree with what you're saying.
70669	eng	Please tell me what you think.
70670	eng	Your idea is similar to mine.
70671	eng	Your ideas are in accord with ours.
70672	eng	Your ideas are hardly practical.
70673	eng	Your ideas are all out of date.
70674	eng	Your idea is, as it were, a castle in the air.
70675	eng	I don't know your preference, so please help yourself.
70676	eng	You may choose any book you like.
70678	eng	You may give the ticket to whomever you like.
70679	eng	What's your favorite food?
70680	eng	Who is your favorite composer?
70681	eng	Who is your favorite author?
70682	eng	You can spend your time in any way you want; it's your time, after all.
70683	eng	You can have any you want.
70684	eng	What is your favorite TV program?
70685	eng	I'll buy you whatever clothes you want.
70686	eng	I am very pleased to hear of your success.
70687	eng	We are grateful to you for your help.
70688	eng	Please close the door behind you.
70689	eng	He is always at your back.
70690	eng	After you with the pepper.
70691	eng	Judging from what you say, he must be a great writer.
70692	eng	Don't you think you're putting the cart before the horse?
70693	eng	What you are saying is absolutely wrong.
70694	eng	I don't understand what you are talking about.
70695	eng	Your remarks were out of place.
70697	eng	What you said is not true.
70699	eng	What you said is, in a sense, true.
70700	eng	What you said is right in a sense, but it made her angry.
70701	eng	Your remarks were rather out of place.
70702	eng	I can't fathom what you said.
70703	eng	I guess you're right, Jane.
70704	eng	Granting that you are right, we still can't approve of your plan.
70705	eng	Maybe you're right.
70706	eng	You may be right about that.
70707	eng	Admitting what you say, I still think he is wrong.
70708	eng	While I see what you say, I can't agree with you.
70709	eng	I cannot agree with you on the matter.
70710	eng	I cannot follow you.
70711	eng	We will check to see if what you have said is really the truth.
70712	eng	I understand what you mean.
70713	eng	Accepting what you say, I'm still against the project.
70714	eng	You could be right, I suppose.
70715	eng	It is difficult to believe what you say.
70716	eng	What you say does not make any sense to me.
70718	eng	What you say is true in a sense.
70720	eng	I can not but admit the truth of your remarks.
70721	eng	Could you tell me your present address?
70722	eng	Please tell me your present address.
70723	eng	Your views are quite opposite to mine.
70724	eng	Your research will surely bear fruit.
70725	eng	Your dog is big and mine is small.
70727	eng	Your dog always barks at me.
70728	eng	I'm not trying to deprive you of your rights.
70729	eng	I am anxious about your health.
70730	eng	What's your blood group?
70731	eng	I'm really pleased at the news of your marriage.
70732	eng	There are few but admire your resolution.
70733	eng	Even your faults do not lessen my respect for you, and in friendship this is what counts.
70734	eng	Your words of encouragement meant a lot to me.
70735	eng	Without your encouragement, I should have given up the plan.
70736	eng	A favorable review of your play will appear in the next issue.
70737	eng	Your plan must fit in with mine.
70738	eng	Tell me all about your plan.
70739	eng	Your plan is a good one, but mine is a better one.
70740	eng	Your plan requires a large amount of money.
70741	eng	Your plan has the virtue of being practical.
70742	eng	Your plan is not in line with our policy.
70743	eng	Your plan is sure to succeed.
70744	eng	I agree to your plan.
70745	eng	I want to be in your plan.
70746	eng	I will not object to your plan.
70747	eng	I'm all for your plan.
70748	eng	I can't keep pace with your plan.
70750	eng	You cannot depend on his support for your project.
70751	eng	I hope your plan will work out.
70752	eng	May we know your bank account?
70753	eng	Read such books as interest you.
70754	eng	Should I have asked your permission?
70755	eng	Is your salary adequate to support your family?
70756	eng	Is your salary keeping up with inflation?
70757	eng	You will be paid a stable base salary plus commissions on sale.
70758	eng	You should try to conquer your smoking habit.
70759	eng	Your argument came across well.
70760	eng	Your duty is to support your family.
70761	eng	If it weren't for your invaluable help, everything would be ruined.
70762	eng	Your prayer will be answered.
70763	eng	I know exactly how you feel.
70764	eng	Could I use your desk?
70765	eng	Your gift will go far towards helping to build the children's hospital.
70766	eng	Attach a recent photograph to your application form.
70767	eng	Please give me your picture lest I forget how you look.
70768	eng	I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
70769	eng	Shall I carry your bag?
70770	eng	Which is your bag?
70771	eng	Your college years will soon come to an end.
70772	eng	I want to know more about your school life.
70773	eng	I am looking forward to visiting your school.
70774	eng	Is your school in this town?
70776	eng	Is your school far from here?
70777	eng	How many students are there in your school?
70778	eng	Could you tell me something about your school?
70779	eng	Does every boy have to learn cooking in your school?
70780	eng	Is Japanese taught in your school now?
70781	eng	How many people live in your town?
70782	eng	Your answer is anything but satisfactory to us.
70783	eng	Don't lay your fault at my door.
70784	eng	Let me relieve you of your baggage.
70786	eng	It looks like your luggage is on the next flight.
70787	eng	Do you only have this bag with you?
70788	eng	It's your turn to sing.
70789	eng	Please write about your home.
70790	eng	Your family must be very nice.
70791	eng	We are all looking forward to seeing your family.
70793	eng	I had no difficulty finding your house.
70794	eng	Zeal for your house will consume me.
70795	eng	Your house needs painting.
70796	eng	Your house has a very cozy atmosphere.
70797	eng	Whose house is opposite to yours?
70798	eng	I'll pick you up at your home.
70799	eng	How about your place?
70800	eng	What do you call your father?
70802	eng	How long does it take you to get here from your house by train?
70803	eng	How many rooms are there on the second floor of your house?
70805	eng	Your wife ought to tell you all about it.
70806	eng	Will you lend me your pencil?
70807	eng	Could I use your pencil?
70808	eng	Your assistance is indispensable for us.
70809	eng	Thanks to your help, we were successful.
70810	eng	I'm very grateful for your help.
70811	eng	I'd appreciate your help.
70812	eng	Were it not for your help, I should fail.
70813	eng	We cannot thank you too much for your help.
70814	eng	Your help prevented me from being ruined.
70815	eng	Without your support, we probably won't be able to put this plan into practice.
70816	eng	Without your aid, I couldn't have succeeded.
70817	eng	Without your help, I would have failed.
70818	eng	Had it not been for your help, I could not have done it.
70819	eng	Without your help, I couldn't have finished the work.
70821	eng	Your English composition leaves almost nothing to be desired.
70823	eng	Your English is too good to be in this class.
70824	eng	Your English leaves much to be desired.
70825	eng	Let me take a look at your driver's license.
70826	eng	I've heard about you.
70827	eng	Who is your favorite TV star?
70828	eng	How tall is your youngest brother?
70829	eng	I'll send you your clothes and some other things next month by express delivery.
70832	eng	Please don't limit your opinions just to 'Yes' or 'No'.
70833	eng	Your opinion sounds like a good idea.
70834	eng	How does your opinion differ from his?
70835	eng	Your opinion seems to be out of date.
70836	eng	Your opinion is quite different from mine.
70837	eng	Your idea runs counter to our policy.
70838	eng	Your idea has no foundation at all.
70839	eng	Your ideas sound crazy.
70840	eng	Your opinions are right in a way.
70841	eng	What's your opinion?
70842	eng	I am for your opinion.
70843	eng	They will give way to you if your opinion is reasonable.
70844	eng	But for your steady support, my mission would have resulted in failure.
70845	eng	I would like to use your word processor.
70846	eng	Your robot will prepare meals, clean, wash dishes, and perform other household tasks.
70847	eng	Do you think you could lend me some of your records?
70848	eng	Take a fresh look at your lifestyle.
70849	eng	I want to be a good player like you.
70850	eng	I wish I could speak English like you.
70851	eng	I wish I had a friend like you.
70852	eng	Because a man whose manners are as bad as yours must try everyone's patience.
70853	eng	Devote your whole attention to your duties.
70854	eng	Give your whole attention to what you are doing.
70855	eng	I lost your mail address.
70856	eng	I want you to live more like a human being.
70857	eng	You can have any picture that you want.
70858	eng	Your boyfriend got tired of waiting for you and left just now.
70859	eng	I would like to be your pen pal.
70860	eng	Which is your pen?
70861	eng	Would you please make a hyperlink to our corporate site from your page?
70863	eng	Yours is a very strange story.
70864	eng	Yours is over there.
70865	eng	I was anxious to read your letter from Paris.
70866	eng	Please allow me to carry your bag.
70867	eng	Your personal computer is identical with mine.
70868	eng	If it had not been for your foolishness, we would never have been in that trouble.
70869	eng	Please show me your notebook.
70870	eng	I will be happy to attend your party.
70871	eng	Have your roses come out yet?
70873	eng	When do you plan to check out?
70874	eng	Your team is very good, but theirs is the best.
70875	eng	Who is your dance partner?
70876	eng	I will find you your lost ring.
70877	eng	I painted a picture for you.
70880	eng	I've ordered you some dessert.
70881	eng	I think I should do it for you.
70882	eng	Let me get you a ticket to the concert.
70883	eng	Shall I get some for you?
70884	eng	I asked Mom to get some for you.
70885	eng	I am quite willing to do anything for you.
70887	eng	Your account of the accident corresponds with the driver's.
70888	eng	Your speech was appropriate for the occasion.
70889	eng	What's your score?
70890	eng	Choose a dress you like.
70891	eng	Place your skis in an inverted V.
70892	eng	Your skirt is out of fashion.
70893	eng	Your shirts need to be washed.
70894	eng	Do whatever you want.
70895	eng	I like your sarong style skirt.
70896	eng	May I have a signature?
70897	eng	Your site appeals to people who are interested in cats.
70899	eng	I hope that your parents will allow us to marry.
70900	eng	Please do the work at your own convenience.
70901	eng	Your order is ready.
70902	eng	I rejoice in your success.
70903	eng	May this letter find you well and happy!
70904	eng	Your kindness really touches me.
70906	eng	I greatly appreciate your kindness.
70907	eng	We'll never forget your kindness.
70913	eng	I appreciate your invitation, but...
70914	eng	I am very thankful to you for your advice.
70915	eng	Is your husband a picky eater?
70916	eng	I am very happy to hear about your engagement.
70917	eng	How are your studies going?
70918	eng	We know we may count on your cooperation.
70919	eng	I am in full accord with your view.
70920	eng	I think your favourite actress is in it.
70921	eng	Where did you get this photo taken?
70922	eng	I can't think of you as more than a friend.
70924	eng	What should I call you?
70925	eng	I don't mean you.
70926	eng	I'll never forget you.
70927	eng	I didn't quite catch your words.
70929	eng	I hope and I know you did great!
70930	eng	I am quite pleased with you.
70931	eng	How many boys are there in your class?
70932	eng	How many pupils are there in your class?
70933	eng	Your colorful shirt really stands out.
70934	eng	Your bag is on my desk.
70936	eng	That sounds very interesting.
70937	eng	Do you mind my sitting next to you?
70938	eng	I am afraid I can't help you.
70939	eng	I'll be very happy if I can serve you.
70942	eng	Could you spell your name, please?
70943	eng	What's your name and flight number?
70944	eng	Can your mother drive a car?
70945	eng	Your mother is trying to break up our marriage.
70946	eng	Your mother will be back before long.
70947	eng	Your mother will get well soon.
70948	eng	Is your mother at home now?
70949	eng	How is your mother?
70950	eng	Your mother is very young, isn't she?
70951	eng	Please give my best regards to your mother.
70952	eng	Were your mother and father home?
70953	eng	Did your mother make those?
70955	eng	Are you proud of your father?
70956	eng	Suppose your father saw us together, what would he say?
70957	eng	Your father is tall.
70958	eng	Is your father a teacher?
70959	eng	What time does your father leave for his office?
70960	eng	How old is your father?
70961	eng	Your father has been in Paris, hasn't he?
70966	eng	Your father seems very nice.
70967	eng	I am acquainted with your father.
70968	eng	Not only your father but also I am against your plan.
70969	eng	Do you know where your father went?
70970	eng	I'm worried whether your house was involved or not.
70971	eng	We are glad to help you.
70972	eng	Your sister didn't go on a trip, did she?
70973	eng	Your sister has a sense of beauty.
70974	eng	Your sister cannot swim well, can she?
70975	eng	Where does your sister go to school?
70976	eng	What's your favourite pastime?
70977	eng	After what you have said, I shall be careful.
70978	eng	Everything came out satisfactorily through your good offices.
70980	eng	Tell me that story you heard from your brother.
70981	eng	Deposit your money in the bank.
70982	eng	What's your favorite television program?
70983	eng	I can hardly wait till I see you.
70984	eng	You make life worth living.
70985	eng	I cannot thank you too much for your hospitality.
70986	eng	Your grandmother is a charming lady.
70988	eng	Whatever you say.
70990	eng	I will do as you say.
70991	eng	Even given what you say, I still think you are to blame.
70992	eng	What you're saying is perfectly viable, but I can't shake off my unease.
70993	eng	I can't hear you very well.
70995	eng	I was interested in your remark.
70996	eng	I can't make heads or tails of what you said.
70997	eng	How old is your uncle?
70998	eng	Your uncle took these pictures, didn't he?
70999	eng	I owe my success to you.
71000	eng	How old is your grandfather?
71001	eng	Thanks to your help, I was able to finish early.
71003	eng	Check your order.
71004	eng	Your order has been submitted.
71006	eng	We are all looking forward to your coming.
71007	eng	I've often heard about you.
71008	eng	You have only to do as you were told.
71009	eng	You were so late coming that I was just about to telephone you.
71010	eng	It's just like you say.
71011	eng	What you say does not bear on our problem.
71012	eng	You're right in a sense.
71013	eng	You don't practice what you preach.
71014	eng	Will you show me your album?
71016	eng	Your advice counted for much.
71017	eng	I cannot do without your advice.
71018	eng	Without your advice, I would have failed in the attempt.
71019	eng	Will you lend me your CD player for an hour?
71020	eng	Let me give you an example.
71021	eng	You can hardly expect me to help you.
71022	eng	May I count on you to get me the job?
71023	eng	May I request a favour of you?
71024	eng	Mail for you will be held until you call for it.
71025	eng	Read such a book as will be useful to you.
71026	eng	There's a lady asking for you.
71027	eng	The time has come when I must tell you the truth.
71028	eng	I gave you a book.
71029	eng	Let me introduce my mother to you.
71030	eng	I'm about to tell you the answer.
71031	eng	I'd like you to be my partner.
71032	eng	Do I pay you or the cashier?
71033	eng	Little did I dream of doing you any harm.
71035	eng	Many people would agree with you.
71036	eng	You're wanted on the phone. It's from Tom.
71037	eng	I would like you to assist me with my gardening.
71038	eng	Let me show you many things which will be novel to you.
71039	eng	I wish I had asked you for advice.
71040	eng	I'll do your shopping, clean up the house, and cook your dinner for you.
71041	eng	I have something to talk over with you.
71042	eng	I didn't get your last name.
71043	eng	There's a man at the door who wants to see you at all costs.
71044	eng	I'll make you a present of a doll.
71046	eng	I will buy you a new word processor.
71047	eng	Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
71048	eng	The president of the company, to whom I introduced you, wants to see you again.
71049	eng	I wanted you to help me with my homework.
71050	eng	I meant to have written to you.
71052	eng	I must beg your pardon.
71053	eng	Might I ask you a question?
71054	eng	May I ask you a question?
71055	eng	I'll tell you about my father.
71056	eng	I will tell you the history of my life.
71057	eng	I will show you my new car.
71058	eng	I am sending you a picture of my family.
71059	eng	I want you to stay with me.
71060	eng	I would like you to go home with me.
71061	eng	We would like you to join our company.
71062	eng	We do not insist that you do things our way.
71063	eng	I am pleased to see you again.
71065	eng	I submit this plan for your consideration.
71066	eng	I will show you how to go to the park.
71067	eng	I tell you this.
71069	eng	I was scared that you might leave me.
71070	eng	I have no intention of telling you the result.
71071	eng	There is an urgent message for you.
71072	eng	I don't have the authority to give you the green light.
71073	eng	I have urgent business with you.
71074	eng	He won't do you any harm.
71075	eng	Here's to you!
71076	eng	I'd like for you to go.
71078	eng	I never see you without thinking of my father.
71079	eng	I am very glad to see you.
71080	eng	It was very nice seeing you again.
71081	eng	It's great to meet you.
71083	eng	Every time I see you, I think of your father.
71085	eng	Whenever I see you, I feel happy.
71086	eng	I never see you without thinking of my mother.
71087	eng	A Mr Ono called to see you.
71088	eng	There is a man at the door who wants to see you.
71089	eng	There's an American girl who wants to see you.
71090	eng	There is a gentleman to see you.
71091	eng	A man who wanted to see you came while you were out.
71092	eng	There's somebody who wants to meet you.
71093	eng	I'd rather you stayed at home.
71094	eng	I will show you some pictures.
71095	eng	Shall I give you something to read?
71096	eng	Let me get you something to drink.
71098	eng	I keep nothing from you.
71099	eng	I'd like to give you a piece of advice.
71100	eng	I have no secrets from you.
71102	eng	I fancy we've met before.
71103	eng	I have good news for you.
71110	eng	What takes you only three days, takes me as many weeks.
71111	eng	I hope you won't mind if I give you some advice.
71114	eng	You have a large family to support; don't play for high stakes.
71116	eng	You heard from him?
71117	eng	You can't imagine it, can you?
71118	eng	You have two brothers.
71119	eng	You'll be told in advance.
71120	eng	I have never clapped eyes on you before.
71121	eng	You have the right to the truth.
71124	eng	I cannot agree with you.
71125	eng	It may seem trivial to you, but for me it's worth paying attention to.
71126	eng	I would have you apply yourself to your studies.
71127	eng	Do you have any brothers?
71131	eng	You may be able to read the handwriting on the wall, but it is Greek to me.
71134	eng	Maybe you don't know this, but nobody could ever take your place.
71135	eng	You have a sense of humor.
71136	eng	I should have told you everything earlier.
71137	eng	Should I have asked you first?
71139	eng	I have a great esteem for you.
71140	eng	Do you have many hobbies?
71141	eng	You have no right to go there.
71143	eng	I am ready to do anything that I can for you, because I owe you a great deal.
71144	eng	I cannot lend this book to you.
71146	eng	You'll be in charge of the girls working in this factory.
71147	eng	Remember I will always be at your back.
71149	eng	It looks very good on you.
71150	eng	Choose friends you can rely on.
71151	eng	When will it be convenient for you?
71152	eng	I will give you the money.
71153	eng	I shall let you see that.
71154	eng	I had hoped to meet you there.
71155	eng	I'll leave everything to you.
71156	eng	This is all I can do for you.
71157	eng	I'd like you to read this book.
71158	eng	I'd like you to translate this book into English.
71159	eng	I can't lend you this book.
71160	eng	I am looking forward to seeing you in this town.
71161	eng	You are the last person I would have expected to see here.
71162	eng	I am glad to run into you here.
71163	eng	I have something good to tell you.
71164	eng	There is a lady downstairs who wants to speak to you.
71165	eng	I would like to tell you something.
71167	eng	It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr Tamori.
71168	eng	I'm happy to see you.
71169	eng	I think he will be glad to see you.
71171	eng	I would like you to make tea for me.
71172	eng	Can I ask you a favor?
71173	eng	It is a privilege to meet you.
71174	eng	I am delighted to meet you.
71175	eng	I'm very glad to meet you.
71176	eng	It was nice to meet you, and I look forward to hearing from you.
71177	eng	I'm surprised to see you.
71179	eng	There is a woman who wants to see you.
71181	eng	We enjoyed having you as our guest.
71182	eng	How much we pay you depends on your skill.
71185	eng	I have something to give you.
71186	eng	I want you to be an Einstein.
71188	eng	I would like you to meet my parents.
71189	eng	We're confident that you are up to the challenge of the new position.
71190	eng	Since it is you, I have confidence you can solve it.
71191	eng	I just asked because I thought you would know.
71192	eng	What do you figure on this?
71193	eng	Who is it that you want to talk to?
71194	eng	There's something I need to talk with you about.
71195	eng	I look forward to corresponding with you.
71196	eng	Is there any difference between your idea and hers?
71197	eng	I am no more an artist than you are.
71198	eng	You and he are both very kind.
71199	eng	I quite agree with you.
71200	eng	Let me exchange seats with you.
71201	eng	I will discuss the question with you in detail.
71202	eng	I would like to have a word with you.
71203	eng	I make you a deal.
71204	eng	You and I must give him our present.
71205	eng	You and I are men.
71206	eng	You and I are old friends.
71207	eng	You and I are good partners in business.
71208	eng	You and I have succeeded in our attempt.
71209	eng	You and I must understand one another, and that without delay.
71210	eng	Both you and I must take care of the dog.
71211	eng	Your problem and mine are similar.
71212	eng	Between you and me, Lisa, we know that I simply don't like Nick.
71213	eng	There is no time like the time when you and I were young.
71214	eng	Do you remember the day when you and I first met?
71215	eng	It was a great privilege working with you.
71216	eng	Having worked with you was a real treat for me.
71218	eng	I enjoyed your company.
71219	eng	Who is taller, you or Ken?
71220	eng	It is no good arguing with you.
71221	eng	Never have I dreamed of marrying you.
71222	eng	I might as well marry a bird as marry you.
71223	eng	I mistook you for your brother.
71224	eng	It is useless even if I discuss with you.
71225	eng	I liked you even more when I met you.
71226	eng	I'm very pleased to come with you.
71227	eng	Had I better go with you?
71229	eng	It's a lot of fun to be with you.
71230	eng	I really enjoyed your company.
71231	eng	I'm the one who wants to be with you.
71232	eng	I enjoyed your company very much.
71233	eng	I want to make love with you.
71234	eng	I identify with you.
71235	eng	It seems that I met you somewhere.
71236	eng	I'm afraid I differ with you on this point.
71237	eng	I'd like to have a word with you.
71238	eng	I have something to talk over with you, face to face.
71239	eng	How long have you and Jane been married?
71240	eng	I'm glad for this opportunity to work with you.
71241	eng	Nice talking with you.
71242	eng	I enjoyed talking with you.
71243	eng	May I talk with you?
71244	eng	May I have a talk with you?
71245	eng	Being with you makes me feel happy.
71246	eng	I will come with you.
71247	eng	You and your friends are invited.
71248	eng	You're a life saver.
71249	eng	You're so set in your ways!
71250	eng	You're such a pack rat.
71251	eng	You're a wonderful guy.
71252	eng	How would you deal with the problem?
71253	eng	You young people have no sense of humor at all.
71254	eng	I remember seeing you all somewhere.
71255	eng	You must not look down on old people.
71256	eng	Are you students?
71257	eng	Do you walk hand in hand?
71258	eng	You are all our guests tonight.
71259	eng	You can go there in a boat.
71261	eng	You are both in the wrong.
71262	eng	Who is going to play the part in your play?
71263	eng	May you have a very happy married life!
71264	eng	Have you met each other?
71265	eng	Not only you but also he is in the wrong.
71266	eng	I imagine you're not the only one, Mr Bark.
71267	eng	You alone are my hope.
71268	eng	You are my only resort.
71269	eng	You're the only one who can help me.
71270	eng	It's OK with me if it's OK with you.
71272	eng	You are the very person I have been looking for.
71273	eng	People of your age often have this problem.
71275	eng	Who is the man that you were talking with?
71276	eng	Are you aware of the fact that you are not spoken well of?
71277	eng	I've never seen you cook. Can you cook anything at all?
71278	eng	You were seen to cook.
71279	eng	If you are to be a good world citizen, you should try to be free of any prejudices.
71281	eng	Please phone me when you have settled down.
71282	eng	She will come if you ask her.
71283	eng	I'll lend you the book, provided you return it next week.
71284	eng	I will go if you come.
71285	eng	Tell me the time when you will come.
71287	eng	I'll be so glad if you can come.
71288	eng	Let me know the days when you can come.
71289	eng	I'm glad that you'll come.
71290	eng	They were disappointed that you could not come.
71291	eng	It is a pity you cannot come.
71292	eng	I'm glad you could come. Please make yourself at home.
71293	eng	I'm glad you could come.
71294	eng	I am looking forward to meeting you when you come.
71295	eng	If you care to come, you will be welcome.
71296	eng	What was it that you wanted?
71297	eng	I'll get you whatever you want.
71298	eng	Take as many as you want.
71299	eng	Your encouragement will draw her out.
71300	eng	I can't blame you for breaking your promise.
71301	eng	Your father will lose face if you don't keep your promise.
71302	eng	May you return home safe!
71303	eng	What is it that you really want to say?
71304	eng	While you are reading to me, I can do my sewing.
71305	eng	I know that you are busy.
71306	eng	I know how busy you must be, but I need your answer to my last email before I can proceed with the project. Can you take a moment and write me back?
71307	eng	You came out of the room.
71308	eng	What was the music you were listening to?
71309	eng	Who will look after your cat while you are away?
71310	eng	If I had known about your illness, I would have visited you in the hospital.
71311	eng	It is surprising that you should know her name.
71312	eng	It was sensible of you to follow her advice.
71313	eng	I can't imagine your not knowing her address.
71314	eng	It is strange that you should know nothing about her wedding.
71315	eng	You might well ask her why she dislikes you.
71316	eng	You will do well to leave her.
71317	eng	I wouldn't object if you wanted to go with her.
71319	eng	I am surprised that you should not know of their marriage.
71320	eng	You can be sure that the money you give them will be put to good use.
71321	eng	He will be sleeping when you get to his house.
71322	eng	You can tell him for all I care.
71323	eng	It's no use your begging him for help.
71324	eng	Judging from what you have seen of him, this fellow is not a coward.
71325	eng	I will never force you to marry him.
71326	eng	For all you say about him, I still like him.
71327	eng	He will go swimming, whether you go with him or stay at home.
71328	eng	Will you show me what you bought?
71329	eng	The camera that you bought is better than mine.
71330	eng	It's your deal.
71331	eng	I'll look after the children while you go shopping.
71332	eng	If you act like a fool, you must be treated as such.
71333	eng	I will take care of you when you are old.
71334	eng	I will badly miss you if you leave Japan.
71335	eng	I thought you were Japanese.
71336	eng	While you are about it, please make a cup of coffee for me, too.
71337	eng	We will miss you terribly if you leave Japan.
71338	eng	Was he still here when you arrived?
71339	eng	Prior to your arrival, he left for London.
71341	eng	There is nothing for you to be angry about.
71342	eng	It is natural that you should get angry.
71343	eng	I was disappointed that you didn't call.
71344	eng	I was taking a bath when you called me.
71345	eng	You don't have to be discouraged because you are not a genius.
71346	eng	Read whatever books you think proper.
71347	eng	It is no use your resisting.
71348	eng	I saw you making eyes at Mr Nagashima.
71349	eng	Give up smoking if you want to live long.
71350	eng	Please visit as soon as you get into town.
71351	eng	She was astonished that you spoke Chinese so well.
71352	eng	I know that boy whom you don't know.
71353	eng	You must remember to tell him all that you know.
71354	eng	Let's look at the path that you've walked so far.
71355	eng	It's a better line than when you used to call me from the university.
71356	eng	When you dislike others, you are disliked by them in turn.
71357	eng	We are hoping for your quick recovery.
71358	eng	That you have come early is a good thing.
71359	eng	If you concentrate all your energies on the study of English, you will master the language.
71360	eng	It's all the same to me whether you will go to sea or not.
71362	eng	I'll leave a key with my next-door neighbour in case you get here before I do.
71363	eng	I don't think there is any need for you to explain.
71364	eng	Listen to those whom you think to be honest.
71365	eng	Granting that you are honest, that is no proof of your innocence.
71366	eng	It has dawned upon my mind that you are in the right.
71367	eng	By the time you land at Narita, it will be dark.
71370	eng	I am pleased at your success.
71372	eng	Is there any place you recommend?
71373	eng	Whom do you respect most in your life?
71375	eng	A woman visited us while you were sleeping.
71377	eng	Food you eat that you don't like will not be digested well.
71378	eng	He would have failed in his business but that you helped him.
71379	eng	If it had not been for your help, I should have drowned.
71380	eng	Without your help, I would have been unable to do it.
71382	eng	We will keep it for you until you leave.
71383	eng	I want to see you before you go.
71384	eng	Please be careful not to forget to lock the door when you go out.
71386	eng	Your help will save us a lot of work.
71388	eng	If you will help me, we will soon finish.
71389	eng	If you help me, I'll try it again.
71390	eng	What's the name of the man whose car you borrowed?
71391	eng	I think it is dangerous for you to drive a car.
71392	eng	It's your turn to answer the question.
71393	eng	The reason for your failure is that you did not try hard enough.
71394	eng	I was afraid that you had failed.
71395	eng	It is necessary for you to think about your life.
71396	eng	Do it yourself.
71397	eng	She will be glad if you go to see her in person.
71398	eng	If you can read the following, we can communicate in Japanese, too.
71399	eng	That you will pass the exam is certain.
71400	eng	I am pleased that you have passed the exam.
71401	eng	I'm relying on you to help us.
71402	eng	Everyone will be happy if you help us.
71403	eng	I am glad to help you whenever you need me.
71404	eng	I will accept the work, provided that you help me.
71405	eng	Do you want me to wait until you come for me?
71407	eng	You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
71408	eng	The problem has arisen simply because you didn't follow my instructions.
71409	eng	I am very grateful to you for what you've done for my family.
71410	eng	I do not expect you to subscribe to my opinion.
71411	eng	Pretend you're me.
71412	eng	I'm glad you like my present.
71413	eng	Either you or I should visit her.
71414	eng	Either you or I will have to go.
71415	eng	Either you or I will get the first prize.
71416	eng	Either you or I will have to do it.
71417	eng	Either you or I must attend the meeting.
71418	eng	I know nothing about him beyond what you told me.
71419	eng	It is kind of you to talk about it for me.
71420	eng	The magazine which you lent me is very interesting.
71421	eng	As you treat me, so will I treat you.
71422	eng	Tell me what you want me to do.
71423	eng	I'll do whatever you want me to do.
71424	eng	It is kind of you to lend me the money.
71425	eng	Either you or I am in the wrong.
71426	eng	We have no objection to your joining us in our club.
71427	eng	Either you or I am right.
71428	eng	I remember you often went to Betty's house to tea when you were a little girl.
71429	eng	When was it that you first met her?
71430	eng	What is the amount of money you spend?
71431	eng	Dinner will be ready by the time you have finished your work.
71432	eng	I'll recommend him as chairman, whether you are in favour of it or not.
71433	eng	Whether you agree or not, I cannot change my mind.
71434	eng	I'll sweep the floor while you wash the dishes.
71435	eng	Will you show me what you bought yesterday?
71436	eng	The man you saw in my office yesterday is from Belgium.
71437	eng	The man that you saw there yesterday was Mr Brown.
71438	eng	Let me read the paper when you have finished with it.
71439	eng	Here's a comfortable chair you can sit in.
71440	eng	If you are tied up now, I'll call you back later on.
71441	eng	I want to know what you did this summer.
71442	eng	It seems hard for you to see him today.
71443	eng	What you have just said reminds me of an old saying.
71444	eng	If you leave now, I'm sure you'll be caught in a traffic jam.
71445	eng	What is it that you want me to do now?
71446	eng	Who has made you what you are now?
71447	eng	I'll miss you when you're gone.
71448	eng	It makes no difference to me whether you go or not.
71449	eng	It's all the same to me whether you go or stay.
71450	eng	If you don't want to go, you don't need to.
71451	eng	We regret that you have to leave.
71452	eng	If you don't go, I will not go either.
71453	eng	You may invite whoever you like.
71454	eng	I do love you.
71455	eng	She said 'I love you' to me.
71458	eng	As you are sorry, I'll forgive you.
71459	eng	He will come if you call him.
71460	eng	I am feeling quite pleased about what you've said.
71462	eng	What you said was in the main right.
71465	eng	You say "ditto", and that's not the same as "I love you".
71467	eng	I know you are clever.
71468	eng	I can't study with you watching me.
71469	eng	It's quite natural that you should think about marriage.
71470	eng	When you get married and have kids, you'll realize that actions speak louder than words.
71472	eng	It makes no difference to me whether you are rich or poor.
71473	eng	I really look forward to your visit in the near future.
71474	eng	If you don't do your duty, people will look down on you.
71475	eng	What you were taught is wrong.
71476	eng	I received great benefit from your teaching.
71478	eng	I understand you are going to spend your vacation in New Zealand.
71481	eng	The artist, whose paintings you liked, is a friend of mine.
71482	eng	There is one important fact of which you are unaware.
71483	eng	What was your mother doing when you returned home?
71484	eng	By the time you get home, all the cherry blossoms will have fallen.
71485	eng	I'll be in bed by the time you get home.
71486	eng	There are a few points where you are mistaken.
71487	eng	Tell me the reason why you were late for school.
71488	eng	This letter arrived while you were out.
71489	eng	We often hear you sing.
71490	eng	Please look through these papers at your leisure.
71491	eng	I found your coat after you left the house.
71492	eng	Whatever you say will set her off crying.
71493	eng	No matter what you say, I am convinced that I am right.
71494	eng	I can't make out what you are trying to say.
71495	eng	Tell me what you mean.
71496	eng	I know what your game is.
71497	eng	Tell me what you are looking forward to.
71498	eng	No matter what you may say, I will not change my mind.
71499	eng	I will lend you any book that I have, so long as you keep it clean.
71500	eng	With your help, our plan would succeed.
71502	eng	It will be hard for you to speak English.
71503	eng	English will take you a long time to master.
71504	eng	The thing that you are intending to carry does not need to be carried.
71505	eng	Pick out the shirt that you like best.
71506	eng	Who is your favourite TV star?
71508	eng	I cannot consent to your going alone.
71509	eng	Let me put it in plain language you can understand.
71510	eng	It is dangerous for you to travel to a foreign country by yourself.
71511	eng	It will be late autumn when you get to London.
71512	eng	I want to split up, but I know I couldn't even if I tried.
71513	eng	I've been looking forward to hearing from you for weeks.
71514	eng	I have got a letter from you.
71515	eng	I found your letter in the mailbox.
71516	eng	I can't seem to find your last e-mail, I wonder if you can resend it to me.
71517	eng	I can't believe I misplaced the party information and registration you sent to me.
71518	eng	We are looking forward to hearing from you soon.
71519	eng	I have been hoping to hear from you.
71520	eng	We look forward to receiving your prompt reply.
71521	eng	I wonder if you received my e-mail on January 10, since I have not heard anything from you yet.
71522	eng	I will come on Wednesday evening unless I hear from you to the contrary.
71523	eng	I would like to borrow fifty dollars from you.
71524	eng	Is it the case that you have done it?
71525	eng	I think it a pity that you do not study harder.
71526	eng	If you had left earlier, you would have caught the train.
71527	eng	What would you do if you had, say, ten thousand dollars?
71528	eng	I know you must be buried in your mountain of mails, but I wonder if I can hear from you regarding the mail I sent you last week?
71529	eng	Let me see the pictures you took in Paris.
71530	eng	It is a pity that you cannot come to the party.
71531	eng	For all you say, I still believe in the truth of the theory.
71532	eng	I can not believe you, whatever reasons you may give.
71534	eng	Whichever route you take, you will get there in time.
71535	eng	I miss you so much.
71536	eng	I envy you so much.
71538	eng	No matter where you go, you will be welcomed.
71539	eng	I see why you don't want to go there.
71540	eng	When you don't know what to do, ask the host.
71541	eng	No matter who you are or where you are from, one thing is certain.
71542	eng	You should think of their religions.
71544	eng	Did you talk for a long time?
71545	eng	You are supposed to introduce yourselves in turn.
71546	eng	You were in the second year of middle school last year, right?
71547	eng	You need not be afraid of making mistakes.
71549	eng	Did you have a good time at the party?
71550	eng	I don't mind your smoking.
71551	eng	I don't agree with you smoking.
71552	eng	I'm surprised to see you smoking. You didn't used to.
71553	eng	Do you love each other very much?
71555	eng	I have spoken to you of earthy things.
71556	eng	I'm afraid your request for a pay raise was turned down again.
71557	eng	You should do all you can to help your neighbours.
71558	eng	Without your help this plan would be impossible.
71559	eng	I will try to live up to your expectations.
71560	eng	When is your school festival?
71562	eng	I'd like to join your group.
71563	eng	Which of you will try first?
71564	eng	You will save your father a lot of worry if you simply write him a letter.
71565	eng	You yourselves can testify to what I said.
71566	eng	I'm sorry that you should think that way.
71567	eng	I cannot abide hearing you cry so bitterly.
71568	eng	I wasn't aware that you were so ill.
71569	eng	It is strange that you should know that.
71570	eng	I hope you'll think better of it.
71571	eng	Whether you like it or not doesn't matter.
71572	eng	The time will come when you will regret it.
71573	eng	I hope that you will like it.
71574	eng	There is no necessity for you to do that.
71575	eng	It will cost you $100 to fly to the island.
71576	eng	I think it natural that you should take the matter into consideration.
71577	eng	I think it dangerous for you to cross the river.
71578	eng	Please tell me what you saw then.
71579	eng	It is not necessary for you to quit the job.
71580	eng	I'll wait until you finish the work.
71581	eng	How long has it been since you gave up teaching at that school?
71582	eng	It is strange that you should know nothing about the matter.
71583	eng	It will make little difference whether you go there by taxi or on foot.
71584	eng	The meeting will have broken up by the time you arrive there.
71585	eng	It's natural for you to think so.
71586	eng	Since you say so, I think I must believe it.
71587	eng	You get paid in proportion to the amount of the work you do.
71588	eng	I will do whatever you tell me to do.
71589	eng	When you said you'd look after Spot, you knew there'd be responsibilities.
71590	eng	I am glad to hear that you have got well.
71591	eng	I do hope you will come and visit us soon.
71593	eng	One of the most important things you have to do right now is to carry out the plan.
71594	eng	It is necessary that you go there at once.
71595	eng	If you don't go skiing, I won't, either.
71596	eng	You just have to do as you're told.
71597	eng	Either you or Jane has to go there.
71598	eng	I am relieved that you are safe.
71599	eng	How nice to see you up and about again so soon!
71600	eng	If you are not going to the concert, then neither am I.
71601	eng	I will help you in selecting the best from these clothes.
71602	eng	I would like to see the trees from which you picked these apples.
71603	eng	Let us know whether you can come.
71604	eng	It is worth your time to read this book.
71605	eng	I express my cordial thanks for what you have done for this city.
71606	eng	How long is it since you bought this car?
71607	eng	You'll be in charge of the women working in this factory.
71608	eng	You understand best how to use the machine.
71609	eng	What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?
71610	eng	We hope that you will be able to join us at this seminar.
71611	eng	I'm sorry you're leaving us.
71612	eng	You were fortunate to be here.
71613	eng	I don't mind your staying here.
71614	eng	Look at this old coin you have here.
71615	eng	If I had known that you were here, I would have come at once.
71616	eng	I wish you had come to see me yesterday.
71617	eng	It was wise of you to accept his offer.
71618	eng	I know you are hiding yourself behind the curtain.
71619	eng	I was disappointed when I heard that you couldn't come.
71620	eng	I'd like to see you when you are free.
71622	eng	What a pity it is that you can't come!
71623	eng	It may be unwise of you to advertise your presence.
71624	eng	It is a pity that you can not come.
71625	eng	We are glad you are coming.
71626	eng	I want to go wherever you're going.
71627	eng	I'll miss you very much if you go.
71629	eng	I'll miss you very much.
71630	eng	What a lonely world it would be with you away!
71632	eng	I'll miss you.
71633	eng	We miss you very much.
71634	eng	Tell me the reason why you want to live in the countryside.
71635	eng	Whenever you come, you will be our guest.
71636	eng	You will find a hearty welcome here whenever you call.
71637	eng	Let me know when you will arrive at the airport.
71638	eng	May you always be happy!
71639	eng	What you have said reminds me of a strange experience I had a few years ago.
71642	eng	One of the fellows you were with is a friend of mine.
71643	eng	Can you describe the situation you were in?
71646	eng	I am very happy that you have agreed to that plan.
71647	eng	If you insist on going alone, please do so.
71648	eng	I will be studying when you come at seven.
71649	eng	Please bring my book up when you come.
71650	eng	I was expecting you at 11:00 a.m.
71651	eng	You came into my room.
71652	eng	Do to others as you would have them do to you.
71654	eng	What happened to you last night?
71655	eng	Did you and Joan have a blow up?
71656	eng	The announcer can talk rapidly.
71657	eng	The announcer spoke English.
71658	eng	What do announcers do?
71659	eng	She'll be gone abroad in another six months.
71660	eng	In a few days, the baby will be able to walk.
71661	eng	Several more companies are moving to enter the lucrative pet food market of the country.
71662	eng	When will we arrive?
71663	eng	Your plan to buy another PC is out of the question.
71664	eng	We're almost there.
71665	eng	We could really use another person around here.
71666	eng	I left my address book in my room.
71667	eng	There was a bug in my Address Book and many addresses including yours were deleted.
71668	eng	Adolfo likes his new school, but really remembers his friends at his old school.
71669	eng	Thank you for the time you spent with me during my visit to Atlanta.
71670	eng	Can I get a connecting flight to Atlanta?
71671	eng	Do you think the Braves will take the series?
71672	eng	If we can just make it through one more month, we'll be sitting pretty.
71673	eng	I will tell you the rest tomorrow.
71674	eng	I'm troubled with atopic dermatitis.
71675	eng	Time will do the rest.
71676	eng	Thank you for your advice.
71677	eng	Only afterward did he explain why he did it.
71678	eng	Mr. Fuji died, leaving 4 children behind him.
71679	eng	How soon does the concert begin?
71680	eng	I'll call you later.
71681	eng	How much time do we have to finish this?
71682	eng	I'll order that later.
71683	eng	I'll come to your house later.
71684	eng	Please explain it to me later.
71685	eng	He was a kind man, as I later discovered.
71686	eng	What followed was still worse.
71687	eng	Let's check it later.
71688	eng	Please call me at my hotel later.
71689	eng	I'll call him back later.
71690	eng	Would you please come again later?
71692	eng	I had hoped to get another 50,000 miles out of my car, but it gave up the ghost on the expressway and it would cost too much to fix it.
71693	eng	I have another two letters to write.
71694	eng	Final exams are two weeks from now.
71695	eng	I have got only a week left before school starts.
71696	eng	This work will be finished in a week.
71697	eng	Christmas is a week away.
71698	eng	The new year will come in an hour.
71699	eng	I will be free in ten minutes.
71700	eng	Just stay off your feet for the next couple of weeks, and you'll be just fine.
71701	eng	I walked aimlessly about the street.
71703	eng	A cargo vessel, bound for Athens, sank in the Mediterranean without a trace.
71704	eng	I made an apple pie for you.
71705	eng	Please help yourself to some apple pie. I baked it for you.
71706	eng	It happened in a flash.
71707	eng	He disappeared in an instant.
71708	eng	Before we knew where we were, the dust storm was on us.
71709	eng	Out of my way, boy.
71710	eng	Please go away and stop annoying me.
71711	eng	Let's check that shop, too.
71712	eng	Oww! Oww! Oww! The bath water is too hot.
71713	eng	Tom may have been sick.
71714	eng	I think Mr Ashe has just got to have a cigarette.
71715	eng	Here he is!
71716	eng	The impudent child extended her legs across my lap.
71717	eng	Oh, here they come!
71718	eng	Oh, the phone's ringing. It must be Machiko.
71719	eng	Hey Taro! It sure has been a while! How're you doing?
71720	eng	There goes the bell.
71721	eng	There goes our bus.
71722	eng	Oh, no! I almost forgot!
71723	eng	I'll write you as soon as I arrive there.
71724	eng	We can see Mt. Fuji over there.
71725	eng	Please write to me when you get there.
71726	eng	I will show you around.
71727	eng	This is the man for whom I have been waiting.
71728	eng	I found holes here and there.
71729	eng	There are clumps of daisies here and there.
71730	eng	There are beautiful lakes here and there.
71731	eng	I have looked for it up and down.
71732	eng	The sun was shining all around.
71733	eng	High-rises are going up all over the place.
71734	eng	When I looked about, I found a letter on the desk.
71735	eng	I looked around, but saw nothing.
71736	eng	All is quiet.
71737	eng	There came a complete silence. You could hear a pin drop.
71738	eng	There was complete silence. You could hear a pin drop.
71739	eng	All around is silence.
71740	eng	All was calm.
71741	eng	There is nobody about.
71742	eng	I saw nobody around.
71743	eng	I observed that it had already got dark.
71744	eng	There were flowers all around.
71745	eng	It is Eve that sets Adam on.
71747	eng	Adam was furious with me when I broke his watch.
71748	eng	While Adam was rock-climbing, he fell and broke his leg.
71749	eng	Mr Adams was foolish to agree to the proposal.
71750	eng	I feel ill at ease with her.
71751	eng	I know him.
71752	eng	I don't know what to do now.
71753	eng	I will buy a watch at the store.
71754	eng	So far as I know, there is no such word.
71755	eng	As if you could kill time without injuring eternity.
71756	eng	The girl walking over there is my daughter.
71757	eng	See the boy and his dog that are running over there.
71758	eng	Fifteen years have passed since we went there last.
71759	eng	I'm afraid that place is a little too expensive.
71760	eng	That's an exclusive golf club.
71761	eng	The dealer gave an old Nissan to me for 200,000 yen.
71762	eng	That building must be on fire.
71763	eng	That place's food is great, and their prices are good, but the fly in the ointment is their terrible location.
71764	eng	Look at those empty cans there.
71765	eng	Let me treat you to a cup of coffee at the coffee shop over there.
71766	eng	Turn at that corner there.
71767	eng	There used to be a drugstore on that corner.
71768	eng	To get technical information from that company, we first have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
71770	eng	I wonder if we could have the table over there.
71771	eng	Look at the sports car over there.
71772	eng	It's at that counter.
71773	eng	What is the nationality of that cameraman over there?
71774	eng	Please show me that one in the window over there.
71775	eng	What's the nationality of that cameraman over there?
71776	eng	Who is the woman standing there?
71777	eng	Look at the tall pretty girl standing there.
71778	eng	The fellow standing over there is my friend.
71779	eng	Do you know the name of the boy standing over there?
71780	eng	The man who is standing there is my father.
71781	eng	The man standing over there is Mr Smith.
71782	eng	The man standing over there is the owner of the store.
71783	eng	The boy standing over there is my son.
71784	eng	We can see his house over there.
71785	eng	It is illegal to park a car there.
71786	eng	Can you see the big white building over there?
71787	eng	You will see a red house over there.
71788	eng	Just step right over there.
71789	eng	We see a sleeping car there.
71790	eng	The man sitting over there is a famous singer.
71791	eng	You see a tall building over there.
71792	eng	It is rumoured there are treasures hidden there.
71793	eng	That boy over there will be Tom's brother.
71794	eng	Just look at that female over there.
71795	eng	The boy over there is bowing to you.
71796	eng	It's easy to see the fireworks from over there.
71797	eng	You can ask the child who's playing over there.
71798	eng	The students studying over there are my friends.
71799	eng	Let's rent a bike there.
71800	eng	What is going on there now?
71801	eng	Look at her putting on airs over there.
71802	eng	The girl singing over there is my sister.
71803	eng	What were you doing down there?
71804	eng	They sell many types of food and grocery products.
71805	eng	You can't buy it anywhere but there.
71806	eng	That is the office where he works.
71807	eng	A form appeared from over there.
71808	eng	That's the house where Tom was born.
71809	eng	When we rush to complete our work, we make needless errors.
71810	eng	The ASEAN nations have come a long way.
71811	eng	If it should rain tomorrow, I won't play golf.
71812	eng	I have to buy one tomorrow.
71813	eng	I wonder if it will be fine tomorrow.
71814	eng	I will go to the sea if it is fine tomorrow.
71815	eng	Please remind me to write a letter tomorrow.
71816	eng	I'll call on you at your office tomorrow.
71817	eng	In case it rains tomorrow, we should make another arrangement.
71818	eng	If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home.
71819	eng	I am going to do it first thing tomorrow.
71820	eng	Take two aspirin tablets.
71821	eng	Could you send up some aspirin?
71822	eng	Aspirin has no effect on the blood pressure.
71823	eng	What does aspirin consist of?
71824	eng	I am allergic to aspirin, penicillin, and sulfa drugs.
71825	eng	I have to take an examination in history tomorrow.
71826	eng	I hope it'll be fine tomorrow.
71827	eng	It will be fine tomorrow.
71828	eng	Tomorrow never comes.
71829	eng	Let's leave tomorrow morning.
71830	eng	By tomorrow morning all the world will have been covered with snow.
71831	eng	I'll do that first thing in the morning.
71832	eng	What will you be doing at this time tomorrow?
71833	eng	It will have been raining for a week by tomorrow.
71834	eng	I am to call on Mr Smith tomorrow.
71835	eng	I will speak to you tomorrow.
71836	eng	I'll get in touch with you by phone tomorrow.
71837	eng	I'll call for you at 8 tomorrow morning.
71838	eng	I hope the weather will clear up tomorrow.
71839	eng	I have to give a testimony in the courtroom tomorrow.
71840	eng	There is no telling what will happen tomorrow.
71842	eng	I will stay home tomorrow.
71843	eng	I'll be free all day tomorrow.
71844	eng	Tomorrow is my birthday.
71845	eng	My guess is that it will be fine tomorrow.
71846	eng	What's the forecast for tomorrow?
71847	eng	Do not oversleep tomorrow morning.
71848	eng	May I be excused from tomorrow's class?
71849	eng	The assistant took the money.
71850	eng	The assistant kept $2.
71851	eng	After the assistant returned $1 to each one, each man had actually paid only $9.
71852	eng	The hydrangea blooms in June.
71853	eng	The seal kept its balance well on the large ball.
71854	eng	The imports from Asian countries have expanded recently.
71855	eng	Asia is roughly four times the size of Europe.
71856	eng	Asia is much larger than Australia.
71857	eng	I am interested in Asian history.
71858	eng	People of Asia must work together.
71859	eng	Asian religions inspire him to create splendid sculptures.
71860	eng	Many peoples live in Asia.
71861	eng	There are many people in Asia.
71862	eng	In Asia men usually precede women when walking.
71863	eng	Students from Asia studying abroad speak English too, just as Japanese students do.
71864	eng	The seals surface more frequently then, so a bear's chance of catching one at a breathing hole is greater after nightfall.
71865	eng	Being active at night may relate to the behavior of seals, which feed at night on various fish that come up closer to the surface.
71866	eng	Come the day after tomorrow.
71867	eng	I will have him come here the day after tomorrow.
71868	eng	The applicant will be coming to see you the day after tomorrow.
71869	eng	If it rains the day after tomorrow, I will stay at home.
71870	eng	The day after tomorrow is Tom's birthday.
71871	eng	Do you have time the day after tomorrow?
71872	eng	The bearded god had promised to return someday in the same way he had left.
71873	eng	The beard does not make the philosopher.
71874	eng	His beard made him look older by ten years.
71875	eng	Only in theory, the project is possible.
71876	eng	The punch on the jaw brought me to my knees.
71877	eng	He persisted in his opinion.
71878	eng	Don't do wicked things.
71879	eng	He was an American, as I knew from his accent.
71880	eng	I'm always bored with films that have little action.
71881	eng	I can tell by his accent that he is German.
71882	eng	I'm speechless.
71883	eng	Achilles was an ancient Greek hero.
71884	eng	To my dismay, he was caught cheating in the examination.
71885	eng	You may as well give up.
71886	eng	Don't give up. Stick with the job.
71887	eng	If you keep trying, you will make progress.
71888	eng	Akira is using that same dictionary that his father used as a student.
71889	eng	Akira went out for a few minutes.
71890	eng	Akira can play tennis well.
71891	eng	Akira is a good tennis player.
71892	eng	Akira is good at playing tennis.
71893	eng	Akira will stay in New York while his money lasts.
71894	eng	What does Akina have on?
71895	eng	Do you mind if I turn off the light?
71896	eng	As a light goes out, so a man dies.
71897	eng	Frankly, I don't like him.
71898	eng	Would you please refrain from smoking when babies are here?
71899	eng	If there is already an account, there is a system by which you are able to send and receive email.
71900	eng	Tyger, Tyger, burning bright.
71901	eng	I dared to support his opinion.
71902	eng	You need not take the trouble to go.
71903	eng	At the risk of sticking my neck out, I think that if we do that, we're making a big, big mistake.
71904	eng	You don't have to cancel your vacation.
71905	eng	Dare you ask me another question?
71906	eng	I will not presume to give an opinion.
71907	eng	I make a special point of avoiding that shop.
71908	eng	Before Einstein, scientists used to think that space had no end.
71909	eng	I love the outdoors, but I hate bugs.
71910	eng	Einstein was a mathematical genius.
71911	eng	Einstein was far in advance of his time.
71912	eng	Einstein loved playing the violin.
71913	eng	Einstein's theories contributed greatly to modern science.
71914	eng	Einstein's theory of relativity is Greek to me.
71915	eng	Such scientists as Einstein are rare.
71916	eng	Theoretical physics was child's play to Einstein, but he couldn't figure out his income tax.
71917	eng	We associate Einstein with the theory of relativity.
71918	eng	We associate the name of Einstein with the theory of relativity.
71919	eng	Einstein has been dead for nearly forty years.
71920	eng	I'm hopeless at ironing so I buy permanent press clothes.
71921	eng	I burned my hand with an iron.
71922	eng	The Irishman replies.
71923	eng	Ireland is famous for lace.
71924	eng	Ireland and England are separated by the sea.
71925	eng	Iris, what do you usually eat for breakfast?
71926	eng	Irene Pepperberg holds a round tray in front of a parrot she has named Alex.
71927	eng	We should put out a call for bids.
71928	eng	I'm afraid the line is busy.
71929	eng	I'm sorry, my mother's not at home.
71930	eng	I'm sorry, my father is out.
71931	eng	I'm sorry my father is out.
71932	eng	I'm afraid we don't have any left.
71933	eng	To my great disappointment, she didn't come.
71934	eng	Unfortunately he refused to come.
71935	eng	Unfortunately, the store was closed.
71936	eng	Unfortunately I hit the morning rush hour.
71937	eng	As it happened, my grandmother was not at home.
71938	eng	Unfortunately, there was no one around.
71939	eng	Unfortunately I was not in time for his speech.
71940	eng	As it happens, I have left the camera at home.
71941	eng	Unfortunately I have no money with me.
71942	eng	I don't happen to have your application on hand at the moment.
71943	eng	As it happened, my grandmother was not at home that day.
71944	eng	Unfortunately, it rained yesterday.
71945	eng	As it happens, I have no money with me now.
71946	eng	Unfortunately, it rained.
71947	eng	I picked a most unfortunate time to visit him.
71948	eng	Sorry, but he is out now.
71949	eng	I'm sorry, today is fully booked.
71950	eng	I'm sorry, but I can't accept your invitation. I have other plans on that day.
71951	eng	Unfortunately, I missed seeing the movie.
71952	eng	I'm afraid I can't accept your invitation.
71953	eng	I regret to say that the product you have asked for is currently out of stock.
71954	eng	As it happens, she is absent.
71955	eng	As it happened, I left my homework at home.
71956	eng	I'm sorry, your line is busy.
71957	eng	At the pop star's concert the fans were swarming around the foot of the stage.
71958	eng	Accepting the other's norms is submitting to the other's power.
71959	eng	Ai and Mariko are close friends. They go everywhere together.
71961	eng	There is no shortage of ideas.
71962	eng	He shot at me.
71963	eng	I wouldn't push him too far. You don't know what he might do. I'd say you can't be too careful. They say even a doomed mouse will bite a cat if he has no choice.
71964	eng	He's a different person when he's drunk, so I don't like to drink with him.
71965	eng	He shall die.
71966	eng	I will give him trouble.
71967	eng	He gives me chills.
71968	eng	They passed out.
71969	eng	The sight of him is hateful to me.
71970	eng	What fools they are!
71971	eng	I don't think they've fully adapted to the working world yet. They still seem like students.
71972	eng	They are out of hand.
71973	eng	He's not a very meticulous guy.
71974	eng	I'll take my revenge on him at all costs tomorrow.
71975	eng	Bastard hung up on me.
71976	eng	He's likely to be late so you'd better tell him again that the meeting time is seven to make double sure.
71977	eng	He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
71978	eng	She got tired of his waffling and dumped him.
71979	eng	He is really a perfect idiot.
71980	eng	He is a daredevil.
71981	eng	He's got money to burn.
71982	eng	He is too dumb to fear danger.
71983	eng	He is no better than a thief.
71984	eng	He is a shame of the town.
71985	eng	That fellow is a thorough fool.
71986	eng	Oh, he eats like a bird.
71987	eng	That fellow can't tell right from wrong.
71988	eng	He was the cock of the walk.
71989	eng	He is a formidable opponent.
71990	eng	He is a spoiled child.
71991	eng	Watch out for him. That guy can really hold a grudge.
71992	eng	He is so heartless.
71993	eng	He is a poet or something.
71994	eng	They say fine words are no virtue if they're insincere and that's him in a nutshell. He's all talk but doesn't mean a word of it.
71995	eng	He has a sharp tongue.
71996	eng	He has a smooth tongue.
71997	eng	Don't tell him. He's got a loose tongue.
71998	eng	He is nasty.
72000	eng	He is a tough customer.
72001	eng	He has more lives than a cat.
72002	eng	All those tricks he's got up his sleeve make him a formidable client.
72003	eng	He is a self-willed fellow.
72005	eng	He has an evil countenance.
72006	eng	He should have worked harder.
72007	eng	He is a hard boiled egg.
72008	eng	What an oddball he is!
72009	eng	He is busy loafing on the job.
72010	eng	He is no ordinary man.
72011	eng	He is very mercenary.
72012	eng	That fellow is a cool hand.
72013	eng	That man is notorious as a gambler.
72014	eng	He is the dumbest kid in the class.
72015	eng	He's a car nut. Ask him anything.
72016	eng	That guy is always asking his parents for money.
72017	eng	He is complaining about something or other all the time.
72018	eng	Who the devil was that?
72019	eng	He's a big show-off when girls are around.
72020	eng	That guy really burns me up.
72021	eng	He is a good joker.
72022	eng	Finally, he lost his temper.
72023	eng	He's a goner.
72024	eng	I find just the memory of his overly polite patronizing manner really offensive.
72025	eng	His talk bores me to death.
72026	eng	I gave him a stern talking to.
72027	eng	His little sister is very cute, isn't she?
72028	eng	It constantly appalls me how stupid he can be.
72029	eng	I'll put his courage to the test.
72030	eng	He is a jack-of-all-trades.
72031	eng	I have to cover his loss.
72032	eng	I'll kill him.
72033	eng	I don't like his smart way of talking.
72034	eng	I have had quite enough of his jokes.
72035	eng	I don't live in his pocket.
72036	eng	You don't have to listen to what he says.
72037	eng	Don't take any notice of what he says.
72038	eng	Nobody likes him, because he is always blowing his own horn.
72039	eng	I'll bewitch him into a frog!
72040	eng	You can trust him with any job.
72041	eng	He made up a pretext for a fight with me.
72042	eng	I was deceived by him.
72043	eng	I'm up to here with him!
