68114	eng	That man is too boastful for my liking.
68115	eng	He is far from suitable for that job.
68116	eng	Will he be able to come tomorrow?
68117	eng	Don't worry. He may look intimidating at first glance, but he's actually a very friendly person.
68118	eng	He had the impudence to cut across our garden.
68119	eng	Her daughter is bad at cooking.
68120	eng	I was distrustful of his motives.
68121	eng	I can't hold up my head before him.
68122	eng	Although the man's ideas are sound, because he can't express them well, he doesn't have a ghost of a chance of getting them accepted.
68123	eng	I cannot place confidence in his words.
68124	eng	Something in his face really reminded me of an old boyfriend of mine.
68125	eng	His singing outdoes a professional.
68126	eng	His house is near the subway.
68127	eng	His wife speaks Spanish as well as English.
68128	eng	People notice every move he makes.
68129	eng	He is not much to look at, I guess.
68130	eng	Shall I buy some for him?
68131	eng	Let's ask him.
68132	eng	I'm not about to ask him.
68133	eng	I'm rather hesitant about asking him a favor.
68134	eng	Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
68135	eng	He has knowledge, and experience as well.
68136	eng	I remember meeting that man at Cambridge before.
68138	eng	I am too amazed at him to say anything.
68139	eng	I haven't met him properly yet.
68140	eng	It will be rather difficult for him.
68141	eng	There were some unsavory rumors about him.
68142	eng	I suggest that you should write him a thank-you letter.
68143	eng	I am sick and tired of him.
68144	eng	It's easy for that man to compose a good poem.
68145	eng	You're better off not getting in his way!
68147	eng	Our meeting like that is probably the kind of thing that only happens once.
68148	eng	Every time you go out with him, it seems to rain. So we call him the rain man.
68149	eng	Don't get mixed up with those people.
68150	eng	Are you acquainted with the man?
68151	eng	He's so moody I have trouble keeping up with him.
68152	eng	He's the type who doesn't worry about details.
68153	eng	Those men are of a generation.
68155	eng	I often go fishing with them.
68156	eng	I wonder who they are.
68157	eng	They say that I'm an old woman.
68158	eng	They live in the house opposite to ours.
68159	eng	They are just going to the store over there.
68160	eng	They must have been overcome by the recent disasters.
68161	eng	Their baby is able to walk already.
68162	eng	Their hut is situated in the valley.
68163	eng	Their trouble stems from a trifling matter.
68164	eng	I wanted to show them my appreciation.
68165	eng	Will you help me give out the programs to those people?
1260470	fra	Quand penses-tu qu'il sera de retour ?
68167	eng	I feel uncomfortable with those people.
68168	eng	May they live long!
68169	eng	Are those the people you saw yesterday?
68170	eng	While they were away on holiday, their neighbours looked after the dog.
68171	eng	As soon as they return, I will telephone you.
68172	eng	I hope neither of them was injured in the crash.
68173	eng	I don't know who that man is.
68174	eng	I don't know who the man is.
68175	eng	No one informed me of his failure.
68176	eng	He cannot be a poet.
68177	eng	He is directly above me.
68179	eng	How long is it since you heard from him?
68180	eng	What happened to him?
68181	eng	I think it strange that he should lose his temper over that.
68182	eng	He reminds me of his father when he speaks.
68183	eng	Without him our company would cease to function.
68184	eng	That is the American about whom we talked yesterday.
68185	eng	I heard she brushed him off, saying "Let's just be friends."
68186	eng	That guy always goes over people's heads to get what he wants.
68187	eng	Who is that gentleman?
68188	eng	How hard he works!
68189	eng	That gentleman must be a doctor.
68190	eng	How did you come to know that gentleman?
68191	eng	That new company could flatten the competition.
68192	eng	That new movie was a bummer.
68193	eng	The food is sensational at that new restaurant.
68194	eng	Please let me off on this side of that traffic light.
68195	eng	I was at a loss what to do on that occasion.
68196	eng	That castle is beautiful.
68197	eng	That castle was built in ancient times.
68198	eng	The star which shines up there is Jupiter.
68199	eng	That boy is his brother.
68200	eng	That boy has good brains.
68202	eng	The young boy got sticky fingers when he walked into stores.

68204	eng	The boy tried moving the heavy sofa.
68205	eng	That boy has black hair.
68206	eng	The young man is a handsome figure.
68207	eng	That boy is speaking English.
68208	eng	That boy often breaks our windows with a ball.
68209	eng	Is that boy Tom or Ben?
68210	eng	That boy is Tony, isn't he?
68211	eng	The boy seems to be coming in this direction.
68212	eng	That boy hit her child on purpose.
68213	eng	That boy's name is Shintaro Wada.
68214	eng	That boy's hair is black.
68215	eng	Those boys are in the first flush of youth.
68216	eng	How lazy those boys are!
68217	eng	Those boys are not good at speaking to these girls.
68218	eng	That girl is certainly a hard worker.
68219	eng	That girl is more cute than beautiful.
68220	eng	Who's that girl?
68221	eng	That girl is under the delusion that she is a princess.
68222	eng	That girl's eyes are blue.
68223	eng	The small retail outlet is only a front for a much larger entity.
68224	eng	That path is apt to be muddy after rain.
68225	eng	That novel was widely read.
68226	eng	That primary school has a strong soccer team.
68227	eng	That hut is crawling with lizards and insects.
68228	eng	That small star is brightest.
68229	eng	That little girl is my sister's friend.
68230	eng	That small one is also mine.
68231	eng	I'd still be spinning my wheels if I hadn't gotten that scholarship.
68232	eng	The merchant deals in silk goods.
68233	eng	That actress is as beautiful as ever.
68234	eng	I think that actress is one of the most beautiful women on earth.
68235	eng	That actress is the shining star in the company.
68236	eng	That woman is proud rather than vain.
68238	eng	Who is that woman?
68239	eng	The lady really flipped out when she learned she had won a million dollars.
68240	eng	The woman served her purpose.
68241	eng	She is quite coquettish.
68242	eng	She came damn late.
68244	eng	She is always finding fault with other people.
68245	eng	That woman is much older than I.
68246	eng	That woman will be his wife.
68247	eng	That woman has two bags.
68248	eng	Look at the girls.
68249	eng	The young woman didn't know her boyfriend was loaded.
68250	eng	That girl is arrogant because of her beauty.
68251	eng	That girl is far from being shy.
68252	eng	I wonder who that girl is.
68253	eng	That girl is a true blue country singer.
68254	eng	The young girl wanted to be a star of the silver screen.
68255	eng	How sad that girl looks!
68256	eng	That girl looks very pretty.
68257	eng	The girl had grown up without any money and when she married she became a spendthrift.
68258	eng	Which of those girls do you like?
68259	eng	Are you interested in that girl?
68260	eng	The girl may well think ill you.
68261	eng	How that woman runs on!
68262	eng	She is no beauty.
68263	eng	You don't have to be very old to remember that event.
68264	eng	That publishing company is in the black.
68265	eng	Can you manage to carry that heavy suitcase by yourself?
68266	eng	That religious cult has got some pretty off the wall ideas.
68267	eng	That kind of dress is now in fashion.
68268	eng	Those young men are independent of their parents.
68269	eng	That young man is very keen on cycling.
68270	eng	That young man is our teacher.
68271	eng	The agent built up the young singer.
68272	eng	Are you going to buy that auto?
68273	eng	Follow the car.
68274	eng	That car is hers.
68275	eng	That car is a real beauty.
68276	eng	That car is mine.
68277	eng	That car is too expensive for me to buy.
68278	eng	That car is the best deal for your money.
68279	eng	You seem to have had that car for years.
68281	eng	That car is the most beautiful of the three.
68282	eng	That car salesman was a pretty off the wall kind of guy.
68283	eng	That president's secretary is always prim.
68284	eng	The president is difficult to approach.
68285	eng	There was a problem with the architecture of that company's new computer. They're going through a recall frenzy right now.
68286	eng	Please take a look at that picture.
68287	eng	Where's that picture hiding?
68288	eng	That copy differs from the original.
68289	eng	I never see that play without crying.
68290	eng	That bicycle belongs to our school.
68291	eng	The chances of success are greater if the business man knows the ropes, and also has more funds at his disposal.
68292	eng	The price of that bicycle was too high.
68293	eng	I wish I had been kind to her then.
68294	eng	I wish I had obeyed his directions.
68295	eng	I was reading a novel then.
68296	eng	If he had taken my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
68298	eng	At the time I managed to make myself understood in English.
68299	eng	That clock is one minute fast.
68300	eng	I wish I had been with you then.
68301	eng	I have not seen him since.
68302	eng	If he had worked hard at that time, he would have succeeded.
68303	eng	You know, I had a lot of fun.
68304	eng	Were you sober at that time?
68305	eng	I cannot express how pleased I was then.
68306	eng	I wish I had treated the girl more kindly at that time.
68307	eng	If she had married you, she would be happy now.
68308	eng	His health has declined since the accident.
68309	eng	That accident brought home to me the power of nature.
68310	eng	That accident is a good illustration of his carelessness.
68311	eng	She was never completely free from pain after the accident.
68312	eng	There is something mysterious about the accident.
68313	eng	Do you know what time that accident happened?
68314	eng	Who will hear the case?
68315	eng	That incident was a black mark against the president.
68316	eng	That incident is printed on my mind.
68317	eng	That branch is affiliated to the miners' union.
68318	eng	The children thought that their parents were made of money.
68319	eng	The child captivates everyone with his sunny smile.
68320	eng	The child came near being drowned.
68321	eng	Those children use bad words.
68322	eng	Those children are waiting for their mother.
68323	eng	I'm against us forcing the child to go to cram school.
68324	eng	You shouldn't indulge that child. It will make him very selfish.
68325	eng	He will soon be past playing with toys.
68326	eng	That child is full of mischief.
68327	eng	He is a slim child.
68328	eng	She was named Kate after her mother.
68329	eng	He is very mean to me.
68330	eng	The boy isn't as bad as he seemed.
68331	eng	I wonder what ever will become of the child.
68332	eng	The boy often runs errands.
68333	eng	The kid looks blank.
68334	eng	What a little imp he is!
68335	eng	What a nuisance that child is!
68336	eng	That boy is a handful.
68337	eng	That child is impossible.
68338	eng	She is always smiling.
68339	eng	That child is always fretting.
68340	eng	The child is dirty.
68341	eng	That child can count to twenty.
68342	eng	You have to allow for the boy's age.
68343	eng	The mother of that child is an announcer.
68344	eng	That child is a headache.
68345	eng	The child puts adults to shame.
68346	eng	That girl just drives me wild.
68347	eng	The kid is a pain in the neck.
68348	eng	That boy of mine! He'll eat me out of house and home!
68349	eng	What were you doing when she came?
68350	eng	If that boy had not been killed in the traffic accident, he would be a college student now.
68351	eng	That child's constant screaming gives me gray hairs.
68352	eng	I think that girl cut her hair to give herself a new look.
68353	eng	How well that girl skis!
68354	eng	The sisters are quite unlike.
68355	eng	I did that work on the orders of my boss.
68356	eng	The job offer still stands.
68357	eng	What's the name of the mountain range?
68358	eng	Look at that mountain.
68359	eng	That mountain is covered with snow.
68360	eng	The mountain used to send out clouds of smoke.
68361	eng	That mountain is in the clouds.
68362	eng	How high mountain that is!

68364	eng	That mountain is five times as high as this one.
68365	eng	That mountain is about three thousand meters high.
68366	eng	The top of that mountain is flat.
338301	deu	Ich gebe zu, dass dies vielleicht nicht der beste Weg ist, es zu tun.
68368	eng	It is dangerous to climb that mountain.
68369	eng	You need good equipment to climb that mountain.
68370	eng	We are going to climb that mountain.
68371	eng	Are you done with that magazine?
68372	eng	I found nothing interesting in that magazine.
68373	eng	I cannot put up with all that noise.
68374	eng	The writer has an excellent style.
68375	eng	Six months have passed since the author was killed in an accident.
68376	eng	The confidence man and his blonde call girl make a perfect match in enraging his landlady.
68377	eng	If only I had listened to my parents!
68378	eng	There was hatred between us then.
68379	eng	We were younger then.
68380	eng	Look at those black clouds.
68381	eng	Who is the gentleman all dressed in black?

68395	eng	That high mountain is Mt. Tsukuba.
68396	eng	Look at that tall building.
68398	eng	What's that tall building?
68399	eng	There is a library at the back of that tall building.
68400	eng	It's heart-warming to see that happy old couple.
68401	eng	They make used cooking oil into soap at that factory.
68402	eng	That candidate stands for free trade.
68403	eng	What happened at that crossing?
68404	eng	That fox must have killed the hen.
68405	eng	That lake looks like the sea.
68406	eng	Cut down that dead tree, or it will fall down on your house.
68408	eng	That old book is a real find.
68409	eng	That ancient ruin was once a shrine.
68410	eng	Those old laws were all done away with.
68411	eng	That old bridge is anything but safe.
68412	eng	That old house is thought to be haunted.
68413	eng	They say that old house is haunted.
68414	eng	Where did you pick up those old coins?
68415	eng	For a healthy cheerful guy like that to get sick is like the devil getting sunstroke. Everyone is talking about it.
68416	eng	That dog is too dangerous to be left loose.
68417	eng	Don't let that dog come near me!
68418	eng	How fast that dog runs!
68419	eng	You should do away with that dog.
68420	eng	How old that dog is!
68421	eng	That dog runs very fast.
68422	eng	That dog has a short tail.
68423	eng	That dog is exactly twice the size of this one.
68424	eng	Is that dog male or female?
68425	eng	How old is that dog?
68426	eng	I was bitten in the leg by that dog.
68427	eng	Keep away from the dog.
68428	eng	How can we get the ball away from the dog?
68429	eng	That dog has been barking 'Ruff-ruff-ruff-ruff!' all day long.
68430	eng	Look at that building. Is it a temple?
68431	eng	Look at that building.
68432	eng	That building is our school.
68433	eng	What's that building?
68434	eng	Who is the man standing in front of the building?
68435	eng	Please let me off in front of that building.
68436	eng	That architect builds very modern houses.
68437	eng	The matter has not been settled yet.

68444	eng	Those shoes do not go with the suit.
68445	eng	That bank was held up twice.
68446	eng	The bank was held up a week ago.
68447	eng	He says he's related to that rich family.

68480	eng	The student is likely to do well on this coming mid-term exam.
68481	eng	That student is very active.
68482	eng	Those students work hard, don't they?

68508	eng	That company puts out a magazine, doesn't it?
68509	eng	Everybody in that company is either a vice-president or a senior vice-president; they're all chiefs and no Indians.
68510	eng	That company hires people without regard to race, religion, or nationality.
68511	eng	The people in the office will never agree.
68512	eng	The president of that company has an ace up her sleeve.
68513	eng	The price of the stock of that company will not come down.
68514	eng	I'm not satisfied with that company's service.
68515	eng	Our transactions with that firm have continued unbroken since my father's generation.
68516	eng	A contract with that company is worth next to nothing.
68517	eng	That flower smells sweet.

68526	eng	That song's bound to be a hit.
68527	eng	That song is very popular with young people.
68528	eng	I like the slow rhythm of that song.

71765	eng	Let me treat you to a cup of coffee at the coffee shop over there.
71766	eng	Turn at that corner there.
