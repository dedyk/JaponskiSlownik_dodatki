6411765	eng	I wonder if Mary really wants us to do that for her.
6411766	eng	I wonder if Mary really needs us to do that for her.
6411767	eng	I wasn't the one who told Mary she couldn't do that.
6411768	eng	I was the one who told Mary that she should do that.
6411769	eng	I was the one who told Mary that she had to do that.
6411770	eng	I was surprised when Mary said she was unhappy here.
6411771	eng	I wanted to ask Mary why she'd never gotten married.
6411772	eng	I waited for Mary all afternoon, but she never came.
6411773	eng	I told Mary that she should try to do it by herself.
6411774	eng	I told Mary that I'd buy her another skateboard.
6411775	eng	I told Mary not to do that the way she was doing it.
6411776	eng	I told Mary I wouldn't do that unless she helped me.
6411777	eng	I told Mary I wanted her to teach me how to do that.
6411778	eng	I told Mary I could do whatever she wanted me to do.
6411779	eng	I thought Mary wouldn't enjoy doing that by herself.
6411780	eng	I thought Mary would apologize to me, but she didn't
6411781	eng	I thought Mary said she wasn't going to get married.
6411782	eng	I thought Mary said she didn't know how to get here.
6411783	eng	I think you should tell Mary why you don't like her.
6411784	eng	I think you should tell Mary what she wants to know.
6411785	eng	I think we should tell Mary that she has to do that.
6411786	eng	I think one of us ought to ask Mary what she thinks.
6411787	eng	I think Mary would've stayed longer if she could've.
6411788	eng	I think Mary would've helped us if she'd been there.
6411789	eng	I think Mary won't be as mad as you think she'll be.
6411790	eng	I think Mary might get hurt if she tries to do that.
6411791	eng	I think Mary may be able to do that if you help her.
6411792	eng	I think Mary isn't sure that's what she needs to do.
6411793	eng	I think Mary has already done what she needed to do.
6411794	eng	I think Mary could get hurt if she tries to do that.
6411795	eng	I think Mary could do that for Tom if she wanted to.
6411796	eng	I suppose Mary might not do what we asked her to do.
6411797	eng	I should've asked Mary why she didn't leave earlier.
6411798	eng	I should tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that.
6411799	eng	I should tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that.
6411800	eng	I should probably tell Mary that she has to do that.
6411801	eng	I offered Mary a drink of vodka, but she refused it.
6411802	eng	I never told Mary I wanted to go to Boston with her.
6411803	eng	I never even got a chance to ask Mary if she'd help.
6411804	eng	I need to talk to Mary about what she said she'd do.
6411805	eng	I know Mary didn't do that when she was supposed to.
6411806	eng	I intend to phone Mary tomorrow and ask her to help.
6411807	eng	I hope that Mary likes the present I bought for her.
6411808	eng	I heard Mary bragging about how much money she made.
6411809	eng	I haven't heard from Mary since she moved to Boston.
6411810	eng	I forgot to tell Mary to take her umbrella with her.
6411811	eng	I expect that Mary won't do what you want her to do.
6411812	eng	I doubt that Mary will be punished for what she did.
6411813	eng	I don't think that Mary did her homework by herself.
6411814	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom wants her to leave.
6411815	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she's going to do yet.
6411816	eng	I don't think Mary knows what Tom expects her to do.
6411817	eng	I don't think Mary knows she shouldn't do that here.
6411818	eng	I don't think Mary knows exactly what she should do.
6411819	eng	I don't think Mary knows exactly what she has to do.
6411820	eng	I don't know Mary well enough to ask her to do that.
6411821	eng	I didn't want to bother Mary while she was studying.
6411822	eng	I didn't think Mary would be exhausted, but she was.
6411823	eng	I didn't tell Mary anything she didn't already know.
6411824	eng	I didn't let Mary finish what she was trying to say.
6411825	eng	I didn't know Mary would have to do that on her own.
6411826	eng	I didn't know Mary would have to do that by herself.
6411827	eng	I bet Mary thirty dollars that she couldn't do that.
6411828	eng	I asked Mary why she wasn't at the party last night.
6411829	eng	I asked Mary to come yesterday, but she didn't come.
6411830	eng	I asked Mary if she wanted to go to a movie with me.
6411831	eng	I almost told Mary what you told me not to tell her.
6411832	eng	How did Mary talk Tom into babysitting her children?
6411833	eng	How did Mary know she was supposed to be here today?
6411834	eng	Does Mary really think she can take care of herself?
6411835	eng	Do you think Mary would like me to help her do that?
6411836	eng	Do you have any pictures of Mary when she was a kid?
6411837	eng	Did Mary say she thought she didn't need to do that?
6411838	eng	Did Mary say she thought she didn't have to do that?
6411839	eng	Did Mary know that she was doing that the wrong way?
6411840	eng	As a matter of fact, Mary didn't do that by herself.
6411841	eng	You should've told Mary that she needed to do that.
6411842	eng	Who did Mary think would want to go there with her?
6411843	eng	When Mary was in kindergarten, she lived in Boston.
6411844	eng	When Mary gets back, tell her to come to my office.
6411845	eng	When Mary first told me that, I didn't believe her.
6411846	eng	What makes you think Mary can take care of herself?
6411847	eng	What happened to Mary? I haven't seen her recently.
6411848	eng	We need to make sure Mary has everything she needs.
6411849	eng	We have to get Mary someplace where she'll be safe.
6411850	eng	We have no plans to replace Mary after she retires.
6411851	eng	Was it you who told Mary she shouldn't leave early?
6411852	eng	There were a lot of things Mary said she had to do.
6411853	eng	The police handcuffed Mary and read her her rights.
6411854	eng	Sometimes Mary does that and sometimes she doesn't.
6411855	eng	Since Mary is sick, I'm sure she won't go swimming.
6411856	eng	Please tell Mary she needs to get home before 2:30.
6411857	eng	Please tell Mary she doesn't need to do that today.
6411858	eng	Please tell Mary she doesn't have to do that today.
6411859	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know she's got to do that today.
6411860	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know she shouldn't do that here.
6411861	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know exactly what she should do.
6411862	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know exactly what she has to do.
6411863	eng	Mary's parents let her do whatever she wants to do.
6411864	eng	Mary's parents let her do anything she wants to do.
6411865	eng	Mary's father doesn't allow her to go out at night.
6411866	eng	Mary's doctor suggested that she cut down on sugar.
6411867	eng	Mary's doctor advised her not to eat between meals.
6411868	eng	Mary writes everything down so she won't forget it.
6411869	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me who she was planning to meet.
6411870	eng	Mary wouldn't have done that if she didn't have to.
6411871	eng	Mary wouldn't be happy if we forced her to do that.
6411872	eng	Mary would've done that if she'd had the chance to.
6411873	eng	Mary would've done that herself if she'd known how.
6411874	eng	Mary would've done that by herself if she could've.
6411875	eng	Mary wondered why she'd never seen Tom here before.
6411876	eng	Mary wondered where Tom wanted her to park the car.
6411877	eng	Mary wondered what to do with the wallet she found.
6411878	eng	Mary won't have to do anything she doesn't want to.
6411879	eng	Mary won't go to sleep unless you read her a story.
6411880	eng	Mary won't be able to solve the problem by herself.
6411881	eng	Mary won't be able to do that unless Tom helps her.
6411882	eng	Mary woke up a little eelier than she usually does.
6411883	eng	Mary will very likely be punished for what she did.
6411884	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom why she had to do that.
6411885	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom that she can't do that.
6411886	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she'll never leave him.
6411887	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she intends to do that.
6411888	eng	Mary will probably finish what she's doing by 2:30.
6411889	eng	Mary will need at least $300 to buy what she needs.
6411890	eng	Mary will likely be very hungry when she gets home.
6411891	eng	Mary went out drinking with her friends last night.
6411892	eng	Mary wasn't willing to do what we wanted her to do.
6411893	eng	Mary wasn't willing to do what Tom asked her to do.

6412086	eng	Mary said she's going to attend tomorrow's meeting.
6412087	eng	Mary said she's glad you were able to go yesterday.
6412088	eng	Mary said she'll do that for you if you ask her to.
6412089	eng	Mary said she'd try to do that as soon as possible.

6412103	eng	Mary said she was going to go to Boston to see Tom.
6412104	eng	Mary said she wanted to buy one of Tom's paintings.
6412105	eng	Mary said she wanted to ask me a personal question.
6412106	eng	Mary said she wanted me to show her how to do that.
6412107	eng	Mary said she thought you wouldn't want to do that.
6412108	eng	Mary said she thought we'd need to wait until 2:30.
6412109	eng	Mary said she thought that would likely not happen.
6412110	eng	Mary said she thought she was too drunk to do that.
6412111	eng	Mary said she thought she knew what had to be done.

6412117	eng	Mary said she thought Tom would be willing to wait.
6412118	eng	Mary said she thought Tom would be glad to see her.
6412119	eng	Mary said she thought Tom would be able to do that.
6412120	eng	Mary said she thought Tom was in his room studying.
6412121	eng	Mary said she thought Tom was in his room sleeping.
6412122	eng	Mary said she thought Tom needed to get more sleep.
6412123	eng	Mary said she thought Tom might be able to do that.
6412124	eng	Mary said she thought I might have to do that soon.
6412125	eng	Mary said she saw Tom spanking one of his children.
6412126	eng	Mary said she saw Tom and Alice kissing each other.

6412149	eng	Mary said she didn't want to eat leftovers anymore.
6412150	eng	Mary said she didn't want Tom to come to her party.
6412151	eng	Mary said she didn't think we should be doing that.
6412152	eng	Mary said she didn't think she should say anything.
6412153	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom would let her drive.
6412154	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom should've done that.
6412155	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom knew how to do that.
6412156	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom did that very often.
6412157	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom did that on purpose.
6412158	eng	Mary said she didn't really care if she won or not.
6412159	eng	Mary said she didn't know why Tom wouldn't do that.

6412178	eng	Mary said her father told her not to do that again.
6412179	eng	Mary said Tom would probably go to Boston with her.
6412180	eng	Mary said Tom wasn't as mad as she thought he'd be.
6412181	eng	Mary said Tom knew she might be allowed to do that.
6412182	eng	Mary refused to do what Tom told her she had to do.
6412183	eng	Mary really doesn't want to tell Tom where she was.
6412184	eng	Mary read a book while she was waiting for the bus.
6412185	eng	Mary put the first aid kit back where she found it.

6412191	eng	Mary promised Tom that she'd come home early today.
6412192	eng	Mary promised Tom she'd help him with his homework.
6412193	eng	Mary probably won't be able to get home by herself.
6412194	eng	Mary probably shouldn't tell Tom that she did that.
6412195	eng	Mary probably doesn't know why Tom is ignoring her.
6412196	eng	Mary probably doesn't know who's going to help her.
6412197	eng	Mary pretended that she didn't hear Tom's question.
6412198	eng	Mary planned to visit Tom the first chance she got.
6412199	eng	Mary ordered beer for herself and red wine for Tom.
6412200	eng	Mary often drank chocolate milk when she was a kid.
6412201	eng	Mary may not be as busy today as she was yesterday.

6412203	eng	Mary may forget to do that if you don't remind her.

6412206	eng	Mary made it clear that she didn't want to help us.
6412207	eng	Mary made it clear that she didn't want to do that.
6412208	eng	Mary made it clear that she didn't want to be here.
6412209	eng	Mary looked like she wasn't in a hurry to get home.
6412210	eng	Mary locked herself in her room and won't come out.
6412211	eng	Mary likes to listen to music while she's studying.
6412212	eng	Mary lied to Tom when she said she didn't love him.
6412213	eng	Mary learned French while she was living in Boston.
6412214	eng	Mary laughed before she realized Tom wasn't joking.
6412215	eng	Mary knows she shouldn't try doing that by herself.
6412216	eng	Mary knew that she'd be able to do that eventually.
6412217	eng	Mary knew that Tom didn't want to be seen with her.
6412218	eng	Mary knew she might not need to do that by herself.
6412219	eng	Mary knew she might not have to do that by herself.
6412220	eng	Mary knew more about what happened than she let on.
6412221	eng	Mary just found out that she has to move to Boston.
6412222	eng	Mary isn't yet quite sure what she should be doing.
6412223	eng	Mary isn't willing to do that unless Tom helps her.
6412224	eng	Mary isn't really sure why she has to go to Boston.
6412225	eng	Mary isn't likely to permit Tom to do that for her.
6412226	eng	Mary isn't as tempted to do that as she used to be.
6412227	eng	Mary isn't actually going to do that today, is she?
6412228	eng	Mary is worried that something might happen to her.
6412229	eng	Mary is saving up money so she can go to Australia.
6412230	eng	Mary is never going to find what she's looking for.

6412241	eng	Mary is always getting people to do things for her.
6412242	eng	Mary is afraid that she's about to lose everything.
6412243	eng	Mary hired Tom to work at her store on Park Street.

6412245	eng	Mary hasn't yet told Tom what she's supposed to do.
6412246	eng	Mary hasn't told Tom what she's supposed to do yet.
6412247	eng	Mary hasn't been talking very good care of herself.
6412248	eng	Mary hasn't been doing that as often as she should.
6412249	eng	Mary has told me she has to go to Boston next week.
6412250	eng	Mary has told Tom that she doesn't need to do that.
6412251	eng	Mary has told Tom that she doesn't have to do that.

6412260	eng	Mary had enough money to buy everything she wanted.

6412267	eng	Mary enjoyed the time she spent in Boston with Tom.
6412268	eng	Mary ended up taking the job that they offered her.
6412269	eng	Mary drank the whole bottle of wine all by herself.
6412270	eng	Mary drank a lot of coffee so she could stay awake.
6412271	deu	Sonst hat Tom Maria jeden Morgen einen Abschiedskuss gegeben, doch nun gibt er ihr keinen mehr.
6412272	eng	Mary doubts if Tom will come to her birthday party.
6412273	eng	Mary doesn't want to do that and I don't blame her.
6412274	eng	Mary doesn't want to admit how much she misses Tom.
6412275	eng	Mary doesn't trust anybody else to do that for her.
6412276	eng	Mary doesn't think Tom would permit her to do that.
6412277	eng	Mary doesn't think Tom will be doing that with her.
6412278	eng	Mary doesn't seem to know what she's talking about.
6412279	eng	Mary doesn't seem to be enjoying herself very much.
6412280	eng	Mary doesn't really think we can do that, does she?
6412281	eng	Mary doesn't play tennis as often as she'd like to.
6412282	eng	Mary doesn't like it when Tom kisses her in public.

6412290	eng	Mary didn't want to do that, but she had no choice.
6412291	eng	Mary didn't want to come here, but she came anyway.
6412292	eng	Mary didn't wake me up at 6:30 like I asked her to.
6412293	eng	Mary didn't understand what she was supposed to do.
6412294	eng	Mary didn't think she'd ever get used to Thai food.

6412313	eng	Mary didn't know how long she was supposed to wait.
6412314	eng	Mary didn't know how long Tom expected her to wait.
6412315	eng	Mary didn't know Tom thought she shouldn't do that.
6412316	eng	Mary didn't have to go there if she didn't want to.
6412317	eng	Mary didn't have to eat that if she didn't want to.

6412319	eng	Mary didn't have a dog the last time I visited her.
6412320	eng	Mary didn't have a bicycle when she was growing up.
6412321	eng	Mary didn't feel well, but she went to work anyway.

6412324	eng	Mary didn't do that as well as I thought she would.
6412325	eng	Mary didn't do that as soon as I thought she would.
6412326	eng	Mary didn't do that as quickly as she usually does.
6412327	eng	Mary didn't deny that she was the one who did that.
6412328	eng	Mary did everything she possibly could to help Tom.
6412329	eng	Mary denied that she was the one who had done that.
6412330	eng	Mary decided that she'd never try doing that again.

6412336	eng	Mary couldn't get the tickets you asked her to buy.
6412337	eng	Mary couldn't get Tom to tell her his phone number.
6412338	eng	Mary couldn't afford to buy the bicycle she wanted.
6412339	eng	Mary could've stayed home today if she'd wanted to.
6412340	eng	Mary could've done that for Tom if she'd wanted to.
6412341	eng	Mary confessed that she'd eaten all of the cookies.
6412342	eng	Mary climbed up the ladder as quickly as she could.
6412343	eng	Mary certainly isn't as smart as Tom thinks she is.
6412344	eng	Mary can't play tennis as well as she says she can.
6412345	eng	Mary can't forgive herself for what she did to Tom.
6412346	eng	Mary can't be in Boston. I just saw her in Chicago.
6412347	eng	Mary can stay here a little longer if she wants to.
6412348	eng	Mary called to say she wasn't coming to work today.
6412349	eng	Mary called me to tell me that she has a flat tire.
6412350	eng	Mary bet Tom thirty dollars that she could do that.
6412351	eng	Mary began skating when she was thirteen years old.
6412352	eng	Mary began playing the drums when she was thirteen.
6412353	eng	Mary assured Tom that she wouldn't do that anymore.
6412354	eng	Mary asks me the same thing every time she sees me.
6412355	eng	Mary asked me to help her with her French homework.
6412356	eng	Mary asked me if I wanted to go to Boston with her.
6412357	eng	Mary asked if she really had to do that by herself.
6412358	eng	Mary asked Tom to meet her at John's house at 2:30.
6412359	eng	Mary asked Tom to help decorate her Christmas tree.
6412360	eng	Mary asked Tom if he knew why John didn't like her.
6412361	eng	Mary answered all the questions that Tom asked her.
6412362	eng	Mary admitted she didn't do what she said she'd do.
6412363	eng	Mary admitted she did what Tom asked her not to do.
6412364	eng	Mary accidentally locked herself out of her office.
6412365	eng	Let's see if Mary can manage to do that by herself.
6412366	eng	Let's get out of Mary's way and let her do her job.
6412367	eng	It's way past the time Mary promised she'd be here.
6412368	eng	It was hard for Mary to admit that she needed help.
6412369	eng	It looks like Mary was able to get what she wanted.
6412370	eng	If Mary had really wanted to do that, she would've.
6412371	eng	If Mary finds out what Tom did, she won't be happy.
6412372	eng	If Mary can help Tom, why can't she help John, too?
6412373	eng	I've already told Mary she can't go to Tom's party.
6412374	eng	I'm sure Mary wouldn't be forgiven if she did that.
6412375	eng	I'm sure Mary appreciates what you've done for her.
6412376	eng	I'm pretty sure that Mary can take care of herself.
6412377	eng	I'm pretty sure Mary doesn't know what she's doing.
6412378	eng	I'm not convinced that Mary can do that by herself.
6412379	eng	I'll ask Mary if we can borrow some money from her.
6412380	eng	I'd like to go to Mary's apartment and talk to her.
6412381	eng	I would've hugged Mary if I'd thought she'd let me.
6412382	eng	I wonder why Mary lied to us about what she'd done.
6412383	eng	I wonder what Mary will do with her old motorcycle.
6412384	eng	I wonder if Mary really thought she had to do that.
6412385	eng	I wonder if Mary really knew she needed to do that.
6412386	eng	I wish I'd done what Mary said she wanted me to do.
6412387	eng	I wish I hadn't suggested to Mary that she do that.
6412388	eng	I wish I hadn't promised Mary I'd help her do that.
6412389	eng	I was surprised when Mary told me why she did that.
6412390	eng	I wanted Mary to stay longer, but she had to leave.
6412391	eng	I told Mary that she should speak to you in French.
6412392	eng	I told Mary that I wanted to go to Boston with her.
6412393	eng	I told Mary she had only thirty minutes to do that.
6412394	eng	I told Mary not to let go of the rope, but she did.
6412395	eng	I told Mary I didn't want to go to Boston with her.
6412396	eng	I thought Mary wouldn't like the book Tom gave her.
6412397	eng	I thought Mary said she didn't want to get married.
6412398	eng	I thought Mary said she didn't know how to do that.
6412399	eng	I think we should let Mary go to Boston by herself.
6412400	eng	I think we should ask Mary where she wants to live.
6412401	eng	I think Mary would've helped us if she'd been here.
6412402	eng	I think Mary might get in trouble if she does that.
6412403	eng	I think Mary knows why we couldn't do that for her.
6412404	eng	I think Mary has never done that by herself before.
6412405	eng	I think Mary couldn't stop herself from doing that.
6412406	eng	I think Mary could do that if she really wanted to.
6412407	eng	I think Mary could do that by herself if she tried.
6412408	eng	I think Mary could be the boss if she wanted to be.
6412409	eng	I think I'll go visit Mary and see how she's doing.
6412410	eng	I know Mary has enough money to buy what she wants.
6412411	eng	I hope Mary knows she has to do that before Monday.
6412412	eng	I hope Mary has enough money to buy what she needs.
6412413	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what you asked her not to do.
6412414	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what Tom asked her not to do.
6412415	eng	I haven't seen Mary since she and Tom got divorced.
6412416	eng	I forgot to remind Mary that she needed to do that.
6412417	eng	I don't want to interrupt Mary while she's working.
6412418	eng	I don't want to bother Mary while she was studying.
6412419	eng	I don't think we should leave Mary here by herself.
6412420	eng	I don't think Mary will do what we asked her to do.
6412421	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she's supposed to do.
6412422	eng	I don't think Mary knows what Tom wants her to buy.
6412423	eng	I don't think Mary knows that Tom doesn't like her.
6412424	eng	I don't think Mary knows that I think she's stupid.
6412425	eng	I don't think Mary knows how much time she'll need.
6412426	eng	I don't think Mary could do that even if she tried.
6412427	eng	I didn't wake Mary up at 6:30 like she asked me to.
6412428	eng	I didn't think Mary would be doing that by herself.
6412429	eng	I didn't think Mary would be confused, but she was.
6412430	eng	I didn't realize that Mary wasn't enjoying herself.
6412431	eng	I didn't know Mary was going to do that by herself.
6412432	eng	I asked Mary if she wanted to go to Boston with me.
6412433	eng	I asked Mary if she knew anybody who taught French.
6412434	eng	How many of Mary's paintings have you sold for her?
6412435	eng	How did Mary persuade Tom to go to Boston with her?
6412436	eng	How did Mary get Tom to help her with her homework?
6412437	eng	Have you ever asked Mary why she enjoys doing that?
6412438	eng	Don't you think Mary could've done that by herself?
6412439	eng	Does Mary still go bowling as often as she used to?
6412440	eng	Do you think Mary would like me to do that for her?
6412441	eng	Do you really think Mary likes the gift I gave her?
6412442	eng	Do you know Mary well enough to ask her to do that?
6412443	eng	Did you tell Mary that she shouldn't be doing that?
6412444	eng	Did Mary tell you she asked Tom to babysit tonight?
6412445	eng	Did Mary say who was going to help her fix her car?
6412446	eng	Did Mary say she thought we didn't need to do that?
6412447	eng	Did Mary say she thought we didn't have to do that?
6412448	eng	Did Mary say she didn't think we needed to do that?
6412449	eng	Did Mary say how she was planning to get to Boston?
6412450	eng	As soon as Mary finished eating, she left for work.
6412451	eng	Are you going to give Mary the money she asked for?
6412452	eng	Are you certain that Mary can take care of herself?
6412453	eng	Almost all of Mary's ex-husbands still talk to her.
6412454	eng	You told me Mary was sick in bed. Why is she here?
6412455	eng	You should've told Mary why she needed to do that.
6412456	eng	You should tell Mary that you want her to do that.
6412457	eng	You should talk to Mary and tell her how you feel.
6412458	eng	You gave Mary the money she asked for, didn't you?
6412459	eng	You asked Mary why she had to do that, didn't you?
6412460	eng	Yesterday, Mary told me she couldn't speak French.
6412461	eng	Wouldn't it be better if Mary did that by herself?
6412462	eng	When Mary was young, she ate three eggs every day.
6412463	eng	What would've happened to Mary if she'd done that?
6412464	eng	What time did Mary say she wanted to take a break?
6412465	eng	We're not entirely sure why Mary did what she did.
6412466	eng	We'll probably never know why Mary killed herself.
6412467	eng	We should call Mary and see if she needs any help.
6412468	eng	They promised Mary that she'd be paid $30 an hour.
6412469	eng	There's no way Mary could've done this by herself.
6412470	eng	The last time I saw Mary she didn't look too well.
6412471	eng	Tell Mary that when she's finished, she can leave.
6412472	eng	Someone needs to tell Mary what's expected of her.
6412473	eng	Since Mary had a little free time, she took a nap.
6412474	eng	Please tell Mary that she doesn't need to do that.
6412475	eng	Please tell Mary that she doesn't have to do that.
6412476	eng	Please tell Mary she needs to do that before 2:30.
6412477	eng	No matter what Mary wears, she always looks great.
6412478	eng	Maybe Mary was really as busy as she said she was.
6412479	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know she's supposed to do that.
6412480	eng	Mary's parents got divorced when she was thirteen.
6412481	eng	Mary's parents allow her to do whatever she wants.
6412482	eng	Mary's parents allow her to do anything she wants.
6412483	eng	Mary's office is three miles from where she lives.
6412484	eng	Mary's mother told her to quit jumping on her bed.
6412485	eng	Mary's kids were here a while ago looking for her.
6412486	eng	Mary's friends knew she was having money problems.
6412487	eng	Mary's family is coming to visit her next weekend.
6412488	eng	Mary's bicycle was blue before she painted it red.
6412489	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me where she'd put my car keys.
6412490	eng	Mary wouldn't have sung if we hadn't asked her to.
6412491	eng	Mary wouldn't have done that if she hadn't had to.
6412492	eng	Mary wouldn't be doing that if she didn't have to.
6412493	eng	Mary would've done that if she'd really wanted to.
6412494	eng	Mary would've done that if Tom hadn't stopped her.
6412495	eng	Mary would be surprised if she saw Tom doing that.
6412496	eng	Mary would be disappointed if she saw you do that.
6412497	eng	Mary wondered what Tom was going to ask her to do.
6412498	eng	Mary wondered how much time she'd have to do that.
6412499	eng	Mary wondered how long she'd have to wait for Tom.
6412500	eng	Mary won't tell anyone where she was last weekend.
6412501	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom why she had to do that.
6412502	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom she intends to do that.
6412503	eng	Mary won't get there on time if she doesn't hurry.
6412504	eng	Mary won't be able to do that unless you help her.
6412505	eng	Mary wishes she could speak French as well as Tom.
6412506	eng	Mary wished she hadn't borrowed the book from Tom.
6412507	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom what she wants to eat.
6412508	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom what she wants to buy.
6412509	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom what she needs to buy.
6412510	eng	Mary will get herself killed if she's not careful.
6412511	eng	Mary will do that for you if you ask her politely.
6412512	eng	Mary went out of her way to make Tom feel at home.
6412513	eng	Mary wasn't willing to do what we asked her to do.
6412514	eng	Mary wasn't thirsty, so she didn't drink anything.
6412515	eng	Mary wasn't there for me when I really needed her.
6412516	eng	Mary wasn't scared to go into the cave by herself.
6412517	eng	Mary wasn't able to find what she was looking for.
6412518	eng	Mary was wearing a black hat when I first met her.
6412519	eng	Mary was walking too fast for me keep up with her.
6412520	eng	Mary was unwilling to do what we wanted her to do.
6412521	eng	Mary was thirteen when she moved here from Boston.
6412522	eng	Mary was lying to Tom when she said she'd do that.
6412523	eng	Mary was lying to Tom when she said she loved him.
6412524	eng	Mary was hoping she could persuade Tom to do that.
6412525	eng	Mary wants to spend the rest of her life with Tom.
6412526	eng	Mary wanted to leave, but I persuaded her to stay.
6412527	eng	Mary wanted the rest of the money that I owed her.
6412528	eng	Mary wanted me to tell Tom that she wasn't coming.
6412529	eng	Mary wanted me to give her enough time to do that.
6412530	eng	Mary wanted Tom to write a recommendation for her.
6412531	eng	Mary wanted Tom to help her clean the living room.
6412532	eng	Mary used to play tennis, but she doesn't anymore.
6412533	eng	Mary tried to catch up with Tom, but she couldn't.
6412534	eng	Mary treated herself to a large dish of ice cream.
6412535	eng	Mary told us the reason why she didn't want to go.
6412536	eng	Mary told me why she wanted me to do that for her.

6412717	eng	Mary said she wasn't permitted to do that anymore.
6412718	eng	Mary said she wasn't in the mood to do that today.
6412719	eng	Mary said she wasn't going to wait for permission.
6412720	eng	Mary said she wasn't aware that Tom had done that.
6412721	eng	Mary said she was willing to babysit our children.
6412722	eng	Mary said she was too old to go mountain climbing.
6412723	eng	Mary said she was the only one who had to do that.
6412724	eng	Mary said she was the one who was driving the car.
6412725	eng	Mary said she was sorry that she couldn't help me.
6412726	eng	Mary said she was kidnapped when she was thirteen.
6412727	eng	Mary said she was hoping we could travel together.
6412728	eng	Mary said she was going to talk to Tom about that.
6412729	eng	Mary said she wanted to visit Tom in the hospital.
6412730	eng	Mary said she wanted to go to Boston to visit Tom.
6412731	eng	Mary said she wanted to finish what she was doing.
6412732	eng	Mary said she wanted to be an electrical engineer.
6412733	eng	Mary said she wanted me to teach her how to drive.
6412734	eng	Mary said she tried to help Tom with his homework.
6412735	eng	Mary said she thought she wouldn't be able to win.
6412736	eng	Mary said she thought she should ask Tom to leave.
6412737	eng	Mary said she thought she knew what Tom had to do.
6412738	eng	Mary said she thought doing that wouldn't be safe.
6412739	eng	Mary said she thought Tom would forget to do that.
6412740	eng	Mary said she thought Tom wasn't ready to do that.
6412741	eng	Mary said she thought Tom wasn't going to do that.
6412742	eng	Mary said she thought Tom was unlikely to do that.
6412743	eng	Mary said she thought Tom needed to do that today.
6412744	eng	Mary said she thought Tom had finished doing that.
6412745	eng	Mary said she thought I might not want to do that.
6412746	eng	Mary said she thought I might not need to do that.
6412747	eng	Mary said she thought I might not have to do that.
6412748	eng	Mary said she thinks she can take care of herself.
6412749	eng	Mary said she thinks Tom won't be able to do that.
6412750	eng	Mary said she thinks Tom can't eat dairy products.
6412751	eng	Mary said she thinks Tom can take care of himself.
6412752	eng	Mary said she suspected that Tom wouldn't do that.
6412753	eng	Mary said she shouldn't have done that by herself.
6412754	eng	Mary said she saw Tom playing badminton with John.
6412755	eng	Mary said she saw Tom in the park just after 2:30.
6412756	eng	Mary said she remembers asking Tom not to do that.
6412757	eng	Mary said she probably wouldn't be busy on Monday.
6412758	eng	Mary said she might go to Boston in a week or two.
6412759	eng	Mary said she may stay in Boston for a few months.
6412760	eng	Mary said she learned how to do that the hard way.
6412761	eng	Mary said she knew why Tom wasn't able to do that.
6412762	eng	Mary said she knew we wouldn't be able to do that.
6412763	eng	Mary said she knew that Tom wouldn't win the race.
6412764	eng	Mary said she hopes Tom won't be late again today.
6412765	eng	Mary said she hopes Tom tries his best to do that.
6412766	eng	Mary said she hoped Tom would come to her concert.
6412767	eng	Mary said she hasn't yet talked to Tom about that.
6412768	eng	Mary said she hasn't talked to Tom about that yet.
6412769	eng	Mary said she has a lot of homework to do tonight.
6412770	eng	Mary said she had something important to tell Tom.
6412771	eng	Mary said she doesn't think Tom wanted to do that.
6412772	eng	Mary said she doesn't think Tom needed to do that.
6412773	eng	Mary said she doesn't think Tom enjoys doing that.
6412774	eng	Mary said she doesn't think Tom does that anymore.
6412775	eng	Mary said she doesn't have very much money on her.
6412776	eng	Mary said she doesn't have enough time to do that.
6412777	eng	Mary said she doesn't even want to think about it.
6412778	eng	Mary said she didn't want to study French anymore.
6412779	eng	Mary said she didn't want to sing with us anymore.
6412780	eng	Mary said she didn't want to go to Boston with me.
6412781	eng	Mary said she didn't want to go swimming with Tom.
6412782	eng	Mary said she didn't want to force you to do that.
6412783	eng	Mary said she didn't want to do anything with Tom.
6412784	eng	Mary said she didn't want to buy anything for Tom.
6412785	eng	Mary said she didn't want to allow Tom to do that.
6412786	eng	Mary said she didn't think the smell bothered Tom.
6412787	eng	Mary said she didn't think the noise bothered Tom.
6412788	eng	Mary said she didn't think that actually happened.
6412789	eng	Mary said she didn't think she'd enjoy doing that.
6412790	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom would've done that.
6412791	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom had ever done that.
6412792	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom enjoyed doing that.
6412793	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom could've done that.
6412794	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom could speak French.
6412795	eng	Mary said she didn't know Tom wasn't able to swim.
6412796	eng	Mary said she didn't know Tom was able to do that.
6412797	eng	Mary said she didn't have to stay in the hospital.
6412798	eng	Mary said she didn't have to do that until Monday.
6412799	eng	Mary said she didn't have the strength to do that.
6412800	eng	Mary said she didn't have the patience to do that.
6412801	eng	Mary said she didn't believe that really happened.
6412802	eng	Mary said she couldn't do what we asked her to do.
6412803	eng	Mary said she can't eat that much food by herself.
6412804	eng	Mary said it was more difficult than she expected.
6412805	eng	Mary said doing that was harder than she expected.
6412806	eng	Mary said doing that was easier than she expected.
6412807	eng	Mary said Tom was asleep by the time she got home.
6412808	eng	Mary said Tom told her she was sick of doing that.
6412809	eng	Mary said I should've asked her to do that for me.
6412810	eng	Mary realized there was nothing more she could do.
6412811	eng	Mary read a magazine while she waited for the bus.
6412812	eng	Mary promised that she wouldn't lie to me anymore.
6412813	eng	Mary promised me she'd never come back here again.
6412814	eng	Mary promised Tom that she wouldn't drink anymore.
6412815	eng	Mary promised Tom that she wouldn't do that again.
6412816	eng	Mary probably won't be able to do that on her own.
6412817	eng	Mary probably won't be able to do that by herself.
6412818	eng	Mary probably shouldn't tell Tom why she did that.
6412819	eng	Mary probably shouldn't tell Tom how she did that.
6412820	eng	Mary probably doesn't know what she did was wrong.
6412821	eng	Mary probably doesn't know how she should do that.
6412822	eng	Mary pretended she didn't know what was happening.
6412823	eng	Mary plans to start doing that as soon as she can.
6412824	eng	Mary never forgets to tell Tom that she loves him.
6412825	eng	Mary needed someone to help her with her homework.
6412826	eng	Mary moved over so that Tom could sit next to her.
6412827	eng	Mary might even be richer than we thought she was.
6412828	eng	Mary looked like she wasn't in a hurry to do that.
6412829	eng	Mary looked around, but she couldn't see anything.
6412830	eng	Mary lived in a small town until she was thirteen.
6412831	eng	Mary lied to Tom when she said she didn't do that.
6412832	eng	Mary learned how to drive when she was a teenager.
6412833	eng	Mary knows she's not very good at speaking French.
6412834	eng	Mary knows she's not supposed to help Tom do that.
6412835	eng	Mary knew there wasn't much she could do about it.
6412836	eng	Mary knew there was nothing she could do about it.
6412837	eng	Mary knew that I'd be gone by the time she got there.
6412838	eng	Mary knew she wasn't likely to be able to do that.
6412839	eng	Mary knew she didn't have anything to worry about.
6412840	eng	Mary isn't willing to do that unless you help her.
6412841	eng	Mary isn't still wearing her wedding ring, is she?
6412842	eng	Mary isn't likely to be hungry when she gets here.
6412843	eng	Mary isn't likely to allow Tom to do that for her.
6412844	eng	Mary isn't doing that because Tom told her not to.
6412845	eng	Mary isn't as good at French as she thinks she is.
6412846	eng	Mary isn't as busy this week as she was last week.
6412847	eng	Mary is upset with Tom because he didn't help her.
6412848	eng	Mary is trying to figure out what she needs to do.
6412849	eng	Mary is the best student in your class, isn't she?
6412850	eng	Mary is sure that she'll be able to pass the test.
6412851	eng	Mary is still sitting in her car, waiting for Tom.
6412852	eng	Mary is starting to sound exactly like her father.
6412853	eng	Mary is probably not as young as you think she is.
6412854	eng	Mary is probably not as smart as you think she is.
6412855	eng	Mary is probably not as happy as you think she is.
6412856	eng	Mary is probably going to tell Tom she'll do that.
6412857	eng	Mary is pretty sure that she'll pass today's exam.
6412858	eng	Mary is old enough to do that on her own, I think.
6412859	eng	Mary is now richer than she ever thought she'd be.
6412860	eng	Mary is much richer than most people think she is.
6412861	eng	Mary is lucky that so many people have helped her.
6412862	eng	Mary is happier than I've seen her in a long time.
6412863	eng	Mary is going to love the present you got for her.
6412864	eng	Mary is going to get fired if she doesn't do that.
6412865	eng	Mary is going to do that as soon as she gets home.
6412866	eng	Mary is going to be very tired when she gets home.
6412867	eng	Mary is going to be very sorry she didn't do that.
6412868	eng	Mary is going to be very happy she didn't do that.
6412869	eng	Mary is going to be in Boston all week, isn't she?
6412870	eng	Mary is from Boston, but now she lives in Chicago.
6412871	eng	Mary is fortunate that she's permitted to do that.
6412872	eng	Mary introduced me to her new boyfriend yesterday.
6412873	eng	Mary introduced her stepson to Tom's stepdaughter.
6412874	eng	Mary hopes that she doesn't have to do that again.
6412875	eng	Mary hopes that Tom will teach her how to do that.
6412876	eng	Mary hopes she'll be able to do that next October.
6412877	eng	Mary hasn't yet told us what she's supposed to do.
6412878	eng	Mary hasn't told us what she's supposed to do yet.
6412879	eng	Mary has told you about what happened, hasn't she?
6412880	eng	Mary has refused to do what we've asked her to do.
6412881	eng	Mary has promised that she'll never be late again.
6412882	eng	Mary has known how to do that since she was three.
6412883	eng	Mary has enough money to do anything she wants to.
6412884	eng	Mary has enough money to buy everything she wants.
6412885	eng	Mary has enough money to buy everything she needs.
6412886	eng	Mary has decided she's the one who should do that.
6412887	eng	Mary has been told that she's required to do that.
6412888	eng	Mary has been speaking French since she was a kid.
6412889	eng	Mary has been fired from every job she's ever had.
6412890	eng	Mary has already bought what Tom asked her to buy.
6412891	eng	Mary has a list of people to she wants to talk to.
6412892	eng	Mary hardly ever does what you'd expect her to do.
6412893	eng	Mary had to borrow money from Tom to pay her rent.
6412894	eng	Mary had a rich uncle who left her a lot of money.
6412895	eng	Mary had a fairly good job until she got laid off.
6412896	eng	Mary got out of the bathtub and dried herself off.
6412897	eng	Mary got her first chance to do that this morning.
6412898	eng	Mary freaked out when she heard what Tom had done.
6412899	eng	Mary found a job not too far from where she lives.
6412900	eng	Mary found Tom's umbrella in the trunk of her car.
6412901	eng	Mary finally managed to buy everything she needed.
6412902	eng	Mary filled her glass and then filled one for Tom.
6412903	eng	Mary fell in love with Tom the moment she met him.
6412904	eng	Mary eventually did everything we asked her to do.
6412905	eng	Mary dropped out of college when she was a junior.
6412906	eng	Mary dropped everything she was doing to help Tom.
6412907	eng	Mary doubts that she'll be able get there on time.
6412908	eng	Mary doesn't want to study French, but she has to.
6412909	eng	Mary doesn't understand what you expect her to do.
6412910	eng	Mary doesn't trust anyone else to do that for her.
6412911	eng	Mary doesn't think she'll ever be able to do that.
6412912	eng	Mary doesn't think she'll be permitted to do that.
6412913	eng	Mary doesn't think she wants to do that right now.
6412914	eng	Mary doesn't think Tom would allow her to do that.
6412915	eng	Mary doesn't think Tom will permit her to do that.
6412916	eng	Mary doesn't really want to eat with us, does she?
6412917	eng	Mary doesn't really think I can do that, does she?
6412918	eng	Mary doesn't need to go there unless she wants to.
6412919	eng	Mary doesn't know why Tom and John don't like her.
6412920	eng	Mary doesn't know what she's supposed to be doing.
6412921	eng	Mary doesn't know she's not likely to be punished.
6412922	eng	Mary doesn't know she'll never be able to do that.
6412923	eng	Mary doesn't know how to explain how she did that.
6412924	eng	Mary doesn't know Tom, but she'd like to meet him.
6412925	eng	Mary doesn't have to go there unless she wants to.
6412926	eng	Mary doesn't have any idea how much Tom loves her.
6412927	eng	Mary doesn't carry much with her when she travels.
6412928	eng	Mary doesn't care what other people say about her.
6412929	eng	Mary didn't want to tell anybody where she'd been.
6412930	eng	Mary didn't want to stop doing what she was doing.
6412931	eng	Mary didn't want me to help her with her homework.
6412932	eng	Mary didn't think that anyone would recognize her.
6412933	eng	Mary didn't think Tom would permit her to do that.
6412934	eng	Mary didn't tell Tom she wouldn't be at his party.
6412935	eng	Mary didn't tell Tom she didn't intend to do that.
6412936	eng	Mary didn't seem to be enjoying herself very much.
6412937	eng	Mary didn't learn how to do that from her parents.
6412938	eng	Mary didn't know why she'd been chosen to do that.
6412939	eng	Mary didn't know when she was supposed to do that.
6412940	eng	Mary didn't know what to say, so she said nothing.
6412941	eng	Mary didn't know that she was supposed to do that.
6412942	eng	Mary didn't know that she needed to do that today.
6412943	eng	Mary didn't know that Tom expected her to do that.
6412944	eng	Mary didn't know she no longer needed to help Tom.
6412945	eng	Mary didn't know how long she should wait for Tom.
6412946	eng	Mary didn't know exactly what was expected of her.
6412947	eng	Mary didn't have to tell me, but I'm glad she did.
6412948	eng	Mary didn't have to do that if she didn't want to.
6412949	eng	Mary didn't do that the way Tom told her to do it.
6412950	eng	Mary didn't believe Tom when he said he loved her.
6412951	eng	Mary didn't actually want to eat with us, did she?
6412952	eng	Mary didn't act like she really wanted to be here.
6412953	eng	Mary did better today than she's ever done before.
6412954	eng	Mary did a lot better today than she usually does.
6412955	eng	Mary deleted all of Tom's pictures from her phone.
6412956	eng	Mary decided not to tell Tom that she was leaving.
6412957	eng	Mary cried herself to sleep every night last week.
6412958	eng	Mary couldn't find anyone to give her a ride home.
6412959	eng	Mary couldn't do what we were hoping she could do.
6412960	eng	Mary couldn't do it, so she asked Tom to help her.
6412961	eng	Mary couldn't afford to buy everything she needed.
6412962	eng	Mary could've been scared, but she didn't show it.
6412963	eng	Mary could think of no reason why she should stay.
6412964	eng	Mary could never do what you are asking her to do.
6412965	eng	Mary concealed the fact that she'd been in prison.
6412966	eng	Mary closed the curtains before she got undressed.
6412967	eng	Mary chuckled to herself as she read Tom's letter.
6412968	eng	Mary can't really be as rich as people say she is.
6412969	eng	Mary can't really be as mean as people say she is.
6412970	eng	Mary can't do that alone. I hope Tom can help her.
6412971	eng	Mary can't do it alone. Could you please help her?
6412972	eng	Mary can tell me what happened when she gets here.
6412973	eng	Mary can come over to my place whenever she wants.
6412974	eng	Mary called to say she wouldn't be home for lunch.
6412975	eng	Mary called Tom every bad name she could think of.
6412976	eng	Mary bet me thirty dollars that she could do that.
6412977	eng	Mary began to write poems when she was very young.
6412978	eng	Mary assured us that she wouldn't do that anymore.
6412979	eng	Mary assured me that she wouldn't do that anymore.
6412980	eng	Mary asked Tom what she should bring to the party.
6412981	eng	Mary asked Tom to tell her why he was leaving her.
6412982	eng	Mary asked Tom to teach her how to play the flute.
6412983	eng	Mary asked Tom to help her, but he didn't want to.
6412984	eng	Mary asked Tom if he'd help her with her homework.
6412985	eng	Mary apparently went to the lighthouse by herself.
6412986	eng	Mary apparently didn't do what we asked her to do.
6412987	eng	Mary admitted that she didn't know how to do that.
6412988	eng	Mary admitted that she didn't have any experience.
6412989	eng	Mary admitted she did what we asked her not to do.
6412990	eng	Mary admitted she did what she promised not to do.
6412991	eng	Mary admitted she did what Tom told her not to do.
6412992	eng	Mary admits she's been doing that for a long time.
6412993	eng	If you see Mary, ask her how her husband is doing.
6412994	eng	If you have a question for Mary, ask her yourself.
6412995	eng	If you give me Mary's phone number, I'll call her.
6412996	eng	If Mary's not careful, she's going to get injured.
6412997	eng	If Mary really had wanted to do that, she would've
6412998	eng	If Mary messes up again, she's going to get fired.
6412999	eng	If Mary doesn't want to help, she doesn't have to.
6413000	eng	I'm sure Mary will tell us if she needs something.
6413001	eng	I'm sure Mary will do anything Tom asks her to do.
6413002	eng	I'm pretty sure Mary did that while she was drunk.
6413003	eng	I'm not going to let Mary go to Boston by herself.
6413004	eng	I'm going to tell Mary what I really think of her.
6413005	eng	I'll text Mary and see if she wants to go with us.
6413006	eng	I'll tell Mary to call you as soon as she gets in.
6413007	eng	I wouldn't allow Mary to do what she wanted to do.
6413008	eng	I wonder whether Mary really regrets what she did.
6413009	eng	I wonder if Mary really did what she said she did.
6413010	eng	I wonder if Mary really did what Tom said she did.
6413011	eng	I wish Mary wouldn't go out after dark by herself.
6413012	eng	I wasn't the one who told Mary she should do that.
6413013	eng	I wasn't the one who told Mary she had to do that.
6413014	eng	I was surprised when Mary told me what she'd done.
6413015	eng	I was surprised when Mary told me she'd done that.
6413016	eng	I was going to tell Mary what we expect her to do.
6413017	eng	I told Mary that I wouldn't go to Boston with her.
6413018	eng	I told Mary not to do that, but she did it anyway.
6413019	eng	I told Mary I'd be willing to loan her some money.
6413020	eng	I told Mary I wouldn't do what she asked me to do.
6413021	eng	I told Mary I wanted her to teach me how to drive.
6413022	eng	I thought Mary would have all the time she needed.
6413023	eng	I thought Mary was supposed to do that by herself.
6413024	eng	I think Mary will be exhausted when she gets home.
6413025	eng	I think Mary will be able to do that if she tries.
6413026	eng	I think Mary shouldn't tell Tom that she did that.
6413027	eng	I think Mary should be able to do that by herself.
6413028	eng	I think Mary might not want to do that by herself.
6413029	eng	I think Mary isn't sure that's what she has to do.
6413030	eng	I think Mary could've done that faster by herself.
6413031	eng	I think Mary could do that today if she wanted to.
6413032	eng	I think Mary could be a teacher if she wanted to be.
6413033	eng	I talked to Mary today about what she plans to do.
6413034	eng	I should've told Mary why she had to go to Boston.
6413035	eng	I should've never let Mary go swimming by herself.
6413036	eng	I saw Mary a few minutes ago and she looked tired.
6413037	eng	I promised Mary I'd listen to what she had to say.
6413038	eng	I looked all over for Mary, but couldn't find her.
6413039	eng	I know Mary didn't leave when she was supposed to.
6413040	eng	I hope Mary knows why she doesn't need to do that.
6413041	eng	I hope Mary knows why she doesn't have to do that.
6413042	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what you told her not to do.
6413043	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what we asked her not to do.
6413044	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what Tom told her not to do.
6413045	eng	I forgot to tell Mary what she was supposed to do.
6413046	eng	I forgot to ask Mary what you asked me to ask her.
6413047	eng	I fell in love with Mary the first time I saw her.
6413048	eng	I emailed Mary and told her I'd be busy next week.
6413049	eng	I don't want Mary to go out after dark by herself.
6413050	eng	I don't think Mary would do what you said she did.
6413051	eng	I don't think Mary loves me as much as I love her.
6413052	eng	I don't think Mary likes you the way you like her.
6413053	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom is scared of her.
6413054	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom is afraid of her.
6413055	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she's talking about.
6413056	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she needs to do yet.
6413057	eng	I don't think Mary knows what Tom wants her to do.
6413058	eng	I don't think Mary knows she has to do that today.
6413059	eng	I don't know why Mary doesn't want me to help her.
6413060	eng	I didn't think Mary would go to Boston by herself.
6413061	eng	I didn't think Mary would eat what I made for her.
6413062	eng	I didn't show Mary the pictures she wanted to see.
6413063	eng	I didn't know Mary was going to Boston by herself.
6413064	eng	I didn't know Mary until Tom introduced her to me.
6413065	eng	I couldn't help Mary do what she was trying to do.
6413066	eng	I asked Mary when she had started studying French.
6413067	eng	I asked Mary what she thought was going to happen.
6413068	eng	I asked Mary not to go there, but she went anyway.
6413069	eng	How did Mary get you to help her clean the garage?
6413070	eng	Have you ever asked Mary why she likes doing that?
6413071	eng	Eventually, Mary will realize that she needs help.
6413072	eng	Even though Mary had a bad cold, she went to work.
6413073	eng	Does Mary still do the same things she used to do?
6413074	eng	Does Mary really think she can do that by herself?
6413075	eng	Does Mary really think Tom is younger than she is?
6413076	eng	Does Mary really think Tom enjoys eating with her?
6413077	eng	Do you think Mary will like the gift I bought her?
6413078	eng	Do you think Mary can really take care of herself?
6413079	eng	Do you remember what time Mary said she'd be here?
6413080	eng	Do you really think Mary can take care of herself?
6413081	eng	Did you ask Mary who helped her with her homework?
6413082	eng	Did you ask Mary what she thought the problem was?
6413083	eng	Did Mary tell you how long it took her to do that?
6413084	eng	Did Mary really want Tom to go to Boston with her?
6413085	eng	Could you please tell Mary that I need to see her?
6413086	eng	Are you sure Mary knows what she's supposed to do?
6413087	eng	Are you sure Mary didn't do what she said she did?
6413088	eng	Are you sure Mary didn't do what Tom said she did?
6413089	eng	You seem convinced that Mary did that by herself.
6413090	eng	You asked Mary to do that by herself, didn't you?
6413091	eng	You asked Mary if she had to do that, didn't you?
6413092	eng	Why don't you ask Mary what she's planning to do?
6413093	eng	Why didn't you tell Mary that she had to do that?
6413094	eng	Why didn't you give Mary the money she asked for?
6413095	eng	Whenever Mary comes to Boston, she stays with us.
6413096	eng	When Mary left, I told her she'd be back someday.
6413097	eng	What time did Mary say she was going to get here?
6413098	eng	What time did Mary say she wanted us to be there?
6413099	eng	We must make sure that Mary doesn't hurt herself.
6413100	eng	Unfortunately, Mary did what you told her not to.
6413101	eng	There's no way Mary will ever do that by herself.
6413102	eng	The reason Mary isn't here is because she's sick.
6413103	eng	The reason Mary got sick was because she overate.
6413104	eng	The last time I saw Mary, she was on a stretcher.
6413105	eng	The last time I saw Mary she was eating an apple.
6413106	eng	Tell Mary we're going to meet her at the airport.
6413107	eng	Tell Mary she's going to have to work late today.
6413108	eng	Tell Mary I grew up in Boston, just like she did.
6413109	eng	Please tell Mary she has to get home before 2:30.
6413110	eng	Please tell Mary I'll pick her up at the station.
6413111	eng	My advice is to tell Mary what she wants to know.
6413112	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know she has to do that today.
6413113	eng	Mary's parents are too strict to let her do that.
6413114	eng	Mary wrote to Tom to tell him that she loved him.
6413115	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me who gave her that envelope.
6413116	eng	Mary wouldn't tell Tom why she wanted to do that.
6413117	eng	Mary wouldn't go to Boston if she didn't have to.
6413118	eng	Mary would've eaten more if she hadn't been sick.
6413119	eng	Mary would sing another song if you asked her to.
6413120	eng	Mary wondered why nobody had told her about that.
6413121	eng	Mary wondered why Tom didn't want to talk to her.
6413122	eng	Mary won't tell me who gave her those binoculars.
6413123	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom what she wants to eat.
6413124	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom what she needs to buy.
6413125	eng	Mary won't likely be as careful as she should be.
6413126	eng	Mary won't be able to do what you want her to do.
6413127	eng	Mary wished that she knew Tom's telephone number.
6413128	eng	Mary wished she hadn't asked Tom quit doing that.
6413129	eng	Mary will unlikely be able to do that by herself.
6413130	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom what she wants to do.
6413131	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom what she needs to do.
6413132	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she'll never do that.
6413133	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she wants to do that.

6413136	eng	Mary will probably get arrested if she does that.
6413137	eng	Mary will probably be starved when she gets home.
6413138	eng	Mary will pay me back what she owes me on Monday.
6413139	eng	Mary will be absent today because she has a cold.

6413145	eng	Mary wasn't able to do anything she wanted to do.
6413146	eng	Mary wasn't able to do anything she needed to do.
6413147	eng	Mary was unwilling to do what we asked her to do.
6413148	eng	Mary was told that she isn't required to do that.
6413149	eng	Mary was lying when she said she didn't know Tom.
6413150	eng	Mary was lying to Tom when she said she did that.

6413458	eng	Mary said she didn't get enough sleep last night.
6413459	eng	Mary said she couldn't figure out how to do that.
6413460	eng	Mary said she could swim at least as well as Tom.
6413461	eng	Mary said it was her who should help Tom do that.
6413462	eng	Mary said it was Tom who borrowed her sunglasses.
6413463	eng	Mary said everybody she knows has been to Boston.
6413464	eng	Mary said Tom would likely go to Boston with her.
6413465	eng	Mary said Tom knew she might not need to do that.
6413466	eng	Mary said Tom knew she might not have to do that.
6413467	eng	Mary said I shouldn't do that until she got back.
6413468	eng	Mary retired from the company when she turned 65.
6413469	eng	Mary refused to do what I told her she had to do.
6413470	eng	Mary refused to believe that Tom didn't like her.
6413471	eng	Mary really enjoys talking with Tom, doesn't she?
6413472	eng	Mary realized there was no way she could do that.
6413473	eng	Mary realized that she'd fallen in love with Tom.
6413474	eng	Mary realized she didn't have to do that anymore.
6413475	eng	Mary realized Tom was no longer in love with her.
6413476	eng	Mary puts salt on just about everything she eats.

6413483	eng	Mary promised Tom that she'd never do that again.
6413484	eng	Mary promised Tom that she wouldn't tell anybody.
6413485	eng	Mary probably won't be hungry when she gets here.
6413486	eng	Mary probably doesn't know what she needs to buy.
6413487	eng	Mary probably doesn't know she shouldn't do that.
6413488	eng	Mary pretended that she didn't know Tom was rich.
6413489	eng	Mary pretended she didn't see Tom do what he did.
6413490	eng	Mary pretended she didn't know what was going on.
6413491	eng	Mary pretended she didn't know anything about it.

6413495	eng	Mary only eats vegetables that she grows herself.
6413496	eng	Mary often reads bedtime stories to her children.
6413497	eng	Mary never told me she used to be married to Tom.

6413499	eng	Mary never should've told Tom that she loved him.
6413500	eng	Mary never has apologized for what she did to us.
6413501	eng	Mary must've traveled a lot when she was younger.
6413502	eng	Mary might not have done what people say she did.
6413503	eng	Mary may come and visit me any time she wants to.
6413504	eng	Mary managed to carry all three boxes by herself.
6413505	eng	Mary makes mistakes every time she speaks French.
6413506	eng	Mary made it clear that she didn't want me there.

6413514	eng	Mary let us know that she didn't mind doing that.
6413515	eng	Mary let Tom know she didn't know how to do that.
6413516	eng	Mary learned how to swim when she was very young.
6413517	eng	Mary learned how to do that when she was a child.
6413518	eng	Mary learned how to do that from her grandfather.
6413519	eng	Mary laughed when I told her about what happened.
6413520	eng	Mary knows she's not supposed to do that anymore.
6413521	eng	Mary knows she'll never be able to do that again.
6413522	eng	Mary knows Tom better than she knows anyone else.
6413523	eng	Mary knew there was nothing she could do to help.
6413524	eng	Mary knew that she was going to get into trouble.
6413525	eng	Mary knew she wasn't going to be able to do that.
6413526	eng	Mary knew she didn't have enough time to do that.
6413527	eng	Mary kept working even though she was very tired.
6413528	eng	Mary kept on walking even though she was in pain.
6413529	eng	Mary isn't really going to eat that frog, is she?
6413530	eng	Mary isn't going to go to Boston with us, is she?
6413531	eng	Mary isn't doing what she's supposed to be doing.
6413532	eng	Mary isn't as good at French as you think she is.
6413533	eng	Mary is wearing clothes that are too big for her.
6413534	eng	Mary is unable to decide who she should vote for.
6413535	eng	Mary is supposed to do that before she goes home.

6413537	eng	Mary is still just as friendly as she used to be.
6413538	eng	Mary is saving money so she can buy a motorcycle.
6413539	eng	Mary is probably not going to do that by herself.

6413541	eng	Mary is probably not as rich as she claims to be.
6413542	eng	Mary is probably not as busy as you think she is.
6413543	eng	Mary is looking for somebody to teach her French.
6413544	eng	Mary is likely going to lose everything she owns.
6413545	eng	Mary is going to try to convince you to help her.
6413546	eng	Mary is going to try to convince Tom to help her.
6413547	eng	Mary is going to get very dirty if she does that.
6413548	eng	Mary is going to get killed if she's not careful.
6413549	eng	Mary is going to get in trouble if she does that.
6413550	eng	Mary is going to do whatever she can to help you.
6413551	eng	Mary is going to do that the way you told her to.
6413552	eng	Mary is going to do everything you ask her to do.
6413553	eng	Mary is going to do everything she's asked to do.
6413554	eng	Mary is going to be very glad she didn't do that.
6413555	eng	Mary is going to be fired if she does that again.
6413556	eng	Mary is going to be fined if she does that again.
6413557	eng	Mary is going to be exhausted when she gets home.
6413558	eng	Mary is fairly sure she can take care of herself.
6413559	eng	Mary is already old enough to do that by herself.
6413560	eng	Mary is a little bit tired, so she won't do that.
6413561	eng	Mary introduced herself to the rest of the class.
6413562	eng	Mary immigrated to Australia when she was thirty.
6413563	eng	Mary hid under her bed, but her mother found her.
6413564	eng	Mary helped herself to another dish of ice cream.
6413565	eng	Mary hasn't yet told us what she wants us to buy.
6413566	eng	Mary hasn't yet told me why she needs to do that.
6413567	eng	Mary hasn't yet realized that she's made a mistake.
6413568	eng	Mary hasn't let her kids do that very many times.
6413569	eng	Mary has told Tom that she's required to do that.
6413570	eng	Mary has to do that before she can go home today.

6413574	eng	Mary has never gone mountain climbing by herself.
6413575	eng	Mary has never apologized for what she did to us.
6413576	eng	Mary has finally done what she promised she'd do.
6413577	eng	Mary has done that more than she'd like to admit.
6413578	eng	Mary has been waiting for Tom to do that for her.
6413579	eng	Mary has been doing that ever since she got home.
6413580	eng	Mary had enough time to do what she wanted to do.
6413581	eng	Mary had enough time to do what she needed to do.
6413582	eng	Mary had enough money to buy what she had to buy.
6413583	eng	Mary gave me three reasons why she couldn't help.
6413584	eng	Mary gave away most of her money before she died.
6413585	eng	Mary gave Tom the note I'd given her to give him.
6413586	eng	Mary gave Tom exactly what he told her he needed.
6413587	eng	Mary forgot to tell Tom what time she'd be there.
6413588	eng	Mary forgot to lock the front door when she left.
6413589	eng	Mary finally noticed that Tom was staring at her.
6413590	eng	Mary finally managed to persuade Tom to help her.
6413591	eng	Mary figured if Tom could do that, she could too.
6413592	eng	Mary expects all three of us to do that with her.
6413593	eng	Mary expected Tom to sit with her at the concert.
6413594	eng	Mary dropped out of school when she was thirteen.
6413595	eng	Mary doesn't want anyone to know that she's rich.
6413596	eng	Mary doesn't want Tom to go anywhere without her.
6413597	eng	Mary doesn't think they'll permit her to do that.
6413598	eng	Mary doesn't think Tom will allow her to do that.
6413599	eng	Mary doesn't really want to live there, does she?
6413600	eng	Mary doesn't really think Tom did that, does she?
6413601	eng	Mary doesn't really care whether she wins or not.
6413602	eng	Mary doesn't need to come if she doesn't want to.
6413603	eng	Mary doesn't like spinach, so she didn't eat any.

6413608	eng	Mary doesn't have to sing if she doesn't want to.
6413609	eng	Mary doesn't have to help if she doesn't want to.
6413610	eng	Mary doesn't have to come if she doesn't want to.
6413611	eng	Mary doesn't have Tom to do that for her anymore.
6413612	eng	Mary doesn't deserve the salary we're paying her.
6413613	eng	Mary does that the way Tom taught her to do that.
6413614	eng	Mary does just about everything we ask her to do.
6413615	eng	Mary died three days after she arrived in Boston.
6413616	eng	Mary didn't want the same thing to happen to her.
6413617	eng	Mary didn't think Tom would allow her to do that.
6413618	eng	Mary didn't tell the stranger who she really was.
6413619	eng	Mary didn't tell me why she wanted me to do that.
6413620	eng	Mary didn't tell me she wanted to be a scientist.
6413621	eng	Mary didn't tell anyone what she was about to do.
6413622	eng	Mary didn't really enjoy eating with us, did she?
6413623	eng	Mary didn't provide details of how she'd do that.
6413624	eng	Mary didn't pay me as much as she said she'd pay.
6413625	eng	Mary didn't mention where she was planning to go.
6413626	eng	Mary didn't lose as much weight as she wanted to.
6413627	eng	Mary didn't look like she was having a good time.

6413631	eng	Mary didn't know she no longer needed to do that.
6413632	eng	Mary didn't know for certain where she should go.
6413633	eng	Mary didn't do that as well as I expected her to.
6413634	eng	Mary didn't call Tom like she promised she would.
6413635	eng	Mary did better this time than she did last time.
6413636	eng	Mary definitely knows that she shouldn't be here.
6413637	eng	Mary couldn't have done that by herself, I think.
6413638	eng	Mary couldn't get Tom to tell her what was wrong.
6413639	eng	Mary couldn't do anything she was supposed to do.
6413640	eng	Mary couldn't decide what she should buy for Tom.
6413641	eng	Mary couldn't borrow as much money as she needed.
6413642	eng	Mary could've won if she'd tried a little harder.
6413643	eng	Mary could've refused to do that, but she didn't.
6413644	eng	Mary could've done better if she'd had more time.
6413645	eng	Mary could stay with us tonight if she wanted to.
6413646	eng	Mary could be busy now, but I don't think she is.
6413647	eng	Mary convinced Tom to buy her an expensive watch.
6413648	eng	Mary continued to do that until the day she died.
6413649	eng	Mary certainly did everything we asked her to do.
6413650	eng	Mary can't really see anything from where she is.
6413651	eng	Mary can't play the piano as well as she used to.
6413652	eng	Mary can't cook very well, so she often eats out.
6413653	eng	Mary called the office to say that she'd be late.
6413654	eng	Mary bragged about how well she could play chess.
6413655	eng	Mary began writing poems when she was very young.

6413660	eng	Mary asked me if she could borrow thirty dollars.
6413661	eng	Mary asked me if I would help her move her piano.
6413662	eng	Mary asked if she was really required to do that.
6413663	eng	Mary asked if she really needed to wear a helmet.
6413664	eng	Mary asked her father to help her make a snowman.
6413665	eng	Mary asked Tom to lend her three hundred dollars.
6413666	eng	Mary asked Tom not to kiss her in public anymore.
6413667	eng	Mary apparently didn't do what she said she'd do.
6413668	eng	Mary always tries to do what she thinks is right.
6413669	eng	Mary already knows that Tom wants her to do that.
6413670	eng	Mary allowed Tom to sit next to her on the bench.
6413671	eng	Mary admitted she didn't want to do that anymore.
6413672	eng	Let's hope Mary didn't do what you think she did.
6413673	eng	It's entirely up to Mary whether she goes or not.
6413674	eng	It was easy for Mary to convince Tom to help her.
6413675	eng	Is Mary wearing the new shirt you bought for her?
6413676	eng	If you don't do what Mary says, she'll get angry.
6413677	eng	I'm sure Mary wouldn't have done that by herself.
6413678	eng	I'm sure Mary understands what we want her to do.
6413679	eng	I'm pretty sure Mary did what we asked her to do.
6413680	eng	I'm going to allow Mary to do whatever she wants.
6413681	eng	I'm certain Mary will do what she says she'll do.
6413682	eng	I'll make sure Mary does what we asked her to do.
6413683	eng	I wonder whether Mary thought she had to do that.
6413684	eng	I wonder whether Mary really meant what she said.
6413685	eng	I wonder whether Mary knew she needed to do that.
6413686	eng	I wonder whether Mary did what she said she'd do.
6413687	eng	I wonder if Mary's friends would really help her.
6413688	eng	I wonder if Mary really can take care of herself.
6413689	eng	I wonder if Mary did what she was supposed to do.
6413690	eng	I wonder if Mary can really take care of herself.
6413691	eng	I wonder if Mary asked Tom to eat lunch with her.
6413692	eng	I wasn't sure what Mary wanted me to buy for her.
6413693	eng	I tried to get Mary to help me, but she wouldn't.
6413694	eng	I told Mary that she shouldn't go out after dark.
6413695	eng	I told Mary that I never wanted to see her again.
6413696	eng	I thought Mary wouldn't enjoy camping by herself.
6413697	eng	I thought Mary said she liked this kind of music.
6413698	eng	I think we shouldn't let Mary do that by herself.
6413699	eng	I think that Mary lied to you about what she did.
6413700	eng	I think Mary went into the woods to kill herself.
6413701	eng	I think Mary shouldn't tell Tom why she did that.
6413702	eng	I think Mary shouldn't tell Tom how she did that.
6413703	eng	I think Mary might get punished if she does that.
6413704	eng	I think Mary is sure that's what she needs to do.
6413705	eng	I think Mary could do better if she tried harder.
6413706	eng	I should've told Mary that she needed to do that.
6413707	eng	I should tell Mary I won't go to Boston with her.
6413708	eng	I should probably tell Mary what she needs to do.
6413709	eng	I looked Mary in the eyes and told her the truth.
6413710	eng	I knew Mary would ask Tom to eat dinner with her.
6413711	eng	I hope Mary remembers where she buried the money.
6413712	eng	I hope Mary does everything she's promised to do.
6413713	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what we told her not to do.
6413714	eng	I haven't spoken with Mary since she got married.
6413715	eng	I don't think Mary will be doing that by herself.
6413716	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom is ignoring her.
6413717	eng	I don't think Mary knows who's going to help her.
6413718	eng	I don't think Mary knows she's going to be fired.
6413719	eng	I don't think Mary knows how Tom feels about her.
6413720	eng	I don't think Mary has ever done that by herself.
6413721	eng	I didn't want Mary to leave, but she left anyway.
6413722	eng	I didn't think Mary would be afraid, but she was.
6413723	eng	I didn't notice that Mary was sitting by herself.
6413724	eng	I didn't know Mary would go to Boston by herself.
6413725	eng	I didn't give Mary the information she requested.
6413726	eng	I didn't believe Mary when she said she loved me.
6413727	eng	I can't find Mary. I think she must've gone home.
6413728	eng	I asked Mary why she did that the way she did it.
6413729	eng	I asked Mary when she thought Tom would get here.
6413730	eng	I asked Mary if she wanted to go and she said no.
6413731	eng	How often does Mary wear that scarf you gave her?
6413732	eng	How much time did it take Mary to clean her room?
6413733	eng	How long did Mary say she'd been studying French?
6413734	eng	How did Mary know she wasn't supposed to do that?
6413735	eng	Have you ever asked Mary why she doesn't do that?
6413736	eng	Either Mary doesn't want to do that or she can't.
6413737	eng	Does Mary know we can't do that without her help?
6413738	eng	Do you want to know why Mary did that by herself?
6413739	eng	Do you think Mary can still take care of herself?
6413740	eng	Did you tell Mary she's not allowed in this room?
6413741	eng	Did you know Mary before she came to work for us?
6413742	eng	Did you ask Mary if she could do that by herself?
6413743	eng	Did Mary say it was necessary for her to do that?
6413744	eng	Did Mary ever tell you what she wanted you to do?
6413745	eng	Did Mary actually do everything she said she did?
6413746	eng	Could you please tell Mary I need to talk to her?
6413747	eng	Can you please just give Mary whatever she wants?
6413748	eng	Ask Mary if she really needs to be there by 2:30.
6413749	eng	As soon as Mary heard the phone, she answered it.
6413750	eng	You'd think they'd tell Mary what she should do.
6413751	eng	You should've told Mary that she had to do that.
6413752	eng	You should've let Mary do what she wanted to do.
6413753	eng	You should tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
6413754	eng	You not only look like Mary, you sound like her.
6413755	eng	You can't make Mary help if she doesn't want to.
6413756	eng	You asked Mary if she could do that, didn't you?
6413757	eng	Would you tell Mary why you want her to do that?
6413758	eng	Would you just tell Mary what she did was wrong?
6413759	eng	Why should Mary insist that Tom do that for her?
6413760	eng	Why don't you just tell Mary you don't like her?
6413761	eng	Why don't you just tell Mary you don't like her.
6413762	eng	Why don't you ask Mary what she thinks happened?
6413763	eng	Who did Mary think was going to do that for her?
6413764	eng	When do you think Mary will want us to help her?
6413765	eng	When Mary heard about what happened, she smiled.
6413766	eng	When I first met Mary, she was still a teenager.
6413767	eng	We simply can't just leave Mary here by herself.
6413768	eng	We should ask Mary what she thinks we should do.
6413769	eng	We know Mary will do whatever we tell her to do.
6413770	eng	We hope Mary will do what we've asked her to do.
6413771	eng	This is where Mary said she found the gold coin.
6413772	eng	They told Mary to stop doing what she was doing.
6413773	eng	The only person Mary says she'll talk to is Tom.
6413774	eng	Tell Mary I'd like to meet with her immediately.
6413775	eng	Talk to Mary and see what she thinks about this.
6413776	eng	Should we tell Mary she doesn't need to do that?
6413777	eng	Should we tell Mary she doesn't have to do that?
6413778	eng	Remind me to thank Mary the next time I see her.
6413779	eng	Please tell Mary what you think she ought to do.
6413780	eng	Please tell Mary what you think she needs to do.
6413781	eng	Please tell Mary that she's required to do that.
6413782	eng	Please tell Mary she has to do that before 2:30.
6413783	eng	Please tell Mary everything we want her to know.
6413784	eng	One of us will have to ask Mary what she thinks.
6413785	eng	Maybe Mary thought you wouldn't want to see her.
6413786	eng	Maybe Mary should quit before she hurts herself.
6413787	eng	Maybe Mary didn't do what everyone says she did.
6413788	eng	Mary's memory's getting worse as she gets older.
6413789	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me why she wanted to do that.
6413790	eng	Mary wouldn't tell Tom why she wouldn't do that.
6413791	eng	Mary wouldn't like it if she knew you were here.
6413792	eng	Mary wouldn't have let her own children do that.
6413793	eng	Mary wouldn't drink the coffee Tom made for her.
6413794	eng	Mary wouldn't do something like that by herself.
6413795	eng	Mary would've done that already if she knew how.
6413796	eng	Mary would've done that already if she could've.
6413797	eng	Mary would just like to know what she did wrong.
6413798	eng	Mary won't talk to Tom and he won't talk to her.
6413799	eng	Mary won't stay here as long you think she will.
6413800	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom she wants to do that.
6413801	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom she doesn't like him.
6413802	eng	Mary won't likely be able to do that by herself.
6413803	eng	Mary won't find anybody who'll help her do that.
6413804	eng	Mary won't be as busy tomorrow as she was today.
6413805	eng	Mary won't be able to move the piano by herself.
6413806	eng	Mary won't be able to do what we want her to do.
6413807	eng	Mary won't admit that she's done anything wrong.
6413808	eng	Mary wished that she had enough money to retire.
6413809	eng	Mary will probably get injured if she does that.
6413810	eng	Mary will probably be hungry when she gets home.
6413811	eng	Mary will probably be hungry when she gets here.
6413812	eng	Mary will probably be forgiven for what she did.
6413813	eng	Mary will get in trouble if she doesn't do that.
6413814	eng	Mary will explain it to you when she comes back.
6413815	eng	Mary will be in prison for the rest of her life.
6413816	eng	Mary went to Boston, but she didn't go by plane.
6413817	eng	Mary wasn't very hungry, so she didn't eat much.
6413818	eng	Mary wasn't surprised who showed up to meet her.
6413819	eng	Mary wasn't sure whether she should sing or not.

6413824	eng	Mary was thirsty, so she drank a glass of water.
6413825	eng	Mary was shocked when she saw Tom kissing Alice.
6413826	eng	Mary was reading a book the last time I saw her.
6413827	eng	Mary was lucky she didn't get seriously injured.
6413828	eng	Mary was going to ask Tom to eat lunch with her.
6413829	eng	Mary was fatter three years ago than she is now.
6413830	eng	Mary was convinced that Tom no longer loved her.
6413831	eng	Mary was aware that everyone was looking at her.

6413838	eng	Mary wanted me to tell you she can't come today.
6413839	eng	Mary wanted me to play chess with her, so I did.
6413840	eng	Mary usually helps anyone who asks her for help.
6413841	eng	Mary tried to tell Tom that she didn't like him.
6413842	eng	Mary tried to persuade Tom to come to her party.
6413843	eng	Mary tried to kiss Tom, but she pushed him away.
6413844	eng	Mary tried to kiss Tom, but he wouldn't let her.
6413845	eng	Mary tried to help Tom, but he wouldn't let her.
6413846	eng	Mary took a breath and tried to compose herself.
6413847	eng	Mary told us she wouldn't come back before 2:30.

6414334	eng	Mary assured me that she wouldn't do that again.
6414335	eng	Mary assured Tom that she'd never do that again.
6414336	eng	Mary asked me to help her find her contact lens.
6414337	eng	Mary asked Tom where he should put her suitcase.
6414338	eng	Mary asked Tom to teach her how to do the waltz.
6414339	eng	Mary asked Tom the same question she'd asked me.
6414340	eng	Mary asked Tom if he could give her a ride home.
6414341	eng	Mary almost forgot to take an umbrella with her.
6414342	eng	Mary almost always does what she promises to do.
6414343	eng	Mary admitted that she was the one who did that.
6414344	eng	Let's talk to Mary and find out what she thinks.
6414345	eng	Let's hope that Mary can handle that by herself.
6414346	eng	Let's ask Mary if she knows how to speak French.
6414347	eng	It's not necessary for Mary to go there herself.
6414348	eng	Is it necessary for Mary to go there by herself?
6414349	eng	If Mary was angry before, she'll be furious now.
6414350	eng	If Mary drops by, please give her this document.
6414351	eng	If Mary doesn't want to go, she doesn't have to.
6414352	eng	I've given Mary everything she's ever asked for.
6414353	eng	I've already told Mary why she needs to do that.
6414354	eng	I'm sure Mary will be hungry when she gets home.
6414355	eng	I'm sure Mary will be able take care of herself.
6414356	eng	I'll tell Mary she's got nothing to worry about.
6414357	eng	I wonder if Mary was able to do that by herself.
6414358	eng	I wonder if Mary really knew she should do that.
6414359	eng	I wish that Mary would tell me where she's been.
6414360	eng	I wish Mary wouldn't do that by herself anymore.
6414361	eng	I told Mary that she shouldn't drink that water.
6414362	eng	I told Mary that she should buy the cheaper one.
6414363	eng	I told Mary it was dangerous for her to do that.
6414364	eng	I told Mary I couldn't do that without her help.
6414365	eng	I thought Mary would be shocked, but she wasn't.
6414366	eng	I thought Mary would be at home, but she wasn't.
6414367	eng	I thought Mary said she wasn't ready to do that.
6414368	eng	I thought Mary might need to do that by herself.
6414369	eng	I thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
6414370	eng	I think you ought to let Mary do what she wants.
6414371	eng	I think you need to tell Mary that you love her.
6414372	eng	I think Mary would've come if you'd invited her.
6414373	eng	I think Mary will be able to do that by herself.
6414374	eng	I think Mary was supposed to do that by herself.
6414375	eng	I think Mary could leave today if she wanted to.
6414376	eng	I shouldn't have told Mary how I felt about her.
6414377	eng	I should've told Mary why she needed to do that.
6414378	eng	I knew Mary wouldn't want to do that by herself.
6414379	eng	I knew Mary wouldn't do what we asked her to do.
6414380	eng	I just told Mary what time she needs to be here.
6414381	eng	I gave Mary something that I thought she'd like.
6414382	eng	I forgot to remind Mary that she had to do that.
6414383	eng	I don't want to bother Mary while she's working.
6414384	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she's going to do.
6414385	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she should do yet.
6414386	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she has to do yet.
6414387	eng	I don't think Mary knows how much Tom loves her.
6414388	eng	I don't believe Mary really did that by herself.
6414389	eng	I didn't think Mary would be drunk, but she was.
6414390	eng	I didn't recognize Mary the last time I saw her.
6414391	eng	I didn't know Mary wanted to do that by herself.
6414392	eng	I didn't know Mary needed to do that by herself.
6414393	eng	I didn't allow Mary to do what she wanted to do.
6414394	eng	I asked Mary why she thought that was important.
6414395	eng	I asked Mary if she could have it ready by 2:30.
6414396	eng	Have you ever asked Mary why she didn't do that?
6414397	eng	Has Mary ever told you why she doesn't like Tom?
6414398	eng	Go wake Mary up and tell her breakfast is ready.
6414399	eng	Every time I see Mary, she's wearing sunglasses.
6414400	eng	Does Mary still do that as often as she used to?
6414401	eng	Does Mary know what she's going to do next year?
6414402	eng	Do you think that Mary can take care of herself?
6414403	eng	Do you really think Mary can do that by herself?
6414404	eng	Do you know Mary well enough to ask her to help?
6414405	eng	Did you tell Mary why you wanted her to do that?
6414406	eng	Did you tell Mary when we expect her to be here?
6414407	eng	Did you ask Mary why she didn't want to do that?
6414408	eng	Did Mary tell you she was having money problems?
6414409	eng	Did Mary say why she wanted to borrow the truck?
6414410	eng	Did Mary say she didn't think we should do that?
6414411	eng	Did Mary say she didn't think we had to do that?
6414412	eng	Did Mary remember to do what we asked her to do?
6414413	eng	Could Mary really be as busy as she says she is?
6414414	eng	Ask Mary if she has anybody to help her do that.
6414415	eng	You told Mary that she was adopted, didn't you?
6414416	eng	You told Mary she couldn't do that, didn't you?
6414417	eng	You should've told Mary why she had to do that.
6414418	eng	You should tell Mary why you disagree with her.
6414419	eng	You should tell Mary that she ought to do that.
6414420	eng	You should tell Mary that she needs to do that.
6414421	eng	You should tell Mary that Tom doesn't like her.
6414422	eng	You asked Mary why she'd done that, didn't you?
6414423	eng	Will Mary really be able to do that by herself?
6414424	eng	Why would Mary insist that Tom do that for her?
6414425	eng	Why should Mary do that if she doesn't have to?
6414426	eng	Why do you think Mary won't do that by herself?
6414427	eng	Who did Mary think would pay her bills for her?
6414428	eng	When Mary found out the truth, she was furious.
6414429	eng	When I first met Mary, she was still a student.
6414430	eng	When I first met Mary, she was just a teenager.
6414431	eng	What would Mary say if she walked in right now?
6414432	eng	What time did Mary say she wanted to get there?
6414433	eng	What movie did Mary tell you she wanted to see?
6414434	eng	What game did Mary tell you she wanted to play?
6414435	eng	What did Mary say she was going to do tomorrow?
6414436	eng	We'll ask Mary what she thinks when we see her.
6414437	eng	We need to make sure Mary doesn't hurt herself.
6414438	eng	Was it you who told Mary she shouldn't do that?
6414439	eng	Was it you who told Mary she needed to do that?
6414440	eng	Since Mary is sick, I'm sure she won't do that.
6414441	eng	Please tell Mary she can come back after lunch.
6414442	eng	Perhaps Mary would like you to do that for her.
6414443	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know what she did was wrong.
6414444	eng	Mary's parents let her do what she wants to do.
6414445	eng	Mary's not coming, because I don't want her to.
6414446	eng	Mary's dog woke her up a little after midnight.
6414447	eng	Mary's doctor advised her to get more exercise.
6414448	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me why she wouldn't do that.
6414449	eng	Mary wouldn't like it if Tom tried to kiss her.
6414450	eng	Mary wouldn't do that the way you said she did.
6414451	eng	Mary wouldn't be here if she didn't have to be.
6414452	eng	Mary would've succeeded if she'd worked harder.
6414453	eng	Mary would've gone with us if we'd invited her.
6414454	eng	Mary would stop doing that if you asked her to.
6414455	eng	Mary would stop doing that if Tom asked her to.
6414456	eng	Mary would make Tom very happy if she did that.
6414457	eng	Mary would like you to show her how to do that.
6414458	eng	Mary would do that for Tom if he wanted her to.
6414459	eng	Mary would be furious if she knew what you did.
6414460	eng	Mary wondered if she should tell Tom the truth.
6414461	eng	Mary wondered if Tom was as nervous as she was.
6414462	eng	Mary won't find anyone who'll help her do that.
6414463	eng	Mary won't find anybody who'll do that for her.
6414464	eng	Mary won't be able to move the desk by herself.
6414465	eng	Mary won't be able to lift that box by herself.
6414466	eng	Mary won't be able to do that while she's sick.
6414467	eng	Mary wished that Tom would tell her what to do.
6414468	eng	Mary wished she hadn't promised Tom she'd help.
6414469	eng	Mary wished she could understand French better.
6414470	eng	Mary will unlikely enjoy doing that by herself.
6414471	eng	Mary will probably be tired when she gets home.
6414472	eng	Mary will do that later when she's not so busy.
6414473	eng	Mary will be very sorry if she doesn't do that.
6414474	eng	Mary will ask Tom to do that for us, won't she?
6414475	eng	Mary went to the hospital because she was sick.
6414476	eng	Mary wasn't sure that she'd ever see Tom again.
6414477	eng	Mary wasn't able to do what we asked her to do.

6414498	eng	Mary wanted Tom to wait for her at the library.
6414499	eng	Mary used to love Tom. Now she can't stand him.
6414500	eng	Mary tried to persuade Tom to sell her his car.
6414501	eng	Mary tried to figure out the answer by herself.

6414988	eng	It's necessary for Mary to talk to Tom herself.
6414989	eng	Is it necessary for Mary to do that by herself?
6414990	eng	I've already given Mary what she really wanted.
6414991	eng	I'm sure Mary will be tired when she gets home.
6414992	eng	I'm sure Mary appreciated what you did for her.
6414993	eng	I'm pretty sure Mary did what she said she did.
6414994	eng	I'm looking for Mary. Do you know where she is?
6414995	eng	I'm going over to Mary's to ask her to help us.
6414996	eng	I'll buy whatever Mary wants me to buy for her.
6414997	eng	I wouldn't forgive Mary even if she apologized.
6414998	eng	I wonder why Mary didn't want Tom at her party.
6414999	eng	I wonder whether Mary's friends would help her.
6415000	eng	I wonder whether Mary can take care of herself.
6415001	eng	I was surprised when Mary told me she loved me.
6415002	eng	I was looking for Mary, but she found me first.
6415003	eng	I want to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
6415004	eng	I told Mary that she should do that by herself.
6415005	eng	I told Mary I wanted her to come here tomorrow.
6415006	eng	I told Mary I thought she was wasting her time.
6415007	eng	I thought Mary would figure it out for herself.
6415008	eng	I thought Mary was wasting her time doing that.
6415009	eng	I thought Mary said she needed to buy a shovel.
6415010	eng	I think you should tell Mary that you love her.
6415011	eng	I think you should let Mary do that by herself.
6415012	eng	I think Mary would like you to do that for her.
6415013	eng	I think Mary would do that if you asked her to.
6415014	eng	I think Mary would be forgiven if she did that.
6415015	eng	I think Mary will be hungry when she gets home.
6415016	eng	I think Mary said she's already read this book.
6415017	eng	I think Mary knows she needs to help Tom today.
6415018	eng	I think Mary is sure that's what she has to do.
6415019	eng	I think Mary did exactly what she said she did.
6415020	eng	I think Mary came to Boston when she was young.
6415021	eng	I suggest you let Mary do what she wants to do.
6415022	eng	I should probably tell Mary what she has to do.
6415023	eng	I promised Mary that I'd go to Boston with her.
6415024	eng	I never even got to tell Mary that I loved her.
6415025	eng	I looked around for Mary, but I didn't see her.
6415026	eng	I hope Mary sings the song I asked her to sing.
6415027	eng	I hope Mary likes the present I bought for her.
6415028	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what you asked her to do.
6415029	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what Tom asked her to do.
6415030	eng	I haven't seen Mary since she and Tom broke up.
6415031	eng	I have a feeling Mary can take care of herself.
6415032	eng	I don't think Mary wants to do that by herself.
6415033	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom is mad at her.
6415034	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she needs to buy.
6415035	eng	I don't think Mary knows that I don't like her.
6415036	eng	I don't know how Mary did that, but she did it.
6415037	eng	I don't believe Mary did what Tom said she did.
6415038	eng	I didn't think Mary would do that, but she did.
6415039	eng	I didn't tell Mary why I wanted her to do that.
6415040	eng	I didn't tell Mary what she was supposed to do.
6415041	eng	I didn't really think Mary did that by herself.
6415042	eng	I didn't do what Mary said she wanted me to do.
6415043	eng	I convinced Mary to lie about where she'd been.
6415044	eng	How did Mary react when she saw Tom doing that?
6415045	eng	How did Mary get Tom to give her so much money?
6415046	eng	Has Mary told you why she doesn't want to stay?
6415047	eng	Find Mary and tell her to come here right away.
6415048	eng	Does Mary think she'll be in Boston all summer?
6415049	eng	Do you think Mary will let Tom do that for her?
6415050	eng	Do you really think Mary will let you help her?
6415051	eng	Do you have any idea why Mary did what she did?
6415052	eng	Did you tell Mary she could go see Tom tonight?
6415053	eng	Did you ask Mary why she wasn't here yesterday?
6415054	eng	Did you ask Mary why she wasn't at the meeting?
6415055	eng	Did Mary tell you about what she did last week?
6415056	eng	Did Mary say she thought she needed to do that?
6415057	eng	Did Mary ever tell you why she never remarried?
6415058	eng	Ask Mary whether she's going to do that or not.
6415059	eng	Ask Mary if she has anyone to help her do that.
6415060	eng	All Mary wanted was for Tom to leave her alone.
6415061	eng	You should just let Mary cry herself to sleep.
6415062	eng	You can't exactly blame Mary for what she did.
6415063	eng	Why would Mary do that if she doesn't have to?
6415064	eng	Who's going to tell Mary she can't go with us?
6415065	eng	Who did Mary think would lend her an umbrella?
6415066	eng	Who did Mary say she wanted to go skiing with?
6415067	eng	When I told Mary I'd done that, she got angry.
6415068	eng	When I first met Mary, I didn't like her much.
6415069	eng	What was Mary doing the last time you saw her?
6415070	eng	What time did Mary tell you she'd be arriving?
6415071	eng	What do you want me to tell Mary if she calls?
6415072	eng	What did you tell Mary she was supposed to do?
6415073	eng	What did you tell Mary she was expected to do?
6415074	eng	What did Mary tell you she was supposed to do?
6415075	eng	What did Mary tell you she was expected to do?
6415076	eng	We're not going to leave Mary here by herself.
6415077	eng	We need to stop Mary before she hurts herself.
6415078	eng	We can't let Mary walk. Let's give her a ride.
6415079	eng	We all hope Mary does what she says she'll do.
6415080	eng	Was it you who told Mary she ought to do that?
6415081	eng	Was it you who told Mary she needs to do that?
6415082	eng	This is where Mary stays when she's in Boston.
6415083	eng	Tell Mary to get back here as soon as she can.
6415084	eng	Tell Mary Tom is waiting for her in the lobby.
6415085	eng	Since Mary was sick, she went to the hospital.
6415086	eng	Since Mary was sick, she couldn't go swimming.
6415087	eng	Please tell Mary what you think she should do.
6415088	eng	Please tell Mary she needs to be here by 2:30.
6415089	eng	Perhaps Mary knows more than she's telling us.
6415090	eng	One of Mary's problems is that she can't read.
6415091	eng	None of Mary's classmates offered to help her.
6415092	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know what she needs to buy.
6415093	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know she shouldn't do that.
6415094	eng	Mary's still taking her medication, isn't she?
6415095	eng	Mary's parents let her stay out late at night.
6415096	eng	Mary's parents are probably worried about her.
6415097	eng	Mary's parents allow her to do what she wants.
6415098	eng	Mary's mother told her not to jump on her bed.
6415099	eng	Mary's friends knew she couldn't speak French.
6415100	eng	Mary's friends asked her to come out and play.
6415101	eng	Mary's father doesn't allow her to drink wine.
6415102	eng	Mary's doctor advised her to give up drinking.
6415103	eng	Mary's at the door. Please ask her to come in.
6415104	eng	Mary wouldn't tell us where she hid the money.
6415105	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me why she didn't like Tom.
6415106	eng	Mary wouldn't tell Tom why she didn't do that.
6415107	eng	Mary wouldn't let anybody do anything for her.
6415108	eng	Mary wouldn't be happy if we made her do that.
6415109	eng	Mary would've succeeded if she'd tried harder.
6415110	eng	Mary would tell me if she wasn't happy, right?
6415111	eng	Mary would often do that when she was younger.
6415112	eng	Mary would never do that when she was younger.
6415113	eng	Mary would lend you money if you asked her to.
6415114	eng	Mary would leave early if she were allowed to.
6415115	eng	Mary wondered why everyone was staring at her.
6415116	eng	Mary wondered why Tom didn't want to help her.
6415117	eng	Mary won't likely tell Tom what she has to do.
6415118	eng	Mary won't likely enjoy doing that by herself.
6415119	eng	Mary won't know we're here unless we tell her.
6415120	eng	Mary won't find anyone who'll do that for her.
6415121	eng	Mary won't admit it, but she's in big trouble.
6415122	eng	Mary wished she hadn't told Tom she loved him.
6415123	eng	Mary will unlikely want to do that by herself.
6415124	eng	Mary will unlikely need to do that by herself.
6415125	eng	Mary will unlikely have to do that by herself.
6415126	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom what he has to do.
6415127	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she won't do that.
6415128	eng	Mary will probably get fined if she does that.
6415129	eng	Mary will never be able to do that by herself.
6415130	eng	Mary will miss the train if she doesn't hurry.
6415131	eng	Mary will likely be punished for what she did.
6415132	eng	Mary will likely be hungry when she gets home.
6415133	eng	Mary will help you do that if you want her to.
6415134	eng	Mary will help Tom do that if she asks her to.
6415135	eng	Mary will have to take better care of herself.
6415136	eng	Mary will come back home when she gets hungry.
6415137	eng	Mary will be living in Boston with her father.
6415138	eng	Mary went back to where she'd met Tom earlier.
6415139	eng	Mary went back to her car to get her umbrella.
6415140	eng	Mary wasn't convinced that she had to do that.
6415141	eng	Mary wasn't able to eat as much she wanted to.
6415142	eng	Mary wasn't able to do anything she had to do.
6415143	eng	Mary wasn't able to buy everything she needed.
6415144	eng	Mary was upset when she saw Tom kissing Alice.
6415145	eng	Mary was unable to do what we asked her to do.
6415146	eng	Mary was surprised when she saw Tom in Boston.
6415147	eng	Mary was so tired she didn't even want to eat.
6415148	eng	Mary was shocked when I told her what Tom did.
6415149	eng	Mary was paid thirty dollars for what she did.
6415150	eng	Mary was hoping she could go sailing with Tom.
6415151	eng	Mary was dancing by herself on the back porch.
6415152	eng	Mary was convinced that she needed to do that.
6415153	eng	Mary was born in Boston and she grew up there.
6415154	eng	Mary was able to solve the problem by herself.
6415155	eng	Mary was a bit surprised by what Tom told her.
6415156	eng	Mary wants to get somebody to do that for her.
6415157	eng	Mary wanted to live close to where she worked.

6415168	eng	Mary used to do that, but she doesn't anymore.
6415169	eng	Mary used to do that better than she does now.
6415170	eng	Mary used the money I gave her to buy a bicycle.
6415171	eng	Mary tried to open the door, but she couldn't.
6415172	eng	Mary tried to leave, but Tom wouldn't let her.
6415173	eng	Mary tried to do that, but she wasn't able to.
6415174	eng	Mary tried to convince Tom that she'd changed.
6415175	eng	Mary tried to convince Tom that she was right.
6415176	eng	Mary tried not to think about what she'd done.
6415177	eng	Mary took something that didn't belong to her.
6415178	eng	Mary took off her jacket and handed it to Tom.

6415839	eng	I never told Mary what she was supposed to do.

6415852	eng	I don't really think Mary did that by herself.
6415853	eng	I don't know why Mary does that, but she does.
6415854	eng	I don't believe Mary can take care of herself.
6415855	eng	I didn't think Mary would ask Tom to help her.
6415856	eng	How did Mary know what she was supposed to do?

6416650	eng	Ask Mary if she wants to go swimming with us.
6416651	eng	Are you going to tell Mary that you love her?
6416652	eng	You'd better tell Mary what she needs to do.

6416659	eng	Where did Mary say she thought we should go?

6417319	eng	It's necessary for Mary to go there herself.
6417320	eng	If you see Mary, could you give this to her?
6417321	eng	If Mary had been here, she'd have helped us.
6417322	eng	I've already told Mary what she needs to do.
6417323	eng	I've already told Mary she needs to do that.
6417324	eng	I'm sure that Mary can take care of herself.
6417325	eng	I'm sure Mary will do what we ask her to do.
6417326	eng	I'm not sure Mary would let anyone help her.
6417327	eng	I'm convinced Mary can take care of herself.
6417328	eng	I'll tell Mary what you want me to tell her.
6417329	eng	I'd better ask Mary and see what she thinks.
6417330	eng	I wonder why Mary said she doesn't know Tom.
6417331	eng	I wonder why Mary didn't do that by herself.
6417332	eng	I wonder if Mary thought she had to do that.
6417333	eng	I wonder if Mary really meant what she said.
6417334	eng	I wonder if Mary knew she needed to do that.
6417335	eng	I wonder if Mary did what she said she'd do.
6417336	eng	I wish I'd never told Mary that I loved her.
6417337	eng	I tried to hug Mary, but she pushed me away.
6417338	eng	I told Mary to do that as soon as she could.
6417339	eng	I told Mary that she shouldn't eat raw pork.

6417345	eng	I told Mary not to sing while she's working.
6417346	eng	I told Mary I couldn't play tennis with her.
6417347	eng	I think you should ask Mary what she thinks.
6417348	eng	I think if Mary tried to do that, she could.
6417349	eng	I think Mary has never done that by herself.
6417350	eng	I think Mary could do that if she wanted to.
6417351	eng	I think I heard Mary say that she'd do that.
6417352	eng	I should've just given Mary what she wanted.
6417353	eng	I should've asked Mary if she could do that.
6417354	eng	I should tell Mary why Tom doesn't like her.
6417355	eng	I saw Mary looking at herself in the mirror.
6417356	eng	I know Mary will have to do that on her own.
6417357	eng	I know Mary didn't do what you said she did.
6417358	eng	I knew Mary wouldn't get the job she wanted.
6417359	eng	I hope Mary knows when she needs to do that.
6417360	eng	I hope Mary did what she was supposed to do.
6417361	eng	I doubt that Mary could get home by herself.
6417362	eng	I don't think Mary would've swum by herself.
6417363	eng	I don't think Mary would do that by herself.
6417364	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she'll do yet.
6417365	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she has to do.
6417366	eng	I don't think Mary knows that she's adopted.
6417367	eng	I don't think Mary has everything she wants.
6417368	eng	I don't think Mary has everything she needs.
6417369	eng	I don't think Mary did what you say she did.
6417370	eng	I don't think Mary can take care of herself.
6417371	eng	I don't know why Mary did that, but she did.
6417372	eng	I don't know how Mary did that, but she did.
6417373	eng	I don't believe Mary can do that by herself.
6417374	eng	I do hope Mary does what she says she'll do.
6417375	eng	I didn't tell Mary why she had to work late.
6417376	eng	I didn't know Mary could do that by herself.
6417377	eng	I couldn't just leave Mary there by herself.

6417384	eng	Have you told Mary why she needs to do that?
6417385	eng	Have you told Mary what she should be doing?
6417386	eng	Don't laugh at Mary when she makes mistakes.
6417387	eng	Does Mary think she doesn't need to do that?
6417388	eng	Does Mary think she doesn't have to do that?
6417389	eng	Does Mary know we don't want her to do that?

6417400	eng	Both of Mary's brothers are taller than her.
6417401	eng	Ask Mary if she's willing to work part-time.
6417402	eng	Ask Mary and she'll tell you the same thing.
6417403	eng	Ask Mary about it the next time you see her.
6417404	eng	Why would Mary need Tom to do that for her?
6417405	eng	Why should Mary ask Tom to do that for her?
6417406	eng	Why did Mary stop doing what she was doing?
6417407	eng	Where did Mary stay when she was in Boston?
6417408	eng	When you see Mary, please give this to her.
6417409	eng	When does Mary want me to help her do that?
6417410	eng	When Mary left, I told her she'd come back.
6417411	eng	When I told Mary I'd done that, she smiled.
6417412	eng	When I first met Mary, she was a bartender.
6417413	eng	What time did Mary say she wanted to leave?
6417414	eng	What did Mary tell you she wanted to drink?
6417415	eng	We must stop Mary before she hurts herself.
6417416	eng	Wasn't Mary supposed to do that by herself?
6417417	eng	Was Mary really able to do that by herself?
6417418	eng	This is the room where Mary killed herself.

6420440	eng	Mary did that intentionally, didn't she?
6420441	eng	Mary did that because she was forced to.
6420442	eng	Mary did that because she had no choice.
6420443	eng	Mary did more than what we asked her to.

6420459	eng	Mary could've helped me, but she didn't.
6420460	eng	Mary could've done that, but she didn't.
6420461	eng	Mary could get punished if she did that.
6420462	eng	Mary could do a lot better if she tried.
6420463	eng	Mary could come with me if she wants to.

6420496	eng	Mary apologized to Tom for what she did.
6420497	eng	Mary apologized to Tom for her rudeness.
6420498	eng	Mary always does that when she's scared.
6420499	eng	Mary always carries her camera with her.
6420500	eng	Mary already knows what she needs to do.
6420501	eng	Mary almost told Tom that she loved him.
6420502	eng	Mary almost always does that by herself.

6420534	eng	I reminded Mary that she had to do that.
6420535	eng	I really wish Mary would behave herself.
6420536	eng	I let Mary do that anytime she wants to.
6420537	eng	I know that Mary expects me to help her.
6420538	eng	I know Mary would leave if we'd let her.
6420539	eng	I knew Mary wouldn't do that by herself.

6420542	eng	I hope Mary did what we asked her to do.
6420543	eng	I hope Mary did what Tom told her to do.

6420545	eng	I heard Mary say she needed to find Tom.
6420546	eng	I expected Mary to call, but she didn't.

6420579	eng	Call Mary and tell her we're on our way.
6420580	eng	All Mary wanted was someone to love her.
6420581	eng	All I did was ask Mary if she was happy.
6420582	eng	You should let Mary decide for herself.
6420583	eng	Why don't you call Mary and remind her?
6420584	eng	Why don't you ask Mary what she thinks?
6420585	eng	Why did Mary say she wanted to do that?
6420586	eng	Who did Mary say was going to help her?
6420587	eng	Where did Mary live when she was a kid?
6420588	eng	When did Mary tell you she was leaving?
6420589	eng	What did Mary say she expected to find?
6420590	eng	We'll need to ask Mary what she thinks.
6420591	eng	We'll ask Mary and see what she thinks.
6420592	eng	This is where Mary told us to meet her.
6420593	eng	This is just what Mary said she wanted.
6420594	eng	That looks like Mary, but it isn't her.
6420595	eng	Tell Mary she should go back to Boston.

6420631	eng	Mary will never admit that she's wrong.
6420632	eng	Mary will have to do it all by herself.
6420633	eng	Mary will give me that if I ask her to.

6431261	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is aware that Mary has been arrested.
6431262	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive your car again.
6431263	eng	How many women have you talked to since you got out of prison?
6431264	eng	How many hours a week do you help out at the homeless shelter?
6431265	eng	You really should lie to Tom about where you were last night.
6431266	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in front of the library at 2:30.
6431267	eng	Tom was walking so fast that Mary couldn't catch up with him.
6431268	eng	Tom texted Mary to let her know that he'd be late for dinner.
6431269	eng	Tom said something to Mary, but I couldn't hear what he said.
6431270	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
6431271	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was always in her office on Mondays.
6431272	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who wanted to do that.
6431273	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who needed to do that.
6431274	eng	Tom said he thought I might be required to do that by myself.
6431275	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to eat anything she didn't want to.
6431276	eng	Tom promised me he'd buy me something to eat on the way home.
6431277	eng	Tom noticed Mary's new hairstyle, but he didn't say anything.
6431278	eng	Tom knows you didn't eat any of the cookies he baked for you.
6431279	eng	Tom knew Mary was looking for him, so he hid in the basement.
6431280	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431281	eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to drive.
6431282	eng	Tom is probably going to figure out it was Mary who did that.
6431283	eng	Tom is going to have to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?
6431284	eng	Tom is going to buy his mother some flowers for Mother's Day.
6431285	eng	Tom is going to be the first one in our class to get married.
6431286	eng	Tom is going to be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
6431287	eng	Tom has been looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431288	eng	Tom couldn't help us today, because he was busy helping Mary.
6431289	eng	Tom and Mary talked on the phone with each other all evening.
6431290	eng	Tom and Mary take a walk together after dinner every evening.
6431291	eng	Tom and Mary started doing that when they were both thirteen.
6431292	eng	Tom and Mary helped their mother decorate the Christmas tree.
6431293	eng	That's an interesting idea, but I don't think we can do that.
6431294	eng	Mary doesn't like it when her boyfriend kisses her in public.
6431295	eng	Mary called her mother and told her she'd be late for dinner.
6431296	eng	It's going to take Tom three hours to finish what he's doing.
6431297	eng	It's going to be difficult to complete this report by Monday.
6431298	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, please wait on the porch.
6431299	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't want to drive.
6431300	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431301	eng	I don't think Tom has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
6431302	eng	I don't have to go into the office until 2:30 this afternoon.
6431303	eng	Apparently, that's the only way we can get that done in time.
6431304	eng	Tom will probably feel better once he gets something to eat.
6431305	eng	Tom was supposed to meet me in the lobby, but he never came.
6431306	eng	Tom was shocked when he learned that Mary had been arrested.
6431307	eng	Tom wanted to do that this afternoon, but I told him not to.
6431308	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't eat the stew if it had pork in it.
6431309	eng	Tom thought that the best solution was to ask Mary to leave.
6431310	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wanted to do that.
6431311	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary needed to do that.
6431312	eng	Tom said he wanted me to help him paint his garage tomorrow.
6431313	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that this afternoon.
6431314	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be in Boston for three weeks.
6431315	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might want to walk home by herself.
6431316	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to walk home by herself.
6431317	eng	Tom said he thought I might be allowed to do that by myself.
6431318	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to eat anything she doesn't like.
6431319	eng	Tom refused to tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431320	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6431321	eng	Tom is probably going to ask Mary for permission to do that.
6431322	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do this.
6431323	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do that.
6431324	eng	Tom is likely going to be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6431325	eng	Tom is going to keep doing that if someone doesn't stop him.
6431326	eng	Tom is going to get into trouble if he eats all the cookies.
6431327	eng	Tom is going to get in trouble if he eats all the ice cream.
6431328	eng	Tom is going to get himself killed if he's not more careful.
6431329	eng	Tom is going to be staying with us for the next three weeks.
6431330	eng	Tom decided not to tell his parents about what had happened.
6431331	eng	Tom called to let me know he wouldn't be coming to my party.
6431332	eng	Tom and Mary will be leaving for Australia tomorrow morning.
6431333	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never going to see each other again.
6431334	eng	There's something on that shelf that both Tom and Mary want.
6431335	eng	The weather's nice and it's my day off, so I'm going hiking.
6431336	eng	The picnic was held in the gymnasium because it was raining.
6431337	eng	Ninety percent of the time Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
6431338	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom was ready to become a father.
6431339	eng	If Tom doesn't get an A on the test, his mother will be mad.
6431340	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you've never done that.
6431341	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't speak French.
6431342	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you eat his piece of cake.
6431343	eng	How many times a week does Tom help at the homeless shelter?
6431344	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431345	eng	Tom would've let you drive if you'd told him you wanted to.
6431346	eng	Tom will tell Mary everything he knows about the situation.
6431347	eng	Tom will lose his job if he keeps showing up late for work.
6431348	eng	Tom was playing basketball this afternoon with his friends.
6431349	eng	Tom was hoping Mary wouldn't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431350	eng	Tom tried to pick up Mary's suitcase, but it was too heavy.
6431351	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably in the cafeteria, eating lunch.
6431352	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wouldn't do that.
6431353	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary had been told not to do that.
6431354	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she was supposed to do.
6431355	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still waiting in the lobby.
6431356	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
6431357	eng	Tom said he thought there was a chance that Mary would win.
6431358	eng	Tom said he thought he might be permitted to do that today.
6431359	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the first one to do that.
6431360	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be interested in doing that.
6431361	eng	Tom said he thought Mary seemed to be desperate to do that.
6431362	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that anymore.
6431363	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that anymore.
6431364	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to eat Chinese food this evening.
6431365	eng	Tom recognized Mary as soon as she walked through the door.
6431366	eng	Tom is probably going to get hurt if he does that that way.
6431367	eng	Tom is probably going to be ready by the time we get there.
6431368	eng	Tom is probably going to be drunk by the time we get there.
6431369	eng	Tom is never going to understand why people don't like him.
6431370	eng	Tom is never going to live up to his parents' expectations.
6431371	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without your help.
6431372	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without some help.
6431373	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that before lunch.
6431374	eng	Tom is going to help you as soon as he finishes doing that.
6431375	eng	Tom is going to have to do that even if he doesn't want to.
6431376	eng	Tom is going to be staying at the Hilton Hotel next Monday.

6431383	eng	Tom announced that he'd be retiring at the end of the year.
6431384	eng	Tom and Mary were supposed to meet each other in the lobby.
6431385	eng	Tom and Mary say they want to have at least three children.
6431386	eng	Tom and Mary have three children under the age of thirteen.
6431387	eng	The only language I can speak other than French is English.
6431388	eng	It's just not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431389	eng	It's hard to believe that Tom would do something like that.
6431390	eng	It's going to take some time to finish unloading the truck.
6431391	eng	It's going to take a little time to get used to doing this.
6431392	eng	It's going to be a long time before I try doing that again.
6431393	eng	It wasn't clear on Monday whether Tom would do that or not.
6431394	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, just wait on the porch.
6431395	eng	I wouldn't have done that if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431396	eng	I was the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431397	eng	I have a sore throat, so I don't know if I can sing or not.
6431398	eng	How much money will it cost us to get that book translated?
6431399	eng	How many more weeks do you think Tom will help us for free?
6431400	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take Tom to mow the lawn?
6431401	eng	How many hours do you think it took Tom paint this picture?
6431402	eng	How different is driving a truck compared to driving a car?
6431403	eng	Do you really have enough money to buy everything you want?
6431404	eng	Do you really have enough money to buy everything you need?
6431405	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary were going to be there.
6431406	eng	Tom wouldn't be helping us today if Mary hadn't asked him.
6431407	eng	Tom wished he hadn't asked Mary to teach him how to drive.
6431408	eng	Tom wasn't waiting for Mary where he said he'd be waiting.
6431409	eng	Tom was shocked when he heard that Mary had been arrested.
6431410	eng	Tom was only three years old when he first came to Boston.
6431411	eng	Tom wanted to remind Mary not to forget about the meeting.
6431412	eng	Tom wanted to explain everything to Mary, but he couldn't.
6431413	eng	Tom wanted to apologize to Mary, but he couldn't find her.
6431414	eng	Tom took care of Mary's daughter while Mary was in Boston.

6431421	eng	Tom shouted as loud as he could, but Mary didn't hear him.
6431422	eng	Tom saw Mary eating by hersalf at a table near the window.
6431423	eng	Tom said that he wasn't responsible for what had happened.
6431424	eng	Tom said that Mary looked like she was enjoying the party.
6431425	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be concerned about that.
6431426	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't attend this afternoon's meeting.
6431427	eng	Tom said that Mary could've probably done that by herself.
6431428	eng	Tom said he thought he might be required to do that today.
6431429	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the next one to do that.
6431430	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the last one to do that.
6431431	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the best singer in his class.
6431432	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who had to do that.
6431433	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that by myself.
6431434	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that by myself.
6431435	eng	Tom said he thought I might be permitted to do that today.
6431436	eng	Tom knows Mary will probably be hungry when she gets home.
6431437	eng	Tom knew that Mary would be drunk by the time he got home.
6431438	eng	Tom is probably not going to have any fun at Mary's party.
6431439	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that again.
6431440	eng	Tom is probably going to sing that new song he just wrote.
6431441	eng	Tom is probably going to go swimming again this afternoon.
6431442	eng	Tom is probably going to be very hungry when he gets home.
6431443	eng	Tom is probably going to be gone by the time we get there.
6431444	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without our help.
6431445	eng	Tom is likely going to spend the rest of his life in jail.
6431446	eng	Tom is going to try to find out why Mary wants to do that.
6431447	eng	Tom is going to try to convince Mary to accept your offer.
6431448	eng	Tom is going to talk to Mary about that when he gets here.

6431456	eng	Tom didn't want to help us today, but he helped us anyway.
6431457	eng	Tom convinced himself that what he was doing wasn't wrong.
6431458	eng	Tom and Mary will sit at the same table as John and Alice.
6431459	eng	Tom and Mary are unlikely to eat anything I make for them.
6431460	eng	Tom and Mary are going to eat dinner with us this evening.
6431461	eng	The table I'm planning to give away is in the living room.
6431462	eng	The police officer handcuffed Tom's hands behind his back.
6431463	eng	My parents died in an automobile accident three years ago.
6431464	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to finish this.
6431465	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
6431466	eng	In case of rain, the picnic will be held in the gymnasium.
6431467	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from boxing and returned to teaching.
6431468	eng	If you do that this way, you'll be able to save some time.
6431469	eng	I can't force you to do that, but you really should do it.
6431470	eng	How old were you when you and Tom first kissed each other?
6431471	eng	How much do you think I should pay Tom to rotate my tires?
6431472	eng	How much did Tom pay you to help him clean out his garage?
6431473	eng	Have you told Tom why he shouldn't be doing that that way?
6431474	eng	Even though it was raining, we went out for a walk anyway.
6431475	eng	Do you think Tom was the one who taught Mary how to drive?
6431476	eng	Could you tell me what time the meeting is going to start?
6431477	eng	When Tom told Mary that he'd kissed Alice, she got upset.
6431478	eng	Tom, Mary and their children went to Boston last weekend.
6431479	eng	Tom's house is a five-minute walk from the train station.
6431480	eng	Tom went into the kitchen to help his mother make dinner.
6431481	eng	Tom used the money Mary gave him to buy something to eat.
6431482	eng	Tom told me he wanted me to buy a couple of loaves bread.

6431496	eng	Tom said that Mary was responsible for what had happened.
6431497	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to go to Boston to see John.
6431498	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to cheer Mary up.
6431499	eng	Tom said he thought he might be allowed to do that today.

6431501	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be awake when he got home.
6431502	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the best player on the team.
6431503	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.

6431509	eng	Tom said he didn't think he was ready to become a father.
6431510	eng	Tom ought to tell Mary not to eat the fruit on that tree.
6431511	eng	Tom knows there are plenty of people who agree with Mary.
6431512	eng	Tom knew that Mary couldn't eat anything with nuts in it.
6431513	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary why he had to do that.
6431514	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary that he can't do that.
6431515	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he intends to do that.
6431516	eng	Tom is probably going to be very tired when he gets home.
6431517	eng	Tom is probably going to be in Boston two or three years.
6431518	eng	Tom is probably going to be able to answer your question.
6431519	eng	Tom is likely going to be retired by this time next year.
6431520	eng	Tom is going to have plenty of time to do that next week.
6431521	eng	Tom is going to have a party at his place Monday evening.
6431522	eng	Tom is going to go back to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6431523	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for Mary in the lobby at 2:30.
6431524	eng	Tom is going to be staying here with us for three months.
6431525	eng	Tom is almost certainly going to be at the party tonight.

6431527	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out how to make Mary happy.
6431528	eng	Tom has been on vacation with his family for a few weeks.
6431529	eng	Tom encouraged Mary to go to Boston to visit her parents.
6431530	eng	Tom didn't know Mary had eaten the whole cake by herself.

6431533	eng	Tom and Mary know John didn't eat breakfast this morning.
6431534	eng	Tom and Mary have been dating off and on for three years.
6431535	eng	The store you're talking about is located on Park Street.
6431536	eng	Please buy a couple of bottles of red wine for the party.
6431537	eng	It's going to be easy to find someone to do that for you.
6431538	eng	I've only met Mary once, but she seemed like a nice girl.
6431539	eng	I'm the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431540	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what Tom's phone number is.
6431541	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't like Mary.
6431542	eng	I heard that Tom will play tennis with us this afternoon.
6431543	eng	I haven't seen Tom since we were in high school together.
6431544	eng	I ended up telling Tom what Mary told me not to tell him.
6431545	eng	I don't like lying, but sometimes I think it's necessary.
6431546	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that with Mary.
6431547	eng	How much money do you estimate will be needed to do that?
6431548	eng	How much money do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6431549	eng	How long do you think it would take me to read this book?
6431550	eng	Do you think Tom will be able to teach Mary how to drive?

6431552	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary don't like chocolate?
6431553	eng	At the end of the 2013 season, Tom retired from football.
6431554	eng	Apparently, that's the only way Tom knows how to do that.
6431555	eng	You don't need to buy any sugar. We already have plenty.
6431556	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what the problem is?
6431557	eng	Where were you on October 20th at 2:30 in the afternoon?
6431558	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he started laughing.
6431559	eng	We've been waiting for you to tell us what we should do.
6431560	eng	Tom, Mary and John all live with their father in Boston.

6431564	eng	Tom used to hang up the laundry, but he doesn't anymore.

6431586	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
6431587	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be permitted to do that.
6431588	eng	Tom often sleeps on the train on his way home from work.
6431589	eng	Tom knew that Mary would be difficult to get along with.
6431590	eng	Tom is probably going to still be in Boston next Monday.
6431591	eng	Tom is probably going to get back from Boston on Monday.
6431592	eng	Tom is probably going to finish what he's doing by 2:30.
6431593	eng	Tom is most likely going to be the first one to show up.
6431594	eng	Tom is likely going to only sleep for about three hours.

6431605	eng	Tom has a French test tomorrow that he has to study for.
6431606	eng	Tom didn't know Mary would eat the whole pie by herself.
6431607	eng	Tom came to Boston for the first time when he was three.
6431608	eng	Tom and Mary were playing tennis together earlier today.
6431609	eng	Tom and Mary send each other Christmas cards every year.
6431610	eng	Tom and Mary moved to Boston and opened an antique shop.
6431611	eng	Tom and Mary had lunch together in the school cafeteria.
6431612	eng	Tom and Mary are leaving for Australia tomorrow morning.
6431613	eng	On my days off, I often sit in the park and read a book.
6431614	eng	Mary is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever met.
6431615	eng	Mary is a good-looking girl, but she's not too friendly.
6431616	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for you to do that.
6431617	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for Tom to do that.
6431618	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to living here.
6431619	eng	It's going to take me a long time to get over this cold.
6431620	eng	It's going to be impossible to do that, don't you think?
6431621	eng	It's going to be impossible for Tom to do that tomorrow.
6431622	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't see Mary kissing John.
6431623	eng	If you ask Tom to lend you some money, he probably will.
6431624	eng	I'd rather not lie to my parents about where we've been.
6431625	eng	I was waiting for you to tell me what needed to be done.
6431626	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom hang out with Mary anymore.
6431627	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure I want to marry him.
6431628	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that for Mary.
6431629	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to go to Boston with Mary.
6431630	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that for Mary.
6431631	eng	How much money will it cost to get that book translated?
6431632	eng	How much money do you estimate Tom will need to do that?
6431633	eng	How long do you think it would take you to mow our lawn?

6431636	eng	Do you know whether or not Tom will sing for us tonight?
6431637	eng	Are you certain it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?

6431639	eng	Tom's house is only about a five-minute walk from here.
6431640	eng	Tom would prefer to study French with a native speaker.
6431641	eng	Tom will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.
6431642	eng	Tom will be mad at Mary when he finds out what she did.
6431643	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.

6431645	eng	Tom told the police that he'd been mugged by three men.
6431646	eng	Tom told me that he and Mary were going to get married.
6431647	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted John to teach him how to drive.
6431648	eng	Tom told Mary he thought they should get back together.
6431649	eng	Tom says he needs to find somebody to do that for Mary.
6431650	eng	Tom said that he was very sure that Mary would do that.
6431651	eng	Tom said that he was responsible for what had happened.
6431652	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary liked him very much.
6431653	eng	Tom said that Mary has been told to do that many times.
6431654	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't eat either of her sandwiches.
6431655	eng	Tom said he'll be ready to go by the time you get here.
6431656	eng	Tom said he'd likely buy some stuff at the flea market.
6431657	eng	Tom said he was going to be in Boston for another week.

6431659	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6431660	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be motivated to do that.
6431661	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be desperate to do that.
6431662	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be bored if we did that.
6431663	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't through doing that yet.
6431664	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to be doing that.
6431665	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be required to do that.
6431666	eng	Tom said he thought I might be allowed to do that soon.
6431667	eng	Tom noticed Mary's car parked in front of John's house.
6431668	eng	Tom needed to go back to his house to get his passport.
6431669	eng	Tom left his apartment earlier this morning than usual.
6431670	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knows what happened to Mary.
6431671	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
6431672	eng	Tom isn't as interested in doing that as he used to be.
6431673	eng	Tom is trying to figure out how he can make Mary happy.
6431674	eng	Tom is probably going to walk to work tomorrow morning.
6431675	eng	Tom is probably going to to be excused from doing that.
6431676	eng	Tom is probably going to tell you the same thing I did.
6431677	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he'll never do that.
6431678	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he wants to do that.
6431679	eng	Tom is probably going to be present at today's meeting.
6431680	eng	Tom is probably going to be late for work this morning.
6431681	eng	Tom is probably going to be exhausted after doing that.
6431682	eng	Tom is never going to have to worry about going hungry.
6431683	eng	Tom is looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431684	eng	Tom is hoping Mary won't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431685	eng	Tom is going to try to finish writing the report today.
6431686	eng	Tom is going to take a walk in the park this afternoon.
6431687	eng	Tom is going to be out of the office until next Monday.
6431688	eng	Tom is going to be making more money than me this year.
6431689	eng	Tom has three children at home and one away at college.
6431690	eng	Tom has been Mary's next-door neighbor for three years.
6431691	eng	Tom has always had a problem with knowing when to stop.
6431692	eng	Tom gave me his notebook with all his favorite recipes.
6431693	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to and from work.
6431694	eng	Tom doesn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431695	eng	Tom doesn't like it when his wife kisses him in public.
6431696	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to eat dinner with her boss.
6431697	eng	Tom and Mary spent all morning discussing that problem.
6431698	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends I can talk to.
6431699	eng	Not only does Tom speak French, he also speaks English.
6431700	eng	My parents weren't the ones who taught me how to drive.
6431701	eng	My guess is that Tom won't do what you asked him to do.
6431702	eng	Mary shaves her legs more often than Alice shaves hers.
6431703	eng	Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning.
6431704	eng	It's going to take you at least three hours to do that.
6431705	eng	It's going to take us several weeks to finish this job.
6431706	eng	It's going to take three hours to finish these repairs.
6431707	eng	It's going to cost you a lot to furnish your apartment.
6431708	eng	If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
6431709	eng	I've only met Tom once, but she seemed like a nice guy.
6431710	eng	I'd grateful to you if you could teach me how to drive.
6431711	eng	I want to know if you know who broke my kitchen window.
6431712	eng	I used to see Tom jogging past my house in the morning.
6431713	eng	I thought flying to Boston would cost more than it did.
6431714	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you won't do that.
6431715	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't do that.
6431716	eng	I swore I'd never kiss Tom, but I ended up kissing him.
6431717	eng	I just don't know why Tom doesn't want me to help Mary.
6431718	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary have ever kissed each other.
6431719	eng	How much would you be willing to pay for me to do that?
6431720	eng	How long did it take you to finish writing this report?
6431721	eng	All the boys in Mary's class wanted to go out with her.
6431722	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him that you miss him?
6431723	eng	Why are you always so interested in what Tom is doing?
6431724	eng	While Tom was having a good time, Mary stayed at home.
6431725	eng	What Tom really needs now is a little time by himself.
6431726	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that today if he didn't have to.
6431727	eng	Tom works for a company that sells building materials.
6431728	eng	Tom won't be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431729	eng	Tom went to Mary's house to play video games with her.
6431730	eng	Tom wasn't able to help us today, because he was busy.
6431731	eng	Tom was looking forward to spending the day with Mary.
6431732	eng	Tom told me that he wanted to buy a necklace for Mary.
6431733	eng	Tom told me that Mary said she was sick of doing that.
6431734	eng	Tom told me he wanted to buy a couple of loaves bread.
6431735	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd eat anything she made for him.
6431736	eng	Tom told Mary that he had to eat dinner with his boss.
6431737	eng	Tom suggested that I read the contract very carefully.
6431738	eng	Tom spent the money Mary gave him on something to eat.
6431739	eng	Tom says that Mary will eat lunch with John and Alice.
6431740	eng	Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431741	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't eat all the potato chips.
6431742	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very sorry for what he'd done.
6431743	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very interested in doing that.
6431744	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that we could be there.
6431745	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that he didn't do that.
6431746	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary had to do that.

6431748	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't likely do that by herself.
6431749	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be willing to help us.
6431750	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't likely ready to do that yet.
6431751	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't at this afternoon's meeting.
6431752	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still studying French.
6431753	eng	Tom said that Mary was pretty good at speaking French.
6431754	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to go see John in Boston.
6431755	eng	Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
6431756	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be doing that today.
6431757	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6431758	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
6431759	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in doing that.
6431760	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
6431761	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was in her office on Mondays.
6431762	eng	Tom said he thought I might want to do that by myself.
6431763	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that today.
6431764	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that today.
6431765	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be allowed to do that.
6431766	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that this week.
6431767	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that by myself.
6431768	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that this week.
6431769	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that by myself.
6431770	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to help us today.
6431771	eng	Tom knew that Mary was going to be at today's meeting.
6431772	eng	Tom knew that I'd be able to do that faster than Mary.
6431773	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6431774	eng	Tom is the only one who thinks that's going to happen.
6431775	eng	Tom is probably only going to sleep about three hours.
6431776	eng	Tom is probably going to get punished if he does that.
6431777	eng	Tom is probably going to get arrested if he does that.
6431778	eng	Tom is probably going to be starved when he gets home.
6431779	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without help.
6431780	eng	Tom is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.
6431781	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6431782	eng	Tom is going to want to know more about what happened.
6431783	eng	Tom is going to graduate from high school this spring.
6431784	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for you when you get there.
6431785	eng	Tom is going to be staying at least until next Monday.
6431786	eng	Tom is going to be in prison for the rest of his life.
6431787	eng	Tom is going to be here for at least three more years.
6431788	eng	Tom is going to be heading back to Boston after lunch.
6431789	eng	Tom is going to be arriving by train tomorrow evening.
6431790	eng	Tom is going to be able to solve the problem, I think.
6431791	eng	Tom hasn't even read the first page of the report yet.
6431792	eng	Tom has been talking to Mary for the past three hours.
6431793	eng	Tom gave me his notebook full of his favorite recipes.
6431794	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be coming in this morning.
6431795	eng	Tom didn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431796	eng	Tom bought an old bus and is using it as storage shed.
6431797	eng	Tom and Mary ended up falling in love with each other.
6431798	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never to see each other again.
6431799	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John when he was three years old.
6431800	eng	This is a picture of the guitar I bought last weekend.
6431801	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary wants to eat Thai food for lunch.
6431802	eng	Mary ran into one of her ex-boyfriends at Tom's party.
6431803	eng	Mary must've been very beautiful when she was younger.
6431804	eng	It's probably going to be possible for you to do that.
6431805	eng	It's probably going to be possible for Tom to do that.
6431806	eng	It's not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431807	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to do that.
6431808	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to do that.
6431809	eng	It's going to take me at least three hours to do that.
6431810	eng	It's going to take a lot of time to finish doing that.
6431811	eng	If the weather is good, let's walk to school tomorrow.
6431812	eng	I've been waiting for you to tell me what I should do.
6431813	eng	I'm farily certain that Tom wouldn't help you do that.
6431814	eng	I wouldn't have lied if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431815	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that when he was in Boston.
6431816	eng	I wonder if Tom knows Mary ate both of his sandwiches.
6431817	eng	I think you need to tell Tom that you're in love Mary.
6431818	eng	I heard that both Tom and Mary don't know how to swim.
6431819	eng	I don't think we should ask Tom to pay for everything.
6431820	eng	I don't think Tom loves Mary as much as she loves him.
6431821	eng	I don't know what I can do to convince Tom to help us.
6431822	eng	How often do you give advice to people you don't know?
6431823	eng	How much time will it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431824	eng	How much time will it take Tom to hang up the laundry?

6431834	eng	Have you shown Tom the pictures you took last weekend?
6431835	eng	Has anything out of the ordinary happened here lately?
6431836	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you do that.
6431837	eng	All Tom wanted was to spend some time with his family.
6431838	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom that you didn't like him.
6431839	eng	You should've thought about that before you did that.
6431840	eng	Would you be able to come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
6431841	eng	Worrying about that's been keeping me awake at night.
6431842	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's happening?
6431843	eng	Tom would do practically anything to make Mary happy.
6431844	eng	Tom would do practically anything to keep Mary happy.
6431845	eng	Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431846	eng	Tom won't be able to buy what he needs at this store.
6431847	eng	Tom will be really tired when he gets home, won't he?
6431848	eng	Tom wasn't the only boy I kissed. I also kissed John.
6431849	eng	Tom used to make fun of Mary, but he doesn't anymore.
6431850	eng	Tom took care of Mary's cats while she was in Boston.
6431851	eng	Tom told Mary she should eat everything on her plate.
6431852	eng	Tom told Mary she had to eat everything on her plate.
6431853	eng	Tom told Mary he'd lied to her and that he was sorry.

6431867	eng	Tom said that Mary was happy she was able to do that.
6431868	eng	Tom said that Mary has been to Australia three times.
6431869	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be having much fun.
6431870	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't eat both of her sandwiches.

6431886	eng	Tom refused to tell me who gave him those binoculars.
6431887	eng	Tom ran to the bus stop, so he wouldn't miss the bus.
6431888	eng	Tom ran to the bus stop, but he still missed the bus.
6431889	eng	Tom knows Mary will probably be too busy to help him.
6431890	eng	Tom knew that Mary wouldn't eat the fish he'd caught.
6431891	eng	Tom knew that I was glad that that's going to happen.
6431892	eng	Tom is probably going to stay in Boston until Monday.
6431893	eng	Tom is probably going to have a good time doing that.
6431894	eng	Tom is probably going to get injured if he does that.

6431908	eng	Tom is going to learn how to do that sooner or later.
6431909	eng	Tom is going to have plenty of time to do that later.
6431910	eng	Tom is going to go swimming with us tomorrow morning.
6431911	eng	Tom is going to get in trouble if he doesn't do that.
6431912	eng	Tom is going to figure out how to do that eventually.

6431918	eng	Tom is going to be mad at you if you keep doing that.
6431919	eng	Tom is going to be doing that early tomorrow morning.
6431920	eng	Tom is going to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?
6431921	eng	Tom is definitely not going to allow Mary to do that.
6431922	eng	Tom is aware that Mary was in prison for three years.

6431924	eng	Tom has been a teacher's assistant for several years.

6431928	eng	Tom called Mary and asked her to come over his house.
6431929	eng	Tom and Mary still live with their parents in Boston.
6431930	eng	Tom and Mary spent all morning talking to each other.
6431931	eng	Please don't say anything to Tom about what happened.
6431932	eng	One of my favorite things about Boston is the people.
6431933	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary will eat lunch with us tomorrow.
6431934	eng	Mary told Tom that John wasn't her boyfriend anymore.
6431935	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't like each other.
6431936	eng	It's going to take too much time for Tom to get here.
6431937	eng	It's going to take a long time for me to finish this.
6431938	eng	It's going to take Tom a couple of hours to get here.
6431939	eng	It's going to cost about thirty dollars to repair it.
6431940	eng	It's been a long time since I've been back to Boston.
6431941	eng	I'm scared to death right now, to be honest with you.
6431942	eng	I'm only telling you this because I'm your my friend.
6431943	eng	I think you should tell Tom that you don't like Mary.
6431944	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom go to Boston by himself.
6431945	eng	I think Tom kissed Mary for the first time yesterday.
6431946	eng	I think Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
6431947	eng	I haven't decided whether to go college or get a job.
6431948	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what happened.
6431949	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up anytime soon.
6431950	eng	I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
6431951	eng	I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
6431952	eng	How much time did it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431953	eng	How much time did it take Tom to hang up the laundry?
6431954	eng	How much should I pay Tom to help me paint my garage?
6431955	eng	How much money do you think Tom will need to do that?

6431957	eng	How much did Tom get paid to babysit Mary's children?
6431958	eng	How long did it take Tom to convince Mary to help us?
6431959	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to be a French teacher?
6431960	eng	Are you sure it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?
6431961	eng	Apparently, Tom and Mary talked about that on Monday.
6431962	eng	"Is Mary your girlfriend?" "No, she's just a friend."
6431963	eng	You could've let me know you were going out tonight.
6431964	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's going on?
6431965	eng	Why don't you call Tom and invite him to your party?
6431966	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't live in Boston anymore?
6431967	eng	Who did Tom say was going to go to Boston with Mary?
6431968	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got jealous.
6431969	eng	When Tom got home, his children were already asleep.
6431970	eng	What do you think Tom will do now that he's retired?
6431971	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't need to.
6431972	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't have to.
6431973	eng	Tom works for a company that makes automobile parts.
6431974	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't eat her whole sandwich.
6431975	eng	Tom won't make you do anything you don't want to do.
6431976	eng	Tom won't be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431977	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to get any money for doing that.
6431978	eng	Tom was walking too fast for Mary catch up with him.
6431979	eng	Tom was supposed to babysit our children last night.
6431980	eng	Tom was afraid that he was about to lose everything.
6431981	eng	Tom wanted to practice French with a native speaker.
6431982	eng	Tom thought the boy he saw talking to Mary was John.
6431983	eng	Tom thought Mary was going to let him go home early.
6431984	eng	Tom thought Mary lied to him about where she'd been.
6431985	eng	Tom thinks that Mary will eat what he makes for her.
6431986	eng	Tom stole something from the store where Mary works.
6431987	eng	Tom says it doesn't matter to him if Mary does that.
6431988	eng	Tom says he needs the rest of the money you owe him.
6431989	eng	Tom says he has to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431990	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let John drive.
6431991	eng	Tom says he and his wife haven't yet discussed that.
6431992	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary was in love with John.
6431993	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she ought to do.
6431994	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still in her office.
6431995	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be hesitant to do that.
6431996	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be having a lot of fun.
6431997	eng	Tom said that Mary said she was hoping we'd do that.
6431998	eng	Tom said that Mary said she didn't care what we did.
6431999	eng	Tom said it was Mary who ate the last piece of cake.
6432000	eng	Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
6432001	eng	Tom said he thought that Mary had already done that.
6432002	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't forget to do that.
6432003	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that.
6432004	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was still living in Boston.
6432005	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was going to do that today.

6432007	eng	Tom said he thought I might be permitted to do that.
6432008	eng	Tom promised Mary that he'd eat whatever she cooked.
6432009	eng	Tom loved living on the ranch with his grandparents.
6432010	eng	Tom lived in Australia when he was younger, I think.
6432011	eng	Tom listened carefully, but he didn't hear anything.
6432012	eng	Tom knew that the package on the desk was from Mary.
6432013	eng	Tom just got a job working for an insurance company.
6432014	eng	Tom isn't as determined to do that as he used to be.
6432015	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that.

6432021	eng	Tom is never going to tell you what really happened.
6432022	eng	Tom is never going to be able to keep this a secret.
6432023	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that by himself.

6432041	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary should eat so much junk food.
6432042	eng	Tom could hear what was being said in the next room.
6432043	eng	Tom can't do that alone. Mary will have to help him.
6432044	eng	Tom called to say wouldn't be back until after 2:30.
6432045	eng	Tom called to say he wouldn't be back till tomorrow.
6432046	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to go to Boston with Mary.

6432048	eng	Tom and Mary spent the evening watching TV together.
6432049	eng	Tom and Mary ended up getting married to each other.
6432050	eng	Tom and Mary are sitting under that tree over there.
6432051	eng	There are lots of people who could help you do that.
6432052	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been accused of doing that.
6432053	eng	My parents wouldn't let me drive until I was twenty.
6432054	eng	Mary's husband was here a while ago looking for her.
6432055	eng	Mary is a nice girl, except that she talks too much.
6432056	eng	It's going to take me a good three hours to do that.
6432057	eng	It seems like I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6432058	eng	It seems like I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6432059	eng	It looks like I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6432060	eng	It looks like I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6432061	eng	I'd be very surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6432062	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what needs to be done.
6432063	eng	I wonder if Tom really wants us to do that for Mary.
6432064	eng	I wish you hadn't lied to me about where you'd been.
6432065	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to drive.
6432066	eng	I understand French, but I can't speak it very well.
6432067	eng	I thought Tom would apologize to Mary, but he didn't
6432068	eng	I thought Tom knew why we couldn't do that for Mary.
6432069	eng	I think you should tell Tom why you don't like Mary.
6432070	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom play with Mary anymore.
6432071	eng	I think that Tom lied to you about when he did that.

6432073	eng	I still drive that old truck my grandfather gave me.
6432074	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure that I love him.

6432085	eng	You could've let me know you were going to be late.
6432086	eng	Who did Tom think would want to go there with Mary?
6432087	eng	We won't be able to do that if Tom doesn't help us.
6432088	eng	We need to find out where Tom wants us to meet him.

6432188	eng	Tom didn't eat the sandwich that Mary made for him.
6432189	eng	Tom and Mary's wedding anniversary is October 20th.
6432190	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other for three years.
6432191	eng	Tom and I haven't kissed each other in a long time.
6432192	eng	The restaurant we went to yesterday was quite good.
6432193	eng	The only thing Tom ever gave me was his old jacket.
6432194	eng	Someone who knows French well must've written this.
6432195	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends in Boston.
6432196	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I need to do that.
6432197	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I have to do that.

6432199	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been able to do that.
6432200	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever attempted to do that.
6432201	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has asked me to do that again.
6432202	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has apologized for doing that.
6432203	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has agreed to help us do that.
6432204	eng	My parents are the ones who taught me how to drive.
6432205	eng	Mary said she wouldn't do that unless you help her.
6432206	eng	Mary said she wouldn't do that unless I helped her.
6432207	eng	Mary said she didn't know who Tom's girlfriend was.
6432208	eng	Mary refused to accept the roses that Tom sent her.
6432209	eng	Mary knew she wasn't the first girl Tom had kissed.
6432210	eng	Mary is depressed because her husband has left her.
6432211	eng	It's probably going to probably be easy to do that.
6432212	eng	It's probably going to be tough for you to do that.
6432213	eng	It's probably going to be tough for Tom to do that.
6432214	eng	It's probably going to be risky for you to do that.
6432215	eng	It's probably going to be risky for Tom to do that.
6432216	eng	It's probably going to be cheap for you to do that.
6432217	eng	It's going to take three hours to make the changes.
6432218	eng	It's going to take me about three hours to do that.
6432219	eng	It's going to be dark by the time we get to Boston.
6432220	eng	It looks like Tom has fallen down and hurt himself.
6432221	eng	It doesn't matter to me whether you do that or not.
6432222	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you've done for Mary.
6432223	eng	I'd grateful to you if you could teach me to drive.
6432224	eng	I would've let Tom drive if I'd known he wanted to.
6432225	eng	I wonder why Tom lied to us about when he did that.
6432226	eng	I wish I could do that with you today, but I can't.
6432227	eng	I thought Tom was going to buy some blankets today.
6432228	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he wants.
6432229	eng	I ran into some of my friends at the train station.
6432230	eng	I hope you haven't forgotten about today's meeting.
6432231	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what we did.
6432232	eng	I don't think these are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6432233	eng	I didn't think it was a good idea to let Tom drive.
6432234	eng	How much money do you think you'll need to do that?
6432235	eng	How many hours do you think it took Tom to do that?
6432236	eng	Even though it was raining, we went out for a walk.
6432237	eng	Almost all of Tom's ex-wives are friends with Mary.
6432238	eng	You said Tom wouldn't kiss me, but you were wrong.
6432239	eng	You haven't forgotten about the meeting, have you?
6432240	eng	Would you like to go and see a movie this evening?
6432241	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got angry.
6432242	eng	Tom would've been here if he knew he needed to be.
6432243	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in the lobby at 2:30.

6432572	eng	You haven't forgotten to pay the rent, have you?

6432772	eng	It's probably going to be impossible to do that.
6432773	eng	It's probably going to be depressing to do that.
6432774	eng	It's not too late to ask Tom to do that for you.
6432775	eng	It's going to take time to get everything ready.
6432776	eng	It's going to take less than an hour to do that.
6432777	eng	It's going to take all afternoon and maybe more.
6432778	eng	It's going to happen, but just not anytime soon.

6432792	eng	I thought Mary would like the gift Tom gave her.
6432793	eng	I thought Mary said she didn't have a boyfriend.
6432794	eng	I think your baby is crying because he's hungry.
6432795	eng	I think you should try to persuade Tom to drive.
6432796	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that by himself.

6432831	eng	Am I the only one worried that Tom will be late?
6432832	eng	About how many pictures does Tom take every day?
6432833	eng	You won't believe what happened this afternoon.
6432834	eng	You should've lied to Tom about where you were.
6432835	eng	You should've let me drive you home last night.

6433054	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6433055	eng	I would strongly advise you to stop doing that.
6433056	eng	I was born in Boston, but I grew up in Chicago.

6433091	eng	Aren't you the one who taught Tom how to drive?
6433092	eng	Are you sure that Tom was the one who did that?
6433093	eng	A girl named Mary said she was looking for you.
6433094	eng	Your French isn't good enough to get that job.
6433095	eng	You'd really better stop doing that right now.
6433096	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about what we did.

6433104	eng	What time do you usually get home from school?
6433105	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to donate money?
6433106	eng	Tom wouldn't let anybody do anything for Mary.
6433107	eng	Tom won't find anyone who'll do that for Mary.

6433220	eng	Tom drove to the hospital as fast as he could.
6433221	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to work.

6433226	eng	Tom carefully planned what he was going to do.
6433227	eng	Tom asked Mary to lie about where they'd been.
6433228	eng	Tom apparently wants to go to Boston with you.
6433229	eng	Tom and Mary were alone together on the porch.
6433230	eng	Tom and Mary don't usually eat out on Mondays.
6433231	eng	There are lots of people who wouldn't do that.
6433232	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends here.
6433233	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is skating.
6433234	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is fishing.
6433235	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is camping.
6433236	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has the right to do that.
6433237	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been told to do that.
6433238	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want to go with us.
6433239	eng	Mary's oldest son looks just like her husband.
6433240	eng	Mary's husband died three hours after she did.
6433241	eng	Mary's boyfriend is a lot younger than she is.
6433242	eng	Mary told Tom not to kiss her in public again.
6433243	eng	Mary told Tom about what John asked her to do.
6433244	eng	Mary thought Tom was going to do that for her.

6433246	eng	Mary dated Tom's brother before she dated him.
6433247	eng	Mary asked Tom to pretend to be her boyfriend.
6433248	eng	It's probably going to be easy for Tom to win.
6433249	eng	It's going to take Tom a long time to do that.
6433250	eng	It's going to be almost impossible to do that.
6433251	eng	It's been three weeks since Tom has been here.
6433252	eng	It's a good thing that you did that yesterday.
6433253	eng	It's a good thing that Tom did that yesterday.
6433254	eng	It'll take us at least three hours to do that.

6433261	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you do for Mary.
6433262	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for him.
6433263	eng	I'm not going to let Tom drive my car anymore.
6433264	eng	I'm glad you're coming to visit us next month.
6433265	eng	I'm fairly certain that's not going to happen.
6433266	eng	I wouldn't have let Tom drive if I'd been you.
6433267	eng	I wouldn't be able to do that even if I tried.
6433268	eng	I wonder what Tom will do with all that money.
6433269	eng	I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
6433270	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to come here tomorrow.
6433271	eng	I thought you said you wouldn't let Tom drive.
6433272	eng	I think you need to stop doing that right now.
6433273	eng	I think Tom knows he needs to help Mary today.
6433274	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to get here earlier.
6433275	eng	I still wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6433276	eng	I often recommend your website to my students.
6433277	eng	I never even got to tell Tom that I loved him.
6433278	eng	I hope Tom doesn't think we've forgotten Mary.
6433279	eng	I don't think Tom would like it if I did that.
6433280	eng	I don't think Tom will study French next year.
6433281	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
6433282	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you do that.
6433283	eng	I don't know where Tom will be this afternoon.
6433284	eng	I didn't know you were going to let Tom drive.
6433285	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to let Mary drive.
6433286	eng	How much of a discount do you think I can get?
6433287	eng	How much fun do you think Tom's party will be?
6433288	eng	How many pictures have you taken so far today?
6433289	eng	How many patients did Dr. Jackson treat today?
6433290	eng	How long does it usually take to rotate tires?
6433291	eng	How did Tom react when he saw Mary doing that?
6433292	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you.
6433293	eng	Don't think that I'm going to let you do that.
6433294	eng	Don't put your books on the dining room table.
6433295	eng	Don't forget that you need to buy some onions.
6433296	eng	Do you think we should take umbrellas with us?
6433297	eng	Do you really think Tom will be here tomorrow?
6433298	eng	All the boys in Mary's class think she's cute.
6433299	eng	You should let Tom know that you can't drive.
6433300	eng	You should let Tom know that Mary will drive.
6433301	eng	You should get Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433302	eng	You should ask Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433303	eng	You don't really need to lose weight, do you?
6433304	eng	You don't know when Tom will do that, do you?
6433305	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't do that anymore?
6433306	eng	Why are you glad that that's going to happen?
6433307	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a student.
6433308	eng	What Tom wanted was to another piece of cake.
6433309	eng	We didn't know whether Tom was dead or alive.
6433310	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wanted to study French.
6433311	eng	Tom will unlikely be able to help Mary today.

6433317	eng	Tom went back to his car to get his umbrella.
6433318	eng	Tom wasn't expecting you to do that for Mary.
6433319	eng	Tom was the one who taught me how to do this.
6433320	eng	Tom was hoping Mary would eat lunch with him.
6433321	eng	Tom was afraid that he might lose everything.
6433322	eng	Tom wanted to know what had happened to Mary.

6433341	eng	Tom said that he was the last one to do that.
6433342	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary would be early.
6433343	eng	Tom said that Mary was very unlikely do that.
6433344	eng	Tom said that Mary was too stupid to do that.
6433345	eng	Tom said that Mary was too sleepy to do that.

6433488	eng	I wouldn't be able to go even if I wanted to.
6433489	eng	I wonder which bicycles are Tom's and Mary's.
6433490	eng	I wasn't the one who taught Tom how to drive.

6433504	eng	I just hope Tom does what we asked him to do.
6433505	eng	I first met Tom at a football game in Boston.
6433506	eng	I don't think that Tom would ever leave Mary.
6433507	eng	I don't think Tom should've let Mary do that.
6433508	eng	I don't know who kissed Tom and I don't care.
6433509	eng	I don't know how Tom did that, but he did it.
6433510	eng	I don't hug my children as often as I should.
6433511	eng	I convinced Tom to lie about where he'd been.
6433512	eng	I can show you around town if you want me to.
6433513	eng	I bought these flowers for Mary, not for you.
6433514	eng	How many times a day do you check your email?
6433515	eng	How many more months will Tom stay in Boston?
6433516	eng	How long will it take you to clean your room?
6433517	eng	How long does Tom expect us to wait for Mary?
6433518	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French before?
6433519	eng	Dr. Jackson doesn't have any female patients.
6433520	eng	Does Tom think really Mary enjoys doing that?
6433521	eng	Do you think you could persuade Tom to drive?
6433522	eng	Do you think Tom would teach me how to drive?

6433524	eng	Did you do anything interesting last weekend?
6433525	eng	Did Tom say anything about who was with Mary?
6433526	eng	Did Tom say anything about who Mary was with?
6433527	eng	Did Tom actually see Mary eating my sandwich?
6433528	eng	Could what happened to Tom also happen to us?
6433529	eng	Ask Tom if Mary will eat lunch with us today.
6433530	eng	Are you sure you don't mind me tagging along?
6433531	eng	Are you going to tell Tom that you love Mary?
6433532	eng	Would you like me to teach you how to drive?
6433533	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom was born?
6433534	eng	Why is Tom glad that that's going to happen?
6433535	eng	What have you accomplished so far this week?
6433536	eng	What I'd really like is a hot cup of coffee.
6433537	eng	We're getting the results that we hoped for.

6433760	eng	Last summer, I moved to Boston from Chicago.
6433761	eng	Last summer, I moved from Boston to Chicago.

6433814	eng	Why don't you go to the zoo with Tom today?
6433815	eng	Why doesn't Tom want Mary to eat with John?
6433816	eng	Why didn't you say that in the first place?
6433817	eng	Where did you stay when you were in Boston?

6434004	eng	Tom didn't turn up at the party last night.

6434022	eng	There's nothing I like more than spaghetti.
6434023	eng	There are several possible ways to do that.
6434024	eng	The doctor says that Tom will be all right.
6434025	eng	The children want you to read them a story.
6434026	eng	Tell Tom that we're not going to help Mary.
6434027	eng	Something really should be done about that.
6434028	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has agreed to do that.
6434029	eng	My favorite kind of ice cream is chocolate.

6434059	eng	It's probably going to be raining tomorrow.
6434060	eng	It's probably going to be cheap to do that.
6434061	eng	It's just going to take a few more minutes.
6434062	eng	It's going to take us hours to finish this.
6434063	eng	It's going to stop snowing sooner or later.
6434064	eng	It's going to cost you more to go by plane.
6434065	eng	It's going to cost at least thirty dollars.
6434066	eng	It's been a while since I've talked to Tom.
6434067	eng	It might be a good idea to stop doing that.
6434068	eng	Is Tom the one who taught you how to drive?
6434069	eng	I've finished reading the book you lent me.
6434070	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434071	eng	I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
6434072	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't be interested.
6434073	eng	I'm going to buy myself a birthday present.
6434074	eng	I'm absolutely positive that I can do that.
6434075	eng	I'd rather not kiss Tom if I don't have to.
6434076	eng	I wonder if that'll happen in our lifetimes
6434077	eng	I wish you'd stop lying to us all the time.
6434078	eng	I wish I could help you today, but I can't.
6434079	eng	I wanted to drive, but Tom wouldn't let me.
6434080	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom works.
6434081	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom lives.
6434082	eng	I want to know if Tom knows how to do that.
6434083	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he wouldn't let me.
6434084	eng	I told Tom he could buy whatever he wanted.
6434085	eng	I told Tom he could buy anything he wanted.
6434086	eng	I thought I saw Tom kissing Mary yesterday.
6434087	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom drive anymore.
6434088	eng	I think we all know that that's a bad idea.
6434089	eng	I think Tom won't stop crying anytime soon.
6434090	eng	I think Tom said that Mary was from Boston.
6434091	eng	I think Tom said he needed to buy a shovel.
6434092	eng	I spend a lot of time doing things for Tom.
6434093	eng	I sang in the church choir for three years.
6434094	eng	I intend to lie to Tom about what happened.
6434095	eng	I don't think you should be doing that now.
6434096	eng	I don't think this is exactly what we need.
6434097	eng	I don't think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6434098	eng	I don't think Tom would ever do that again.
6434099	eng	I don't think Tom would be able to help us.
6434100	eng	I don't think Mary would leave her husband.
6434101	eng	I didn't let Tom talk me into helping Mary.
6434102	eng	I didn't allow Tom do what he wanted to do.
6434103	eng	I did know that Tom used to live in Boston.
6434104	eng	How much sugar should I put in your coffee?
6434105	eng	How much more work do you have to do today?
6434106	eng	How much more weight does Tom want to lose?
6434107	eng	How much do you think I could make busking?
6434108	eng	How much coffee did you drink this morning?
6434109	eng	How many pounds do you think I should lose?
6434110	eng	How long did it take you to read that book?
6434111	eng	How long did it take Tom to get here today?
6434112	eng	How did Tom get Mary to eat her vegetables?
6434113	eng	Eventually Tom purchased a house in Boston.
6434114	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you drive?
6434115	eng	Could you please be quiet? Tom is sleeping.
6434116	eng	Are you still working for the same company?
6434117	eng	Are you going to take an umbrella with you?
6434118	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "In the garden."
6434119	eng	You should've asked me to do that for you.

6434121	eng	Would you happen to know why Tom was late?
6434122	eng	Where do you think Tom will go to college?
6434123	eng	When was the last time Tom came to Boston?
6434124	eng	When and where did you and Tom first kiss?
6434125	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to help you?
6434126	eng	We still don't know what Tom will do next.
6434127	eng	We shouldn't tell Tom about what happened.
6434128	eng	Tom's family lived in Boston at that time.
6434129	eng	Tom wouldn't likely go camping by himself.
6434130	eng	Tom wouldn't let you go there by yourself.

6434247	eng	Tom said he didn't want to let Mary drive.
6434248	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary was late.
6434249	eng	Tom said Mary might not eat lunch with us.
6434250	eng	Tom recommended that I go there by myself.
6434251	eng	Tom noticed that Mary was talking to John.
6434252	eng	Tom needs more than three hundred dollars.

6434255	eng	Tom knew that Mary was likely to be awake.
6434256	eng	Tom knew that I was determined to do that.

6434265	eng	Tom is the person who helped Mary do that.
6434266	eng	Tom is the one who taught me how to drive.
6434267	eng	Tom is the least likely person to do that.
6434268	eng	Tom is swimming with his kids in the pool.
6434269	eng	Tom is staying at the hotel near my house.
6434270	eng	Tom is probably never going to walk again.

6434278	eng	Tom is on his way to Mary's apartment now.
6434279	eng	Tom is never going to find out about this.
6434280	eng	Tom is likely going to follow your advice.
6434281	eng	Tom is likely going to be absent tomorrow.
6434282	eng	Tom is in Boston visiting his grandmother.

6434314	eng	Tom is going to be a good father, I think.
6434315	eng	Tom is expected back in Boston in October.
6434316	eng	Tom is definitely going to try to do that.
6434317	eng	Tom hugged Mary and then got on the train.
6434318	eng	Tom hasn't been married to Mary very long.
6434319	eng	Tom has until Monday to finish the report.

6434324	eng	Tom has been trying to live a normal life.
6434325	eng	Tom has been spending more time with Mary.
6434326	eng	Tom has been ready to do that for a while.
6434327	eng	Tom has asked Mary not to do that anymore.
6434328	eng	Tom has a tattoo of an eagle on his chest.
6434329	eng	Tom found the necklace that Mary had lost.
6434330	eng	Tom fell in love with one of his students.
6434331	eng	Tom fell down the stairs and hurt himself.
6434332	eng	Tom eventually told me what I ought to do.
6434333	eng	Tom doesn't understand why Mary does that.
6434334	eng	Tom doesn't know who's going to help Mary.
6434335	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to eat so much candy.
6434336	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would let him drive.
6434337	eng	Tom didn't say where or when to meet Mary.
6434338	eng	Tom didn't really expect to find anything.
6434339	eng	Tom didn't read the message Mary sent him.
6434340	eng	Tom didn't know what was likely to happen?
6434341	eng	Tom didn't have time to go shopping today.
6434342	eng	Tom didn't get home until late last night.
6434343	eng	Tom didn't expect you to do that for Mary.
6434344	eng	Tom couldn't find his way out of the cave.
6434345	eng	Tom couldn't come today because he's sick.
6434346	eng	Tom could probably teach you how to drive.
6434347	eng	Tom convinced Mary to make him a sandwich.
6434348	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach John how to drive.
6434349	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the park with him.
6434350	eng	Tom and Mary sat side by side on the sofa.
6434351	eng	Tom and Mary hung up the laundry together.
6434352	eng	Tom and Mary don't hug each other anymore.
6434353	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John three years ago.
6434354	eng	Tom and I'll hang up the laundry together.
6434355	eng	Tom agreed to meet with Mary in the lobby.
6434356	eng	They knocked thirty dollars off the price.
6434357	eng	There's nothing I like more than swimming.
6434358	eng	There's not much chance of that happening.
6434359	eng	There's a jewelry store not far from here.
6434360	eng	There was nothing we could do to help Tom.
6434361	eng	The book I bought yesterday was expensive.
6434362	eng	Personally, I think you shouldn't do that.
6434363	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that today.
6434364	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that again.
6434365	eng	Mary's husband told me she wasn't at home.
6434366	eng	Mary will do anything she can to help Tom.
6434367	eng	Mary wasn't a popular girl in high school.
6434368	eng	Mary told Tom she wanted something to eat.
6434369	eng	Mary talked to Tom about that, didn't she?
6434370	eng	Mary showed us a picture of her boyfriend.
6434371	eng	Mary showed me a picture of her boyfriend.
6434372	eng	Mary says she wants to show Tom something.
6434373	eng	Mary plans to break up with her boyfriend.
6434374	eng	Mary looks almost identical to her sister.
6434375	eng	Mary didn't tell me Tom was her boyfriend.
6434376	eng	Mary bought herself a dress for the party.
6434377	eng	Many of Tom's friends think he's a genius.
6434378	eng	It's unlikely that Tom will be here today.
6434379	eng	It's time for the kids to go to bed.
6434380	eng	It's probably going to be safe to do that.
6434381	eng	It's going to take longer than you expect.
6434382	eng	It's going to take a long time to do that.
6434383	eng	It's going to be sunny tomorrow afternoon.
6434384	eng	It's going to be crowded everywhere today.
6434385	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't do that.
6434386	eng	It seems Tom is having trouble doing that.
6434387	eng	It looks like Tom hasn't shaved in a week.
6434388	eng	I've been studying French for three hours.
6434389	eng	I'm sure that Tom won't help Mary do that.
6434390	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if we did that.
6434391	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach you how to drive.
6434392	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will be there tonight.
6434393	eng	I'm going to give all my possessions away.
6434394	eng	I'll tell Tom you're not going to do that.
6434395	eng	I'd rather not do that if I don't have to.
6434396	eng	I'd like to stay here for three more days.
6434397	eng	I wonder if Tom's friends would help Mary.
6434398	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that on Monday.
6434399	eng	I wonder how much Tom got paid to do that.
6434400	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to Mary about that.
6434401	eng	I wish I could do that today, but I can't.
6434402	eng	I was the one who taught Tom how to drive.
6434403	eng	I want to know if you know how to do that.
6434404	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he pushed me away.
6434405	eng	I think that's going to happen quite soon.
6434406	eng	I think Tom should do that somewhere else.
6434407	eng	I think Tom didn't do what he said he did.
6434408	eng	I think Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434409	eng	I think I'll never get used to doing this.
6434410	eng	I suppose I really ought to do that today.
6434411	eng	I really don't like the way Tom does that.
6434412	eng	I never listen to classical music anymore.
6434413	eng	I have a few friends who can speak French.
6434414	eng	I had to drive home because Tom was drunk.
6434415	eng	I find it hard to understand Tom's French.
6434416	eng	I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
6434417	eng	I don't think you should do that with Tom.
6434418	eng	I don't think Tom will be here until 2:30.
6434419	eng	I don't think Tom is obligated to do that.
6434420	eng	I don't really like the way Tom does that.
6434421	eng	I don't always kiss my children goodnight.
6434422	eng	I can't remember what happened after that.
6434423	eng	How much time will it take you to do that?
6434424	eng	How much time will it take Tom to do that?
6434425	eng	How much money do you usually have on you?
6434426	eng	How many times a month does Tom come here?
6434427	eng	How many sandwiches did Tom make for Mary?
6434428	eng	How long have you spent doing that so far?
6434429	eng	How long do you intend to keep doing that?
6434430	eng	How do you think Tom will propose to Mary?
6434431	eng	How did you find out that Tom kissed Mary?
6434432	eng	How did Tom know we were looking for Mary?
6434433	eng	Have you told Tom why you don't like Mary?
6434434	eng	Don't mothers kiss their children anymore?
6434435	eng	Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
6434436	eng	Do you think Tom will come to pick you up?
6434437	eng	Do you think Tom is ever going to do that?
6434438	eng	Do you still feel like eating out tonight?
6434439	eng	Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
6434440	eng	Did Tom tell Mary why he ate her sandwich?
6434441	eng	Did Tom ask you to go to Boston with Mary?
6434442	eng	Did Tom ask Mary why she ate his sandwich?
6434443	eng	Could you tell me where I can park my car?
6434444	eng	Can you help me clean up before you leave?
6434445	eng	Are you sure that Tom is Mary's boyfriend?
6434446	eng	About thirty people were severely injured.
6434447	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "On the cheek."
6434448	eng	You're just the person I was looking for.
6434449	eng	You don't speak French very well, do you?
6434450	eng	Would you like me to unwrap that for you?
6434451	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom lives?
6434452	eng	Would it be all right if I let Tom drive?
6434453	eng	Would Tom care if Mary ate lunch with me?
6434454	eng	With friends like Tom, who needs enemies?
6434455	eng	Why isn't Tom hanging up the laundry now?
6434456	eng	Why don't you want to go to school today?
6434457	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't like Boston?
6434458	eng	Why do you let Tom to treat you that way?
6434459	eng	Why didn't you do what I asked you to do?
6434460	eng	Who does Tom think is going to help Mary?
6434461	eng	Who did Tom think would do that for Mary?
6434462	eng	Who did Tom think was going to meet Mary?
6434463	eng	Who did Tom say went to Boston with Mary?

6434468	eng	When was the last time Tom drove a truck?
6434469	eng	When do you think Tom will want to leave?
6434470	eng	When I first met Tom, he was a bartender.
6434471	eng	What do you think Tom's favorite food is?
6434472	eng	What Tom wanted was some peace and quiet.
6434473	eng	We don't know what caused that to happen.
6434474	eng	Tom's wife died three hours after he did.
6434475	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary sing with his band.
6434476	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that now, would he?
6434477	eng	Tom would do anything to make keep happy.
6434478	eng	Tom would do anything to make Mary happy.
6434479	eng	Tom won't be very comfortable doing that.

6434481	eng	Tom will do anything he can to help Mary.

6434511	eng	Tom stayed with us in Boston last spring.
6434512	eng	Tom spent the rest of his life in Boston.
6434513	eng	Tom spent the next three years in Boston.
6434514	eng	Tom spent most of his time reading books.

6435091	eng	I wouldn't want to do that for a living.
6435092	eng	I wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6435093	eng	I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
6435094	eng	I wonder if you could help me with this.

6435113	eng	I don't think Tom would ever forget you.
6435114	eng	I don't think Tom will be too much help.
6435115	eng	I don't think Tom was telling the truth.
6435116	eng	I don't really like punk rock very much.

6435146	eng	Are you sure that Tom doesn't like Mary?
6435147	eng	Are you still working at the same place?
6435148	eng	You'd better stop doing that right now.
6435149	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about that.
6435150	eng	You shouldn't have been so mean to Tom.
6435151	eng	You should tell Tom that you love Mary.
6435152	eng	Would you like me to unwrap it for you?
6435153	eng	Why don't you help Tom paint the fence?
6435154	eng	Why do you think Tom shouldn't do that?
6435155	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't trust you?

6435799	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French?

6436014	eng	Tom didn't come in to work yesterday.
6436015	eng	Tom convinced Mary to tell the truth.
6436016	eng	Tom came here to ask us to help Mary.
6436017	eng	Tom called me at 2:30 in the morning.

6436025	eng	Tom and Mary have both eaten already.
6436026	eng	Tom and Mary aren't on the same team.
6436027	eng	Tom and Mary are high school seniors.
6436028	eng	Tom and I haven't discussed that yet.
6436029	eng	Tom almost never kisses his children.
6436030	eng	These suitcases are Tom's and Mary's.
6436031	eng	These are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6436032	eng	These are Tom's and Mary's suitcases.
6436033	eng	There's a perfectly good explanation.
6436034	eng	There's a barbershop across the road.
6436035	eng	There are lots of people who do that.
6436036	eng	The only thing Tom could do was wait.
6436037	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has gone abroad.
6436038	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has found a job.
6436039	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want that.
6436040	eng	Mary thought the man she saw was Tom.
6436041	eng	Mary thought the boy she saw was Tom.
6436042	eng	Mary is kind of beautiful, isn't she?
6436043	eng	Make sure Tom doesn't leave his room.
6436044	eng	Let's keep this up as long as we can.
6436045	eng	It's quite unlikely Tom will do that.
6436046	eng	It's probably going to snow tomorrow.
6436047	eng	It's going to be dark in a few hours.
6436048	eng	It's going to be an interesting game.
6436049	eng	It's fine by me if you don't do that.
6436050	eng	It'll be difficult to find a job now.
6436051	eng	It won't be all that easy to do that.
6436052	eng	It was Tom who kissed Mary yesterday.
6436053	eng	It should be easy for Tom to do that.
6436054	eng	It is inevitable that that'll happen.
6436055	eng	It doesn't make any difference to me.
6436056	eng	I've quit drinking carbonated drinks.
6436057	eng	I've been waiting for you since 2:30.
6436058	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't need to do that.
6436059	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't have to do that.
6436060	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't do that.
6436061	eng	I'm fairly certain that won't happen.
6436062	eng	I'd rather stay home and read a book.
6436063	eng	I'd rather not to lie to Tom anymore.
6436064	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed.
6436065	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.
6436066	eng	I wonder whether Tom would help Mary.

6436069	eng	I wish Tom had asked us to help Mary.
6436070	eng	I wish Tom had asked Mary to help us.
6436071	eng	I told Tom that I'd help him do that.
6436072	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that.
6436073	eng	I think this is exactly what we need.
6436074	eng	I think that it was Tom who did that.
6436075	eng	I think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6436076	eng	I think Tom's leg is much better now.
6436077	eng	I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
6436078	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to hug him.
6436079	eng	I think Tom doesn't enjoy doing that.
6436080	eng	I talked to my attorney this morning.
6436081	eng	I know the girl who's talking to Tom.
6436082	eng	I hope you didn't give Tom any money.
6436083	eng	I hope Tom and Mary do that together.
6436084	eng	I hear that you kissed Tom yesterday.
6436085	eng	I haven't seen a good movie recently.
6436086	eng	I don't want to think about that now.
6436087	eng	I don't want to go home empty-handed.
6436088	eng	I don't think you should do that now.
6436089	eng	I don't think Tom would let me drive.
6436090	eng	I don't think Tom will need our help.
6436091	eng	I don't think I should let you drive.
6436092	eng	I don't know where I left sunglasses.
6436093	eng	I don't know what I was so afraid of.
6436094	eng	I don't have a place to stay tonight.
6436095	eng	I don't feel like doing that anymore.
6436096	eng	I could've lied to you, but I didn't.
6436097	eng	I can't imagine that happening to me.
6436098	eng	I asked Tom to teach me how to drive.
6436099	eng	How much would you pay us to do that?
6436100	eng	How much water does this bucket hold?
6436101	eng	How much time did it take to do that?
6436102	eng	How much snow do you think we'll get?

6436110	eng	How much candy did Tom eat yesterday?
6436111	eng	How much can we really depend on Tom?
6436112	eng	How many times a day do you kiss Tom?
6436113	eng	How many pounds have you lost so far?
6436114	eng	How long would it take us to do that?
6436115	eng	How do you know Tom didn't kiss Mary?

6436117	eng	How did you get Tom to let you drive?
6436118	eng	Have you told Tom that you love Mary?
6436119	eng	Do you think Tom will let Mary drive?
6436120	eng	Do you think I need to pay this bill?
6436121	eng	Do you really think Tom will help us.
6436122	eng	Do you really think Tom will do that?
6436123	eng	Do you and Tom ever discuss politics?
6436124	eng	Do Tom and Mary still live in Boston?
6436125	eng	Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
6436126	eng	Are you still working as a bartender?
6436127	eng	You shouldn't have brought Tom here.
6436128	eng	You should never have let Tom drive.
6436129	eng	You don't have to be so mean to Tom.
6436130	eng	Will Tom drive to Boston by himself?
