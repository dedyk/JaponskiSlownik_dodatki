6431241	eng	Tom knows that he should do something, but he's not sure what.
6431242	eng	Tom knows that he has to do something, but he's not sure what.
6431243	eng	Tom is probably going to get injured if he does that that way.
6431244	eng	Tom is probably going to be doing that early tomorrow morning.
6431245	eng	Tom is likely to lie to Mary about where he spent the weekend.
6431246	eng	Tom is likely going to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
6431247	eng	Tom is likely going to be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6431248	eng	Tom is going to provide you with all the information you need.
6431249	eng	Tom is going to need at least $300 to buy everything he needs.
6431250	eng	Tom is going to leave for Boston first thing tomorrow morning.
6431251	eng	Tom is going to be finished doing that by the end of the week.
6431252	eng	Tom is going to be arriving tomorrow at 2:30 in the afternoon.
6431253	eng	Tom finished reading the letter and put it in his desk drawer.
6431254	eng	Tom and Mary have parties at their home several times a month.
6431255	eng	Tom and Mary are probably never going to see each other again.
6431256	eng	My parents died in an automobile accident when I was thirteen.
6431257	eng	Mary isn't the sort of girl who would do what you say she did.
6431258	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't want to do that together.
6431259	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to finish this job.
6431260	eng	I'm sure I'll eventually go to Boston. I just don't know when.
6431261	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is aware that Mary has been arrested.
6431262	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive your car again.
6431263	eng	How many women have you talked to since you got out of prison?
6431264	eng	How many hours a week do you help out at the homeless shelter?
6431265	eng	You really should lie to Tom about where you were last night.
6431266	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in front of the library at 2:30.
6431267	eng	Tom was walking so fast that Mary couldn't catch up with him.
6431268	eng	Tom texted Mary to let her know that he'd be late for dinner.
6431269	eng	Tom said something to Mary, but I couldn't hear what he said.
6431270	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
6431271	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was always in her office on Mondays.
6431272	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who wanted to do that.
6431273	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who needed to do that.
6431274	eng	Tom said he thought I might be required to do that by myself.
6431275	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to eat anything she didn't want to.
6431276	eng	Tom promised me he'd buy me something to eat on the way home.
6431277	eng	Tom noticed Mary's new hairstyle, but he didn't say anything.
6431278	eng	Tom knows you didn't eat any of the cookies he baked for you.
6431279	eng	Tom knew Mary was looking for him, so he hid in the basement.
6431280	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431281	eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to drive.
6431282	eng	Tom is probably going to figure out it was Mary who did that.
6431283	eng	Tom is going to have to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?
6431284	eng	Tom is going to buy his mother some flowers for Mother's Day.
6431285	eng	Tom is going to be the first one in our class to get married.
6431286	eng	Tom is going to be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
6431287	eng	Tom has been looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431288	eng	Tom couldn't help us today, because he was busy helping Mary.
6431289	eng	Tom and Mary talked on the phone with each other all evening.
6431290	eng	Tom and Mary take a walk together after dinner every evening.
6431291	eng	Tom and Mary started doing that when they were both thirteen.
6431292	eng	Tom and Mary helped their mother decorate the Christmas tree.
6431293	eng	That's an interesting idea, but I don't think we can do that.
6431294	eng	Mary doesn't like it when her boyfriend kisses her in public.
6431295	eng	Mary called her mother and told her she'd be late for dinner.
6431296	eng	It's going to take Tom three hours to finish what he's doing.
6431297	eng	It's going to be difficult to complete this report by Monday.
6431298	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, please wait on the porch.
6431299	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't want to drive.
6431300	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431301	eng	I don't think Tom has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
6431302	eng	I don't have to go into the office until 2:30 this afternoon.
6431303	eng	Apparently, that's the only way we can get that done in time.
6431304	eng	Tom will probably feel better once he gets something to eat.
6431305	eng	Tom was supposed to meet me in the lobby, but he never came.
6431306	eng	Tom was shocked when he learned that Mary had been arrested.
6431307	eng	Tom wanted to do that this afternoon, but I told him not to.
6431308	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't eat the stew if it had pork in it.
6431309	eng	Tom thought that the best solution was to ask Mary to leave.
6431310	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wanted to do that.
6431311	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary needed to do that.
6431312	eng	Tom said he wanted me to help him paint his garage tomorrow.
6431313	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that this afternoon.

6431315	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might want to walk home by herself.
6431316	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to walk home by herself.
6431317	eng	Tom said he thought I might be allowed to do that by myself.
6431318	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to eat anything she doesn't like.
6431319	eng	Tom refused to tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431320	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6431321	eng	Tom is probably going to ask Mary for permission to do that.
6431322	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do this.
6431323	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do that.
6431324	eng	Tom is likely going to be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6431325	eng	Tom is going to keep doing that if someone doesn't stop him.
6431326	eng	Tom is going to get into trouble if he eats all the cookies.
6431327	eng	Tom is going to get in trouble if he eats all the ice cream.
6431328	eng	Tom is going to get himself killed if he's not more careful.
6431329	eng	Tom is going to be staying with us for the next three weeks.
6431330	eng	Tom decided not to tell his parents about what had happened.
6431331	eng	Tom called to let me know he wouldn't be coming to my party.
6431332	eng	Tom and Mary will be leaving for Australia tomorrow morning.
6431333	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never going to see each other again.
6431334	eng	There's something on that shelf that both Tom and Mary want.
6431335	eng	The weather's nice and it's my day off, so I'm going hiking.
6431336	eng	The picnic was held in the gymnasium because it was raining.
6431337	eng	Ninety percent of the time Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
6431338	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom was ready to become a father.
6431339	eng	If Tom doesn't get an A on the test, his mother will be mad.
6431340	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you've never done that.
6431341	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't speak French.
6431342	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you eat his piece of cake.
6431343	eng	How many times a week does Tom help at the homeless shelter?
6431344	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431345	eng	Tom would've let you drive if you'd told him you wanted to.
6431346	eng	Tom will tell Mary everything he knows about the situation.
6431347	eng	Tom will lose his job if he keeps showing up late for work.
6431348	eng	Tom was playing basketball this afternoon with his friends.
6431349	eng	Tom was hoping Mary wouldn't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431350	eng	Tom tried to pick up Mary's suitcase, but it was too heavy.
6431351	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably in the cafeteria, eating lunch.
6431352	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wouldn't do that.
6431353	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary had been told not to do that.

6431362	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that anymore.
6431363	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that anymore.
6431364	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to eat Chinese food this evening.
6431365	eng	Tom recognized Mary as soon as she walked through the door.
6431366	eng	Tom is probably going to get hurt if he does that that way.
6431367	eng	Tom is probably going to be ready by the time we get there.
6431368	eng	Tom is probably going to be drunk by the time we get there.
6431369	eng	Tom is never going to understand why people don't like him.

6431371	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without your help.
6431372	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without some help.
6431373	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that before lunch.
6431374	eng	Tom is going to help you as soon as he finishes doing that.
6431375	eng	Tom is going to have to do that even if he doesn't want to.

6431386	eng	Tom and Mary have three children under the age of thirteen.
6431387	eng	The only language I can speak other than French is English.
6431388	eng	It's just not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431389	eng	It's hard to believe that Tom would do something like that.
6431390	eng	It's going to take some time to finish unloading the truck.
6431391	eng	It's going to take a little time to get used to doing this.
6431392	eng	It's going to be a long time before I try doing that again.
6431393	eng	It wasn't clear on Monday whether Tom would do that or not.
6431394	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, just wait on the porch.
6431395	eng	I wouldn't have done that if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431396	eng	I was the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431397	eng	I have a sore throat, so I don't know if I can sing or not.

6431404	eng	Do you really have enough money to buy everything you need?
6431405	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary were going to be there?
6431406	eng	Tom wouldn't be helping us today if Mary hadn't asked him.
6431407	eng	Tom wished he hadn't asked Mary to teach him how to drive.
6431408	eng	Tom wasn't waiting for Mary where he said he'd be waiting.

6431412	eng	Tom wanted to explain everything to Mary, but he couldn't.

6431421	eng	Tom shouted as loud as he could, but Mary didn't hear him.
6431422	eng	Tom saw Mary eating by herself at a table near the window.

6431425	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be concerned about that.
6431426	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't attend this afternoon's meeting.

6431464	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to finish this.
6431465	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
6431466	eng	In case of rain, the picnic will be held in the gymnasium.
6431467	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from boxing and returned to teaching.
6431468	eng	If you do that this way, you'll be able to save some time.
6431469	eng	I can't force you to do that, but you really should do it.

6431539	eng	I'm the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431540	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what Tom's phone number is.
6431541	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't like Mary.
6431542	eng	I heard that Tom will play tennis with us this afternoon.
6431543	eng	I haven't seen Tom since we were in high school together.
6431544	eng	I ended up telling Tom what Mary told me not to tell him.
6431545	eng	I don't like lying, but sometimes I think it's necessary.
6431546	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that with Mary.
6431547	eng	How much money do you estimate will be needed to do that?
6431548	eng	How much money do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6431549	eng	How long do you think it would take me to read this book?
6431550	eng	Do you think Tom will be able to teach Mary how to drive?
6431551	eng	Do you really think Tom would forget something like that?
6431552	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary don't like chocolate?
6431553	eng	At the end of the 2013 season, Tom retired from football.
6431554	eng	Apparently, that's the only way Tom knows how to do that.
6431555	eng	You don't need to buy any sugar. We already have plenty.
6431556	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what the problem is?
6431557	eng	Where were you on October 20th at 2:30 in the afternoon?
6431558	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he started laughing.
6431559	eng	We've been waiting for you to tell us what we should do.
6431560	eng	Tom, Mary and John all live with their father in Boston.
6431561	eng	Tom works from early in the morning until late at night.
6431562	eng	Tom will hurt himself if he's not a little more careful.
6431564	eng	Tom used to hang up the laundry, but he doesn't anymore.
6431565	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't know how to eat with chopsticks.
6431566	eng	Tom thought Mary had lied to him about where she'd been.
6431567	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary ate dinner with John last night.
6431568	eng	Tom said that he wasn't the last one to leave the party.
6431569	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary would do that.
6431570	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary could do that.
6431571	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that Mary didn't do that.
6431572	eng	Tom said that he was glad that that was going to happen.
6431573	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary wouldn't do that.
6431574	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary couldn't do that.
6431575	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary was just about to do that.
6431576	eng	Tom said that Mary would probably be willing to do that.
6431577	eng	Tom said that Mary would probably be too shy to do that.
6431578	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be unwilling to do that.
6431579	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be motivated to do that.
6431580	eng	Tom said that Mary was pretty good at playing the piano.
6431581	eng	Tom said that Mary was pretty good at playing the flute.
6431582	eng	Tom said that Mary looked like she was enjoying himself.
6431583	eng	Tom said he'd rather study French with a native speaker.
6431584	eng	Tom said he'd likely buy some things at the flea market.
6431585	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would unlikely want to do that.
6431586	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
6431587	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be permitted to do that.
6431588	eng	Tom often sleeps on the train on his way home from work.
6431589	eng	Tom knew that Mary would be difficult to get along with.
6431590	eng	Tom is probably going to still be in Boston next Monday.
6431591	eng	Tom is probably going to get back from Boston on Monday.
6431592	eng	Tom is probably going to finish what he's doing by 2:30.
6431593	eng	Tom is most likely going to be the first one to show up.
6431594	eng	Tom is likely going to only sleep for about three hours.
6431595	eng	Tom is likely going to be very hungry when he gets home.
6431596	eng	Tom is likely going to be gone by the time we get there.
6431597	eng	Tom is going to need at least $300 to buy what he needs.
6431598	eng	Tom is going to live in Boston for at least three years.
6431599	eng	Tom is going to have to work late every night this week.
6431600	eng	Tom is going to be ready to go by the time you get here.
6431601	eng	Tom heard a couple of students talking in the classroom.
6431602	eng	Tom has until October 20th to finish writing the report.
6431603	eng	Tom has been waiting all afternoon for Mary to get home.
6431604	eng	Tom has been trying to get a hold of Mary all afternoon.
6431605	eng	Tom has a French test tomorrow that he has to study for.
6431606	eng	Tom didn't know Mary would eat the whole pie by herself.
6431607	eng	Tom came to Boston for the first time when he was three.
6431608	eng	Tom and Mary were playing tennis together earlier today.
6431609	eng	Tom and Mary send each other Christmas cards every year.
6431610	eng	Tom and Mary moved to Boston and opened an antique shop.
6431611	eng	Tom and Mary had lunch together in the school cafeteria.
6431612	eng	Tom and Mary are leaving for Australia tomorrow morning.
6431613	eng	On my days off, I often sit in the park and read a book.
6431614	eng	Mary is one of the most beautiful girls I've ever met.
6431615	eng	Mary is a good-looking girl, but she's not too friendly.
6431616	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for you to do that.
6431617	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for Tom to do that.
6431618	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to living here.
6431619	eng	It's going to take me a long time to get over this cold.
6431620	eng	It's going to be impossible to do that, don't you think?
6431621	eng	It's going to be impossible for Tom to do that tomorrow.
6431622	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't see Mary kissing John.
6431623	eng	If you ask Tom to lend you some money, he probably will.
6431624	eng	I'd rather not lie to my parents about where we've been.
6431625	eng	I was waiting for you to tell me what needed to be done.
6431626	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom hang out with Mary anymore.
6431627	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure I want to marry him.
6431628	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that for Mary.
6431629	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to go to Boston with Mary.
6431630	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that for Mary.
6431631	eng	How much money will it cost to get that book translated?
6431632	eng	How much money do you estimate Tom will need to do that?
6431633	eng	How long do you think it would take you to mow our lawn?
6431634	eng	Do you think Tom would've wanted us to do that for Mary?
6431635	eng	Do you know why Tom doesn't want me to sit next to Mary?
6431636	eng	Do you know whether or not Tom will sing for us tonight?
6431637	eng	Are you certain it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?
6431638	eng	Apparently, Tom will be going to a university in Boston.
6431639	eng	Tom's house is only about a five-minute walk from here.
6431640	eng	Tom would prefer to study French with a native speaker.
6431641	eng	Tom will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.
6431642	eng	Tom will be mad at Mary when he finds out what she did.
6431643	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6431644	eng	Tom walks his dog every morning before he goes to work.
6431645	eng	Tom told the police that he'd been mugged by three men.
6431646	eng	Tom told me that he and Mary were going to get married.
6431647	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted John to teach him how to drive.
6431648	eng	Tom told Mary he thought they should get back together.
6431649	eng	Tom says he needs to find somebody to do that for Mary.
6431650	eng	Tom said that he was very sure that Mary would do that.
6431651	eng	Tom said that he was responsible for what had happened.
6431652	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary liked him very much.
6431653	eng	Tom said that Mary has been told to do that many times.
6431654	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't eat either of her sandwiches.
6431655	eng	Tom said he'll be ready to go by the time you get here.
6431656	eng	Tom said he'd likely buy some stuff at the flea market.
6431657	eng	Tom said he was going to be in Boston for another week.
6431658	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be upset if he did that.
6431659	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6431660	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be motivated to do that.
6431661	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be desperate to do that.
6431662	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be bored if we did that.
6431663	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't through doing that yet.
6431664	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to be doing that.
6431665	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be required to do that.
6431666	eng	Tom said he thought I might be allowed to do that soon.
6431667	eng	Tom noticed Mary's car parked in front of John's house.
6431668	eng	Tom needed to go back to his house to get his passport.
6431669	eng	Tom left his apartment earlier this morning than usual.
6431670	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knows what happened to Mary.
6431671	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
6431672	eng	Tom isn't as interested in doing that as he used to be.
6431673	eng	Tom is trying to figure out how he can make Mary happy.
6431674	eng	Tom is probably going to walk to work tomorrow morning.
6431675	eng	Tom is probably going to be excused from doing that.
6431676	eng	Tom is probably going to tell you the same thing I did.
6431677	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he'll never do that.
6431678	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he wants to do that.
6431679	eng	Tom is probably going to be present at today's meeting.
6431680	eng	Tom is probably going to be late for work this morning.
6431681	eng	Tom is probably going to be exhausted after doing that.
6431682	eng	Tom is never going to have to worry about going hungry.
6431683	eng	Tom is looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431684	eng	Tom is hoping Mary won't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431685	eng	Tom is going to try to finish writing the report today.
6431686	eng	Tom is going to take a walk in the park this afternoon.
6431687	eng	Tom is going to be out of the office until next Monday.
6431688	eng	Tom is going to be making more money than me this year.
6431689	eng	Tom has three children at home and one away at college.
6431690	eng	Tom has been Mary's next-door neighbor for three years.
6431691	eng	Tom has always had a problem with knowing when to stop.
6431692	eng	Tom gave me his notebook with all his favorite recipes.
6431693	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to and from work.
6431694	eng	Tom doesn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431695	eng	Tom doesn't like it when his wife kisses him in public.
6431696	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to eat dinner with her boss.
6431697	eng	Tom and Mary spent all morning discussing that problem.
6431698	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends I can talk to.
6431699	eng	Not only does Tom speak French, he also speaks English.
6431700	eng	My parents weren't the ones who taught me how to drive.
6431701	eng	My guess is that Tom won't do what you asked him to do.
6431702	eng	Mary shaves her legs more often than Alice shaves hers.
6431703	eng	Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning.
6431704	eng	It's going to take you at least three hours to do that.
6431705	eng	It's going to take us several weeks to finish this job.
6431706	eng	It's going to take three hours to finish these repairs.
6431707	eng	It's going to cost you a lot to furnish your apartment.
6431708	eng	If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
6431709	eng	I've only met Tom once, but she seemed like a nice guy.
6431710	eng	I'd be grateful to you if you could teach me how to drive.
6431711	eng	I want to know if you know who broke my kitchen window.
6431712	eng	I used to see Tom jogging past my house in the morning.
6431713	eng	I thought flying to Boston would cost more than it did.
6431714	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you won't do that.
6431715	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't do that.
6431716	eng	I swore I'd never kiss Tom, but I ended up kissing him.
6431717	eng	I just don't know why Tom doesn't want me to help Mary.
6431718	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary have ever kissed each other.
6431719	eng	How much would you be willing to pay for me to do that?
6431720	eng	How long did it take you to finish writing this report?
6431721	eng	All the boys in Mary's class wanted to go out with her.
6431722	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him that you miss him?
6431723	eng	Why are you always so interested in what Tom is doing?
6431724	eng	While Tom was having a good time, Mary stayed at home.
6431725	eng	What Tom really needs now is a little time by himself.
6431726	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that today if he didn't have to.
6431727	eng	Tom works for a company that sells building materials.
6431728	eng	Tom won't be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431729	eng	Tom went to Mary's house to play video games with her.
6431730	eng	Tom wasn't able to help us today, because he was busy.
6431731	eng	Tom was looking forward to spending the day with Mary.
6431732	eng	Tom told me that he wanted to buy a necklace for Mary.
6431733	eng	Tom told me that Mary said she was sick of doing that.
6431734	eng	Tom told me he wanted to buy a couple of loaves bread.
6431735	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd eat anything she made for him.
6431736	eng	Tom told Mary that he had to eat dinner with his boss.
6431737	eng	Tom suggested that I read the contract very carefully.
6431738	eng	Tom spent the money Mary gave him on something to eat.
6431739	eng	Tom says that Mary will eat lunch with John and Alice.
6431740	eng	Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431741	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't eat all the potato chips.
6431742	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very sorry for what he'd done.
6431743	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very interested in doing that.
6431744	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that we could be there.
6431745	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that he didn't do that.
6431746	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary had to do that.
6431747	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary could speak French.
6431748	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't likely do that by herself.
6431749	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be willing to help us.
6431750	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't likely ready to do that yet.
6431751	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't at this afternoon's meeting.
6431752	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still studying French.
6431753	eng	Tom said that Mary was pretty good at speaking French.
6431754	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to go see John in Boston.
6431755	eng	Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
6431756	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be doing that today.
6431757	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6431758	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
6431759	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in doing that.
6431760	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
6431761	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was in her office on Mondays.
6431762	eng	Tom said he thought I might want to do that by myself.
6431763	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that today.
6431764	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that today.
6431765	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be allowed to do that.
6431766	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that this week.
6431767	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that by myself.
6431768	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that this week.
6431769	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that by myself.
6431770	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to help us today.
6431771	eng	Tom knew that Mary was going to be at today's meeting.
6431772	eng	Tom knew that I'd be able to do that faster than Mary.
6431773	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6431774	eng	Tom is the only one who thinks that's going to happen.
6431775	eng	Tom is probably only going to sleep about three hours.
6431776	eng	Tom is probably going to get punished if he does that.
6431777	eng	Tom is probably going to get arrested if he does that.
6431778	eng	Tom is probably going to be starved when he gets home.
6431779	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without help.
6431780	eng	Tom is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.
6431781	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6431782	eng	Tom is going to want to know more about what happened.
6431783	eng	Tom is going to graduate from high school this spring.
6431784	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for you when you get there.
6431785	eng	Tom is going to be staying at least until next Monday.
6431786	eng	Tom is going to be in prison for the rest of his life.
6431787	eng	Tom is going to be here for at least three more years.
6431788	eng	Tom is going to be heading back to Boston after lunch.
6431789	eng	Tom is going to be arriving by train tomorrow evening.
6431790	eng	Tom is going to be able to solve the problem, I think.
6431791	eng	Tom hasn't even read the first page of the report yet.
6431792	eng	Tom has been talking to Mary for the past three hours.
6431793	eng	Tom gave me his notebook full of his favorite recipes.
6431794	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be coming in this morning.
6431795	eng	Tom didn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431796	eng	Tom bought an old bus and is using it as storage shed.
6431797	eng	Tom and Mary ended up falling in love with each other.
6431798	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never to see each other again.
6431799	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John when he was three years old.
6431800	eng	This is a picture of the guitar I bought last weekend.
6431801	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary wants to eat Thai food for lunch.
6431802	eng	Mary ran into one of her ex-boyfriends at Tom's party.
6431803	eng	Mary must've been very beautiful when she was younger.
6431804	eng	It's probably going to be possible for you to do that.
6431805	eng	It's probably going to be possible for Tom to do that.
6431806	eng	It's not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431807	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to do that.
6431808	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to do that.
6431809	eng	It's going to take me at least three hours to do that.
6431810	eng	It's going to take a lot of time to finish doing that.
6431811	eng	If the weather is good, let's walk to school tomorrow.
6431812	eng	I've been waiting for you to tell me what I should do.
6431813	eng	I'm fairly certain that Tom wouldn't help you do that.
6431814	eng	I wouldn't have lied if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431815	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that when he was in Boston.
6431816	eng	I wonder if Tom knows Mary ate both of his sandwiches.
6431817	eng	I think you need to tell Tom that you're in love with Mary.
6431818	eng	I heard that both Tom and Mary don't know how to swim.
6431819	eng	I don't think we should ask Tom to pay for everything.
6431820	eng	I don't think Tom loves Mary as much as she loves him.
6431821	eng	I don't know what I can do to convince Tom to help us.
6431822	eng	How often do you give advice to people you don't know?
6431823	eng	How much time will it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431824	eng	How much time will it take Tom to hang up the laundry?
6431825	eng	How much money do you think will be needed to do that?
6431826	eng	How much money do you estimate you'll need to do that?
6431827	eng	How much does Tom get paid to babysit Mary's children?
6431828	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will be in Boston?
6431829	eng	How long does it usually take you to do your homework?
6431830	eng	How long do you think you'll be able to help us today?
6431831	eng	How long do you think it would take to read this book?
6431832	eng	How long do you think Tom has spent helping us so far?
6431833	eng	How long do you estimate it'll take to paint my house?
6431834	eng	Have you shown Tom the pictures you took last weekend?
6431835	eng	Has anything out of the ordinary happened here lately?
6431836	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you do that.
6431837	eng	All Tom wanted was to spend some time with his family.
6431838	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom that you didn't like him.
6431839	eng	You should've thought about that before you did that.
6431840	eng	Would you be able to come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
6431841	eng	Worrying about that's been keeping me awake at night.
6431842	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's happening?
6431843	eng	Tom would do practically anything to make Mary happy.
6431844	eng	Tom would do practically anything to keep Mary happy.
6431845	eng	Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431846	eng	Tom won't be able to buy what he needs at this store.
6431847	eng	Tom will be really tired when he gets home, won't he?

6431920	eng	Tom is going to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?

6431932	eng	One of my favorite things about Boston is the people.
6431933	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary will eat lunch with us tomorrow.
6431934	eng	Mary told Tom that John wasn't her boyfriend anymore.
6431935	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't like each other.
6431936	eng	It's going to take too much time for Tom to get here.
6431937	eng	It's going to take a long time for me to finish this.
6431938	eng	It's going to take Tom a couple of hours to get here.
6431939	eng	It's going to cost about thirty dollars to repair it.
6431940	eng	It's been a long time since I've been back to Boston.
6431941	eng	I'm scared to death right now, to be honest with you.
6431942	eng	I'm only telling you this because I'm your friend.
6431943	eng	I think you should tell Tom that you don't like Mary.
6431944	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom go to Boston by himself.
6431945	eng	I think Tom kissed Mary for the first time yesterday.
6431946	eng	I think Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
6431947	eng	I haven't decided whether to go college or get a job.
6431948	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what happened.
6431949	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up anytime soon.
6431950	eng	I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
6431951	eng	I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
6431952	eng	How much time did it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431953	eng	How much time did it take Tom to hang up the laundry?
6431954	eng	How much should I pay Tom to help me paint my garage?

6431959	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to be a French teacher?
6431960	eng	Are you sure it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?
6431961	eng	Apparently, Tom and Mary talked about that on Monday.
6431962	eng	"Is Mary your girlfriend?" "No, she's just a friend."
6431963	eng	You could've let me know you were going out tonight.
6431964	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's going on?
6431965	eng	Why don't you call Tom and invite him to your party?
6431966	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't live in Boston anymore?
6431967	eng	Who did Tom say was going to go to Boston with Mary?
6431968	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got jealous.
6431969	eng	When Tom got home, his children were already asleep.
6431970	eng	What do you think Tom will do now that he's retired?
6431971	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't need to.
6431972	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't have to.

6431975	eng	Tom won't make you do anything you don't want to do.
6431976	eng	Tom won't be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431977	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to get any money for doing that.
6431978	eng	Tom was walking too fast for Mary catch up with him.
6431979	eng	Tom was supposed to babysit our children last night.
6431980	eng	Tom was afraid that he was about to lose everything.
6431981	eng	Tom wanted to practice French with a native speaker.
6431982	eng	Tom thought the boy he saw talking to Mary was John.
6431983	eng	Tom thought Mary was going to let him go home early.
6431984	eng	Tom thought Mary lied to him about where she'd been.
6431985	eng	Tom thinks that Mary will eat what he makes for her.
6431986	eng	Tom stole something from the store where Mary works.
6431987	eng	Tom says it doesn't matter to him if Mary does that.
6431988	eng	Tom says he needs the rest of the money you owe him.
6431989	eng	Tom says he has to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431990	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let John drive.
6431991	eng	Tom says he and his wife haven't yet discussed that.
6431992	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary was in love with John.
6431993	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she ought to do.
6431994	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still in her office.
6431995	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be hesitant to do that.
6431996	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be having a lot of fun.
6431997	eng	Tom said that Mary said she was hoping we'd do that.
6431998	eng	Tom said that Mary said she didn't care what we did.
6431999	eng	Tom said it was Mary who ate the last piece of cake.
6432000	eng	Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
6432001	eng	Tom said he thought that Mary had already done that.
6432002	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't forget to do that.
6432003	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that.
6432004	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was still living in Boston.

6432009	eng	Tom loved living on the ranch with his grandparents.

6432011	eng	Tom listened carefully, but he didn't hear anything.
6432012	eng	Tom knew that the package on the desk was from Mary.
6432013	eng	Tom just got a job working for an insurance company.

6432022	eng	Tom is never going to be able to keep this a secret.
6432023	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that by himself.

6432041	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary should eat so much junk food.
6432042	eng	Tom could hear what was being said in the next room.
6432043	eng	Tom can't do that alone. Mary will have to help him.
6432044	eng	Tom called to say wouldn't be back until after 2:30.
6432045	eng	Tom called to say he wouldn't be back till tomorrow.
6432046	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to go to Boston with Mary.

6432048	eng	Tom and Mary spent the evening watching TV together.
6432049	eng	Tom and Mary ended up getting married to each other.
6432050	eng	Tom and Mary are sitting under that tree over there.
6432051	eng	There are lots of people who could help you do that.
6432052	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been accused of doing that.
6432053	eng	My parents wouldn't let me drive until I was twenty.
6432054	eng	Mary's husband was here a while ago looking for her.
6432055	eng	Mary is a nice girl, except that she talks too much.
6432056	eng	It's going to take me a good three hours to do that.

6432062	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what needs to be done.
6432063	eng	I wonder if Tom really wants us to do that for Mary.
6432064	eng	I wish you hadn't lied to me about where you'd been.
6432065	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to drive.
6432066	eng	I understand French, but I can't speak it very well.
6432067	eng	I thought Tom would apologize to Mary, but he didn't.
6432068	eng	I thought Tom knew why we couldn't do that for Mary.
6432069	eng	I think you should tell Tom why you don't like Mary.
6432070	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom play with Mary anymore.
6432071	eng	I think that Tom lied to you about when he did that.
6432072	eng	I think Tom will do the same thing he did yesterday.
6432073	eng	I still drive that old truck my grandfather gave me.
6432074	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure that I love him.

6432084	eng	You promised me you'd look after the kids tomorrow.
6432085	eng	You could've let me know you were going to be late.
6432086	eng	Who did Tom think would want to go there with Mary?
6432087	eng	We won't be able to do that if Tom doesn't help us.
6432088	eng	We need to find out where Tom wants us to meet him.
6432089	eng	We need to buy another file cabinet for the office.

6432194	eng	Someone who knows French well must've written this.

6432222	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you've done for Mary.
6432223	eng	I'd be grateful to you if you could teach me to drive.
6432224	eng	I would've let Tom drive if I'd known he wanted to.

6432230	eng	I hope you haven't forgotten about today's meeting.
6432231	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what we did.
6432232	eng	I don't think these are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6432233	eng	I didn't think it was a good idea to let Tom drive.
6432234	eng	How much money do you think you'll need to do that?

6432572	eng	You haven't forgotten to pay the rent, have you?
6432573	eng	You don't have to help Tom if you don't want to.
6432574	eng	Would you like me to pick you up at the airport?
6432575	eng	Why don't you like to speak in French in public?
6432576	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you can't drive?
6432577	eng	Why don't you just tell Tom you don't like Mary?

6432777	eng	It's going to take all afternoon and maybe more.
6432778	eng	It's going to happen, but just not anytime soon.

6432792	eng	I thought Mary would like the gift Tom gave her.
6432793	eng	I thought Mary said she didn't have a boyfriend.
6432794	eng	I think your baby is crying because he's hungry.
6432795	eng	I think you should try to persuade Tom to drive.
6432796	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that by himself.

6433039	eng	Mary asked Tom if he thought she was beautiful.
6433040	eng	It's probably going to rain tomorrow afternoon.

6433042	eng	It's probably going to be expensive to do that.
6433043	eng	It's probably going to be dangerous to do that.
6433044	eng	It's going to take me several hours to do that.
6433045	eng	It's going to cause me problems if you do that.
6433046	eng	It's going to be easier if we do that together.
6433047	eng	It's going to be done by the time you get here.
6433048	eng	It's been years since I've been back to Boston.

6433050	eng	It seems I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6433051	eng	It seems I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6433052	eng	I'm very sure that Tom won't help Mary do that.
6433053	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for Mary.
6433054	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6433055	eng	I would strongly advise you to stop doing that.
6433056	eng	I was born in Boston, but I grew up in Chicago.
6433057	eng	I think the whole thing was a misunderstanding.
6433058	eng	I think that Tom lied to you about what he did.
6433059	eng	I think Tom would like you to do that for Mary.
6433060	eng	I think Tom would like Mary to do that for him.
6433061	eng	I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.

6433065	eng	I still watch TV, but not as much as I used to.
6433066	eng	I still have the same questions I asked before.
6433067	eng	I've visited Tom a number of times in Boston.
6433068	eng	I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
6433069	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that.
6433070	eng	I don't have many friends who can speak French.
6433071	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive.
6433072	eng	I can show you around town if you'd like me to.
6433073	eng	How often does Tom wear that tie Mary gave him?
6433074	eng	How much would you pay for something like that?
6433075	eng	How much would you charge me to paint my house?

6433086	eng	Either Tom doesn't want to do that or he can't.
6433087	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you help Mary?
6433088	eng	Could what happened in Boston also happen here?
6433089	eng	As far as I know, Tom has never studied French.
6433090	eng	As far as I know, Tom has never been to Boston.
6433091	eng	Aren't you the one who taught Tom how to drive?
6433092	eng	Are you sure that Tom was the one who did that?
6433093	eng	A girl named Mary said she was looking for you.
6433094	eng	Your French isn't good enough to get that job.
6433095	eng	You'd really better stop doing that right now.
6433096	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about what we did.
6433097	eng	Wouldn't it be better for us to do that today?
6433098	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom doing that?
6433099	eng	When was the last time Tom ate lunch with you?
6433100	eng	When do you think Tom will want us to do that?
6433101	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he smiled.
6433102	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a teenager.
6433103	eng	What's the best way to get downtown from here?
6433104	eng	What time do you usually get home from school?
6433105	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to donate money?
6433106	eng	Tom wouldn't let anybody do anything for Mary.
6433107	eng	Tom won't find anyone who'll do that for Mary.
6433108	eng	Tom will try to talk to Mary about that today.
6433109	eng	Tom will show us the documents this afternoon.
6433110	eng	Tom will definitely not allow Mary to do that.

6433163	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would eat what he made.
6433164	eng	Tom parked his car in front of a fire hydrant.
6433165	eng	Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
6433166	eng	Tom never expected Mary to eat all the donuts.

6433170	eng	Tom knows who Mary hopes asks her to the prom.
6433171	eng	Tom knew that something terrible had happened.
6433172	eng	Tom isn't the only person Mary should talk to.
6433173	eng	Tom is still just a kid, so let's forgive him.
6433174	eng	Tom is probably going to volunteer to do that.

6433205	eng	Tom is afraid to walk through the woods alone.
6433206	eng	Tom hasn't yet told me who helped him do that.
6433207	eng	Tom has been working for an insurance company.
6433208	eng	Tom has been wondering what might happen next.
6433209	eng	Tom has been waiting for Mary for a long time.
6433210	eng	Tom has been trying to convince us to do that.
6433211	eng	Tom has been trying to convince me to do that.
6433212	eng	Tom has been staying with his uncle in Boston.
6433213	eng	Tom has been staying at a hotel near my house.
6433214	eng	Tom has been practicing the piano all morning.

6433217	eng	Tom has been Mary's boyfriend for a long time.
6433218	eng	Tom hardly ever spends time with his children.
6433219	eng	Tom got here about fifteen minutes after Mary.
6433220	eng	Tom drove to the hospital as fast as he could.
6433221	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to work.
6433222	eng	Tom doesn't understand why Mary acts that way.
6433223	eng	Tom doesn't often talk about his private life.
6433224	eng	Tom didn't really seem to be enjoying himself.
6433225	eng	Tom could've been there, but I didn't see him.
6433226	eng	Tom carefully planned what he was going to do.
6433227	eng	Tom asked Mary to lie about where they'd been.
6433228	eng	Tom apparently wants to go to Boston with you.
6433229	eng	Tom and Mary were alone together on the porch.
6433230	eng	Tom and Mary don't usually eat out on Mondays.
6433231	eng	There are lots of people who wouldn't do that.
6433232	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends here.
6433233	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is skating.
6433234	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is fishing.
6433235	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is camping.
6433236	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has the right to do that.
6433237	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been told to do that.
6433238	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want to go with us.
6433239	eng	Mary's oldest son looks just like her husband.
6433240	eng	Mary's husband died three hours after she did.
6433241	eng	Mary's boyfriend is a lot younger than she is.
6433242	eng	Mary told Tom not to kiss her in public again.
6433243	eng	Mary told Tom about what John asked her to do.
6433244	eng	Mary thought Tom was going to do that for her.
6433245	eng	Mary never told us that Tom was her boyfriend.
6433246	eng	Mary dated Tom's brother before she dated him.
6433247	eng	Mary asked Tom to pretend to be her boyfriend.
6433248	eng	It's probably going to be easy for Tom to win.
6433249	eng	It's going to take Tom a long time to do that.
6433250	eng	It's going to be almost impossible to do that.
6433251	eng	It's been three weeks since Tom has been here.
6433252	eng	It's a good thing that you did that yesterday.
6433253	eng	It's a good thing that Tom did that yesterday.
6433254	eng	It'll take us at least three hours to do that.
6433255	eng	It looks as if Tom won't go to Boston with us.
6433256	eng	In October of 2013, Tom retired from coaching.
6433257	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from professional tennis.
6433258	eng	In 2013, Tom married Mary and moved to Boston.
6433259	eng	If Tom goes to the zoo with you, I'll go, too.
6433260	eng	I'm sure Tom will be hungry when he gets home.
6433261	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you do for Mary.
6433262	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for him.
6433263	eng	I'm not going to let Tom drive my car anymore.
6433264	eng	I'm glad you're coming to visit us next month.
6433265	eng	I'm fairly certain that's not going to happen.
6433266	eng	I wouldn't have let Tom drive if I'd been you.
6433267	eng	I wouldn't be able to do that even if I tried.
6433268	eng	I wonder what Tom will do with all that money.
6433269	eng	I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
6433270	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to come here tomorrow.
6433271	eng	I thought you said you wouldn't let Tom drive.
6433272	eng	I think you need to stop doing that right now.
6433273	eng	I think Tom knows he needs to help Mary today.
6433274	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to get here earlier.
6433275	eng	I still wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6433276	eng	I often recommend your website to my students.
6433277	eng	I never even got to tell Tom that I loved him.
6433278	eng	I hope Tom doesn't think we've forgotten Mary.
6433279	eng	I don't think Tom would like it if I did that.
6433280	eng	I don't think Tom will study French next year.
6433281	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
6433282	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you do that.
6433283	eng	I don't know where Tom will be this afternoon.
6433284	eng	I didn't know you were going to let Tom drive.
6433285	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to let Mary drive.
6433286	eng	How much of a discount do you think I can get?
6433287	eng	How much fun do you think Tom's party will be?
6433288	eng	How many pictures have you taken so far today?
6433289	eng	How many patients did Dr. Jackson treat today?
6433290	eng	How long does it usually take to rotate tires?
6433291	eng	How did Tom react when he saw Mary doing that?
6433292	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you.
6433293	eng	Don't think that I'm going to let you do that.
6433294	eng	Don't put your books on the dining room table.
6433295	eng	Don't forget that you need to buy some onions.
6433296	eng	Do you think we should take umbrellas with us?
6433297	eng	Do you really think Tom will be here tomorrow?
6433298	eng	All the boys in Mary's class think she's cute.
6433299	eng	You should let Tom know that you can't drive.
6433300	eng	You should let Tom know that Mary will drive.
6433301	eng	You should get Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433302	eng	You should ask Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433303	eng	You don't really need to lose weight, do you?
6433304	eng	You don't know when Tom will do that, do you?
6433305	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't do that anymore?
6433306	eng	Why are you glad that that's going to happen?
6433307	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a student.
6433308	eng	What Tom wanted was to another piece of cake.
6433309	eng	We didn't know whether Tom was dead or alive.
6433310	eng	Tom wondered why Mary wanted to study French.
6433311	eng	Tom will unlikely be able to help Mary today.
6433312	eng	Tom will have to take better care of himself.

6433317	eng	Tom went back to his car to get his umbrella.
6433318	eng	Tom wasn't expecting you to do that for Mary.
6433319	eng	Tom was the one who taught me how to do this.
6433320	eng	Tom was hoping Mary would eat lunch with him.
6433321	eng	Tom was afraid that he might lose everything.
6433322	eng	Tom wanted to know what had happened to Mary.
6433323	eng	Tom tried to get Mary to cook dinner for him.
6433324	eng	Tom told me the boy talking to Mary was John.

6433326	eng	Tom told me he wanted me to do that for Mary.
6433327	eng	Tom told Mary to eat everything on her plate.
6433328	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want anything to eat.

6433331	eng	Tom swore that Mary told him she'd done that.
6433332	eng	Tom suggested that I read the contract again.

6433340	eng	Tom said that he was very anxious to do that.
6433341	eng	Tom said that he was the last one to do that.
6433342	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary would be early.
6433343	eng	Tom said that Mary was very unlikely do that.
6433344	eng	Tom said that Mary was too stupid to do that.
6433345	eng	Tom said that Mary was too sleepy to do that.

6433485	eng	I'm sure Tom will be tired when he gets home.
6433486	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom won't be at Mary's party.
6433487	eng	I'm absolutely positive that Tom can do that.
6433488	eng	I wouldn't be able to go even if I wanted to.
6433489	eng	I wonder which bicycles are Tom's and Mary's.
6433490	eng	I wasn't the one who taught Tom how to drive.
6433491	eng	I wanted to kiss Tom yesterday, but I didn't.
6433492	eng	I thought you said you'd never let Tom drive.
6433493	eng	I thought Tom said that Mary was from Boston.
6433494	eng	I thought Tom said he needed to buy a shovel.
6433495	eng	I think you should stop doing that right now.
6433496	eng	I think Tom will do that in Boston next week.
6433497	eng	I think Tom will be hungry when he gets home.
6433498	eng	I think Tom needs to talk to Mary personally.
6433499	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to ask him to stay.
6433500	eng	I ran into some friends at the train station.
6433501	eng	I never thought I'd run into Tom in the park.
6433502	eng	I know Tom wants us to go swimming with Mary.
6433503	eng	I knew that Tom wouldn't kiss Mary goodnight.
6433504	eng	I just hope Tom does what we asked him to do.
6433505	eng	I first met Tom at a football game in Boston.
6433506	eng	I don't think that Tom would ever leave Mary.
6433507	eng	I don't think Tom should've let Mary do that.
6433508	eng	I don't know who kissed Tom and I don't care.
6433509	eng	I don't know how Tom did that, but he did it.
6433510	eng	I don't hug my children as often as I should.
6433511	eng	I convinced Tom to lie about where he'd been.
6433512	eng	I can show you around town if you want me to.
6433513	eng	I bought these flowers for Mary, not for you.
6433514	eng	How many times a day do you check your email?
6433515	eng	How many more months will Tom stay in Boston?
6433516	eng	How long will it take you to clean your room?
6433517	eng	How long does Tom expect us to wait for Mary?
6433518	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French before?
6433519	eng	Dr. Jackson doesn't have any female patients.
6433520	eng	Does Tom really think Mary enjoys doing that?
6433521	eng	Do you think you could persuade Tom to drive?
6433522	eng	Do you think Tom would teach me how to drive?
6433523	eng	Do you really think Tom will help us do that?
6433524	eng	Did you do anything interesting last weekend?
6433525	eng	Did Tom say anything about who was with Mary?
6433526	eng	Did Tom say anything about who Mary was with?
6433527	eng	Did Tom actually see Mary eating my sandwich?
6433528	eng	Could what happened to Tom also happen to us?
6433529	eng	Ask Tom if Mary will eat lunch with us today.
6433530	eng	Are you sure you don't mind me tagging along?
6433531	eng	Are you going to tell Tom that you love Mary?
6433532	eng	Would you like me to teach you how to drive?
6433533	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom was born?
6433534	eng	Why is Tom glad that that's going to happen?
6433535	eng	What have you accomplished so far this week?
6433536	eng	What I'd really like is a hot cup of coffee.
6433537	eng	We're getting the results that we hoped for.
6433538	eng	Was Tom the one who taught you how to drive?
6433539	eng	Tom's oldest daughter looks a lot like Mary.
6433540	eng	Tom wouldn't lend Mary the books she wanted.
6433541	eng	Tom works for a company that sells charcoal.
6433542	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was eating by herself.
6433543	eng	Tom won't likely be able to help Mary today.

6433732	eng	Speaking a foreign language well isn't easy.
6433733	eng	Please make sure Tom doesn't leave his room.
6433734	eng	Nothing is going to stop me from doing that.
6433735	eng	Nothing is going to keep me from doing that.

6433760	eng	Last summer, I moved to Boston from Chicago.
6433761	eng	Last summer, I moved from Boston to Chicago.
6433762	eng	It's probably going to be unsafe to do that.
6433763	eng	It's probably going to be tiring to do that.
6433764	eng	It's probably going to be boring to do that.
6433765	eng	It's only going to take a couple of minutes.
6433766	eng	It's just going to take about three minutes.
6433767	eng	It's going to take three hours to get there.

6433770	eng	I'm sure Tom will have no desire to do that.
6433771	eng	I'm not going to let Tom drive my car again.
6433772	eng	I'm glad I lied to Tom about where I'd been.
6433773	eng	I'll give these books to whoever wants them.
6433774	eng	I'd be very surprised if Tom didn't do that.
6433775	eng	I wonder which jackets are Tom's and Mary's.
6433776	eng	I wonder whether Tom would really help Mary.
6433777	eng	I wonder what made Tom lie to us about that.
6433778	eng	I was waiting for you to tell me what to do.
6433779	eng	I was really scared Tom was going to hit me.
6433780	eng	I was going to tell Tom about that tomorrow.

6433810	eng	A burglar broke into Tom's house last night.
6433811	eng	You're not going to let Tom drive, are you?
6433812	eng	You should let Tom know that you can drive.
6433813	eng	You haven't forgotten to do that, have you?
6433814	eng	Why don't you go to the zoo with Tom today?
6433815	eng	Why doesn't Tom want Mary to eat with John?
6433816	eng	Why didn't you say that in the first place?
6433817	eng	Where did you stay when you were in Boston?
6433818	eng	When it stops raining, let's go for a walk.
6433819	eng	When do you think Tom will want to do that?
6433820	eng	When Tom got home, Mary was already asleep.
6433821	eng	What time do you usually get off from work?
6433822	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to volunteer?
6433823	eng	We're a better team than we were last year.

6434004	eng	Tom didn't turn up at the party last night.

6434022	eng	There's nothing I like more than spaghetti.
6434023	eng	There are several possible ways to do that.
6434024	eng	The doctor says that Tom will be all right.
6434025	eng	The children want you to read them a story.
6434026	eng	Tell Tom that we're not going to help Mary.
6434027	eng	Something really should be done about that.
6434028	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has agreed to do that.
6434029	eng	My favorite kind of ice cream is chocolate.

6434059	eng	It's probably going to be raining tomorrow.
6434060	eng	It's probably going to be cheap to do that.
6434061	eng	It's just going to take a few more minutes.
6434062	eng	It's going to take us hours to finish this.
6434063	eng	It's going to stop snowing sooner or later.
6434064	eng	It's going to cost you more to go by plane.
6434065	eng	It's going to cost at least thirty dollars.
6434066	eng	It's been a while since I've talked to Tom.
6434067	eng	It might be a good idea to stop doing that.
6434068	eng	Is Tom the one who taught you how to drive?
6434069	eng	I've finished reading the book you lent me.
6434070	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434071	eng	I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
6434072	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't be interested.
6434073	eng	I'm going to buy myself a birthday present.
6434074	eng	I'm absolutely positive that I can do that.
6434075	eng	I'd rather not kiss Tom if I don't have to.
6434076	eng	I wonder if that'll happen in our lifetimes.
6434077	eng	I wish you'd stop lying to us all the time.
6434078	eng	I wish I could help you today, but I can't.
6434079	eng	I wanted to drive, but Tom wouldn't let me.
6434080	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom works.
6434081	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom lives.
6434082	eng	I want to know if Tom knows how to do that.
6434083	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he wouldn't let me.
6434084	eng	I told Tom he could buy whatever he wanted.
6434085	eng	I told Tom he could buy anything he wanted.
6434086	eng	I thought I saw Tom kissing Mary yesterday.
6434087	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom drive anymore.
6434088	eng	I think we all know that that's a bad idea.
6434089	eng	I think Tom won't stop crying anytime soon.
6434090	eng	I think Tom said that Mary was from Boston.
6434091	eng	I think Tom said he needed to buy a shovel.
6434092	eng	I spend a lot of time doing things for Tom.
6434093	eng	I sang in the church choir for three years.
6434094	eng	I intend to lie to Tom about what happened.
6434095	eng	I don't think you should be doing that now.
6434096	eng	I don't think this is exactly what we need.
6434097	eng	I don't think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6434098	eng	I don't think Tom would ever do that again.
6434099	eng	I don't think Tom would be able to help us.
6434100	eng	I don't think Mary would leave her husband.
6434101	eng	I didn't let Tom talk me into helping Mary.
6434102	eng	I didn't allow Tom do what he wanted to do.
6434103	eng	I did know that Tom used to live in Boston.
6434104	eng	How much sugar should I put in your coffee?
6434105	eng	How much more work do you have to do today?
6434106	eng	How much more weight does Tom want to lose?
6434107	eng	How much do you think I could make busking?

6434109	eng	How many pounds do you think I should lose?
6434110	eng	How long did it take you to read that book?
6434111	eng	How long did it take Tom to get here today?
6434112	eng	How did Tom get Mary to eat her vegetables?
6434113	eng	Eventually Tom purchased a house in Boston.
6434114	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you drive?
6434115	eng	Could you please be quiet? Tom is sleeping.
6434116	eng	Are you still working for the same company?
6434117	eng	Are you going to take an umbrella with you?
6434118	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "In the garden."
6434119	eng	You should've asked me to do that for you.

6434121	eng	Would you happen to know why Tom was late?
6434122	eng	Where do you think Tom will go to college?
6434123	eng	When was the last time Tom came to Boston?
6434124	eng	When and where did you and Tom first kiss?
6434125	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to help you?
6434126	eng	We still don't know what Tom will do next.
6434127	eng	We shouldn't tell Tom about what happened.

6434267	eng	Tom is the least likely person to do that.
6434268	eng	Tom is swimming with his kids in the pool.

6434278	eng	Tom is on his way to Mary's apartment now.
6434279	eng	Tom is never going to find out about this.
6434280	eng	Tom is likely going to follow your advice.

6434314	eng	Tom is going to be a good father, I think.
6434315	eng	Tom is expected back in Boston in October.
6434316	eng	Tom is definitely going to try to do that.
6434317	eng	Tom hugged Mary and then got on the train.
6434318	eng	Tom hasn't been married to Mary very long.
6434319	eng	Tom has until Monday to finish the report.
6434320	eng	Tom has tried to kill himself three times.
6434321	eng	Tom has pictures of Mary wearing a bikini.
6434322	eng	Tom has decided to go back home to Boston.

6434324	eng	Tom has been trying to live a normal life.
6434325	eng	Tom has been spending more time with Mary.
6434326	eng	Tom has been ready to do that for a while.
6434327	eng	Tom has asked Mary not to do that anymore.
6434328	eng	Tom has a tattoo of an eagle on his chest.
6434329	eng	Tom found the necklace that Mary had lost.
6434330	eng	Tom fell in love with one of his students.
6434331	eng	Tom fell down the stairs and hurt himself.
6434332	eng	Tom eventually told me what I ought to do.
6434333	eng	Tom doesn't understand why Mary does that.
6434334	eng	Tom doesn't know who's going to help Mary.
6434335	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to eat so much candy.
6434336	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would let him drive.
6434337	eng	Tom didn't say where or when to meet Mary.
6434338	eng	Tom didn't really expect to find anything.
6434339	eng	Tom didn't read the message Mary sent him.
6434340	eng	Tom didn't know what was likely to happen?
6434341	eng	Tom didn't have time to go shopping today.
6434342	eng	Tom didn't get home until late last night.
6434343	eng	Tom didn't expect you to do that for Mary.
6434344	eng	Tom couldn't find his way out of the cave.
6434345	eng	Tom couldn't come today because he's sick.
6434346	eng	Tom could probably teach you how to drive.
6434347	eng	Tom convinced Mary to make him a sandwich.
6434348	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach John how to drive.
6434349	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the park with him.
6434350	eng	Tom and Mary sat side by side on the sofa.
6434351	eng	Tom and Mary hung up the laundry together.
6434352	eng	Tom and Mary don't hug each other anymore.
6434353	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John three years ago.
6434354	eng	Tom and I'll hang up the laundry together.
6434355	eng	Tom agreed to meet with Mary in the lobby.
6434356	eng	They knocked thirty dollars off the price.
6434357	eng	There's nothing I like more than swimming.
6434358	eng	There's not much chance of that happening.
6434359	eng	There's a jewelry store not far from here.
6434360	eng	There was nothing we could do to help Tom.
6434361	eng	The book I bought yesterday was expensive.
6434362	eng	Personally, I think you shouldn't do that.
6434363	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that today.
6434364	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that again.
6434365	eng	Mary's husband told me she wasn't at home.
6434366	eng	Mary will do anything she can to help Tom.
6434367	eng	Mary wasn't a popular girl in high school.
6434368	eng	Mary told Tom she wanted something to eat.
6434369	eng	Mary talked to Tom about that, didn't she?
6434370	eng	Mary showed us a picture of her boyfriend.
6434371	eng	Mary showed me a picture of her boyfriend.
6434372	eng	Mary says she wants to show Tom something.
6434373	eng	Mary plans to break up with her boyfriend.
6434374	eng	Mary looks almost identical to her sister.
6434375	eng	Mary didn't tell me Tom was her boyfriend.
6434376	eng	Mary bought herself a dress for the party.
6434377	eng	Many of Tom's friends think he's a genius.
6434378	eng	It's unlikely that Tom will be here today.
6434379	eng	It's time for the kids to go to bed.
6434380	eng	It's probably going to be safe to do that.
6434381	eng	It's going to take longer than you expect.
6434382	eng	It's going to take a long time to do that.
6434383	eng	It's going to be sunny tomorrow afternoon.
6434384	eng	It's going to be crowded everywhere today.
6434385	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't do that.
6434386	eng	It seems Tom is having trouble doing that.
6434387	eng	It looks like Tom hasn't shaved in a week.
6434388	eng	I've been studying French for three hours.
6434389	eng	I'm sure that Tom won't help Mary do that.
6434390	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if we did that.
6434391	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach you how to drive.
6434392	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will be there tonight.
6434393	eng	I'm going to give all my possessions away.
6434394	eng	I'll tell Tom you're not going to do that.
6434395	eng	I'd rather not do that if I don't have to.
6434396	eng	I'd like to stay here for three more days.
6434397	eng	I wonder if Tom's friends would help Mary.
6434398	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that on Monday.
6434399	eng	I wonder how much Tom got paid to do that.
6434400	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to Mary about that.
6434401	eng	I wish I could do that today, but I can't.
6434402	eng	I was the one who taught Tom how to drive.
6434403	eng	I want to know if you know how to do that.
6434404	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he pushed me away.
6434405	eng	I think that's going to happen quite soon.
6434406	eng	I think Tom should do that somewhere else.
6434407	eng	I think Tom didn't do what he said he did.
6434408	eng	I think Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434409	eng	I think I'll never get used to doing this.
6434410	eng	I suppose I really ought to do that today.
6434411	eng	I really don't like the way Tom does that.
6434412	eng	I never listen to classical music anymore.
6434413	eng	I have a few friends who can speak French.
6434414	eng	I had to drive home because Tom was drunk.
6434415	eng	I find it hard to understand Tom's French.
6434416	eng	I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
6434417	eng	I don't think you should do that with Tom.
6434418	eng	I don't think Tom will be here until 2:30.
6434419	eng	I don't think Tom is obligated to do that.
6434420	eng	I don't really like the way Tom does that.
6434421	eng	I don't always kiss my children goodnight.
6434422	eng	I can't remember what happened after that.
6434423	eng	How much time will it take you to do that?
6434424	eng	How much time will it take Tom to do that?
6434425	eng	How much money do you usually have on you?
6434426	eng	How many times a month does Tom come here?
6434427	eng	How many sandwiches did Tom make for Mary?
6434428	eng	How long have you spent doing that so far?
6434429	eng	How long do you intend to keep doing that?
6434430	eng	How do you think Tom will propose to Mary?
6434431	eng	How did you find out that Tom kissed Mary?
6434432	eng	How did Tom know we were looking for Mary?
6434433	eng	Have you told Tom why you don't like Mary?
6434434	eng	Don't mothers kiss their children anymore?
6434436	eng	Do you think Tom will come to pick you up?
6434437	eng	Do you think Tom is ever going to do that?
6434438	eng	Do you still feel like eating out tonight?
6434439	eng	Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
6434440	eng	Did Tom tell Mary why he ate her sandwich?
6434441	eng	Did Tom ask you to go to Boston with Mary?
6434442	eng	Did Tom ask Mary why she ate his sandwich?
6434443	eng	Could you tell me where I can park my car?
6434444	eng	Can you help me clean up before you leave?
6434445	eng	Are you sure that Tom is Mary's boyfriend?
6434446	eng	About thirty people were severely injured.
6434447	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "On the cheek."
6434448	eng	You're just the person I was looking for.
6434449	eng	You don't speak French very well, do you?
6434450	eng	Would you like me to unwrap that for you?
6434451	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom lives?
6434452	eng	Would it be all right if I let Tom drive?
6434453	eng	Would Tom care if Mary ate lunch with me?
6434454	eng	With friends like Tom, who needs enemies?
6434455	eng	Why isn't Tom hanging up the laundry now?
6434456	eng	Why don't you want to go to school today?
6434457	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't like Boston?
6434458	eng	Why do you let Tom to treat you that way?
6434459	eng	Why didn't you do what I asked you to do?
6434460	eng	Who does Tom think is going to help Mary?
6434461	eng	Who did Tom think would do that for Mary?
6434462	eng	Who did Tom think was going to meet Mary?
6434463	eng	Who did Tom say went to Boston with Mary?

6434468	eng	When was the last time Tom drove a truck?
6434469	eng	When do you think Tom will want to leave?
6434470	eng	When I first met Tom, he was a bartender.
6434471	eng	What do you think Tom's favorite food is?
6434472	eng	What Tom wanted was some peace and quiet.
6434473	eng	We don't know what caused that to happen.
6434474	eng	Tom's wife died three hours after he did.
6434475	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary sing with his band.
6434476	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that now, would he?
6434477	eng	Tom would do anything to keep Mary happy.
6434478	eng	Tom would do anything to make Mary happy.

6434513	eng	Tom spent the next three years in Boston.

6435090	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom let you do that.
6435091	eng	I wouldn't want to do that for a living.
6435092	eng	I wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6435093	eng	I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
6435094	eng	I wonder if you could help me with this.

6435110	eng	I hope Tom does what we asked him to do.
6435111	eng	I have visited Tom many times in Boston.
6435112	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up.
6435113	eng	I don't think Tom would ever forget you.
6435114	eng	I don't think Tom will be too much help.
6435115	eng	I don't think Tom was telling the truth.

6435134	eng	His name is Tom and he's Mary's brother.
6435135	eng	Her name is Mary and she's Tom's sister.

6435146	eng	Are you sure that Tom doesn't like Mary?
6435147	eng	Are you still working at the same place?
6435148	eng	You'd better stop doing that right now.
6435149	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about that.
6435150	eng	You shouldn't have been so mean to Tom.
6435151	eng	You should tell Tom that you love Mary.
6435152	eng	Would you like me to unwrap it for you?
6435153	eng	Why don't you help Tom paint the fence?
6435154	eng	Why do you think Tom shouldn't do that?
6435155	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't trust you?

6435799	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French?
6435800	eng	Give me some time to think about that.

6436013	eng	Tom didn't do that very well, did he?
6436014	eng	Tom didn't come in to work yesterday.
6436015	eng	Tom convinced Mary to tell the truth.
6436016	eng	Tom came here to ask us to help Mary.
6436017	eng	Tom called me at 2:30 in the morning.
6436018	eng	Tom asked me to walk a little slower.
6436019	eng	Tom asked Mary to tell him the truth.
6436020	eng	Tom asked Mary to stay away from him.
6436021	eng	Tom apparently wants to learn French.
6436022	eng	Tom and Mary were alone on the beach.
6436023	eng	Tom and Mary seem like a nice couple.
6436024	eng	Tom and Mary sat at the picnic table.
6436025	eng	Tom and Mary have both eaten already.
6436026	eng	Tom and Mary aren't on the same team.
6436027	eng	Tom and Mary are high school seniors.
6436028	eng	Tom and I haven't discussed that yet.
6436029	eng	Tom almost never kisses his children.
6436030	eng	These suitcases are Tom's and Mary's.
6436031	eng	These are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6436032	eng	These are Tom's and Mary's suitcases.
6436033	eng	There's a perfectly good explanation.
6436034	eng	There's a barbershop across the road.
6436035	eng	There are lots of people who do that.
6436036	eng	The only thing Tom could do was wait.
6436037	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has gone abroad.
6436038	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has found a job.
6436039	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want that.
6436040	eng	Mary thought the man she saw was Tom.
6436041	eng	Mary thought the boy she saw was Tom.
6436042	eng	Mary is kind of beautiful, isn't she?
6436043	eng	Make sure Tom doesn't leave his room.
6436044	eng	Let's keep this up as long as we can.
6436045	eng	It's quite unlikely Tom will do that.
6436046	eng	It's probably going to snow tomorrow.
6436047	eng	It's going to be dark in a few hours.
6436048	eng	It's going to be an interesting game.
6436049	eng	It's fine by me if you don't do that.
6436050	eng	It'll be difficult to find a job now.
6436051	eng	It won't be all that easy to do that.
6436052	eng	It was Tom who kissed Mary yesterday.
6436053	eng	It should be easy for Tom to do that.
6436054	eng	It is inevitable that that'll happen.
6436055	eng	It doesn't make any difference to me.
6436056	eng	I've quit drinking carbonated drinks.
6436057	eng	I've been waiting for you since 2:30.
6436058	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't need to do that.
6436059	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't have to do that.
6436060	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't do that.
6436061	eng	I'm fairly certain that won't happen.
6436062	eng	I'd rather stay home and read a book.
6436063	eng	I'd rather not lie to Tom anymore.
6436064	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed.
6436065	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.
6436066	eng	I wonder whether Tom would help Mary.
6436067	eng	I wish my parents would let me drive.
6436068	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to the police.
6436069	eng	I wish Tom had asked us to help Mary.
6436070	eng	I wish Tom had asked Mary to help us.
6436071	eng	I told Tom that I'd help him do that.
6436072	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that.
6436073	eng	I think this is exactly what we need.
6436074	eng	I think that it was Tom who did that.
6436075	eng	I think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6436076	eng	I think Tom's leg is much better now.
6436077	eng	I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
6436078	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to hug him.
6436079	eng	I think Tom doesn't enjoy doing that.
6436080	eng	I talked to my attorney this morning.
6436081	eng	I know the girl who's talking to Tom.
6436082	eng	I hope you didn't give Tom any money.
6436083	eng	I hope Tom and Mary do that together.
6436084	eng	I hear that you kissed Tom yesterday.
6436085	eng	I haven't seen a good movie recently.
6436086	eng	I don't want to think about that now.
6436087	eng	I don't want to go home empty-handed.
6436088	eng	I don't think you should do that now.
6436089	eng	I don't think Tom would let me drive.
6436090	eng	I don't think Tom will need our help.
6436091	eng	I don't think I should let you drive.
6436092	eng	I don't know where I left my sunglasses.
6436093	eng	I don't know what I was so afraid of.
6436094	eng	I don't have a place to stay tonight.
6436095	eng	I don't feel like doing that anymore.
6436096	eng	I could've lied to you, but I didn't.
6436097	eng	I can't imagine that happening to me.
6436098	eng	I asked Tom to teach me how to drive.
6436099	eng	How much would you pay us to do that?
6436100	eng	How much water does this bucket hold?
6436101	eng	How much time did it take to do that?
6436102	eng	How much snow do you think we'll get?
6436103	eng	How much more do we need to do today?
6436104	eng	How much money have you saved so far?
6436105	eng	How much money has Tom stolen so far?
6436106	eng	How much money does a carpenter make?
6436107	eng	How much money does Tom save a month?
6436108	eng	How much do you make teaching French?
6436109	eng	How much candy do you think Tom eats?
6436110	eng	How much candy did Tom eat yesterday?
6436111	eng	How much can we really depend on Tom?
6436112	eng	How many times a day do you kiss Tom?
6436113	eng	How many pounds have you lost so far?
6436114	eng	How long would it take us to do that?
6436115	eng	How do you know Tom didn't kiss Mary?
6436116	eng	How did you know Tom would kiss Mary?
6436117	eng	How did you get Tom to let you drive?
6436118	eng	Have you told Tom that you love Mary?
6436119	eng	Do you think Tom will let Mary drive?
6436120	eng	Do you think I need to pay this bill?
6436123	eng	Do you and Tom ever discuss politics?
6436124	eng	Do Tom and Mary still live in Boston?
6436125	eng	Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
6436126	eng	Are you still working as a bartender?
6436127	eng	You shouldn't have brought Tom here.
6436128	eng	You should never have let Tom drive.
6436129	eng	You don't have to be so mean to Tom.
6436130	eng	Will Tom drive to Boston by himself?
6436131	eng	Why weren't you in school yesterday?
6436132	eng	Why do you think Tom should do that?
6436133	eng	Why do you think Tom has to do that?
6436134	eng	Who told Tom he could join the team?
6436135	eng	Who kissed Tom first, Mary or Alice?
6436136	eng	Who else would want to see Tom dead?
6436137	eng	Who did Tom say he saw kissing Mary?
6436138	eng	Which one do you think Tom will buy?
6436139	eng	Where do you think Tom will do that?
6436140	eng	When did you start dyeing your hair?
6436141	eng	What's your plan for this afternoon?
6436142	eng	What would Tom say if Mary did that?
6436143	eng	What was Tom doing in Boston anyway?
6436144	eng	What if Tom doesn't know what to do?
6436145	eng	What did you buy at the supermarket?
6436146	eng	What Tom wanted was to be left alone.
6436147	eng	We need to find out where Tom works.
6436148	eng	We need to find out where Tom lives.
6436149	eng	Tom's brother looks a lot like John.
6436150	eng	Tom's boots are near the front door.
6436152	eng	Tom wouldn't have made that mistake.
6436153	eng	Tom wondered what would happen next.
6436154	eng	Tom wondered if Mary could eat pork.
6436155	eng	Tom won't take a vacation this year.

6436158	eng	Tom won't let Mary kiss him anymore.
6436159	eng	Tom won't come back to pick Mary up.
6436160	eng	Tom won't be very impressed by that.
6436161	eng	Tom will probably be pretty nervous.
6436162	eng	Tom will need to do that by himself.
6436163	eng	Tom will learn to drive this summer.
6436164	eng	Tom will help Mary do that, I think.
6436165	eng	Tom will have to start saving money.

6436253	eng	Tom loaded the boxes onto the truck.
6436254	eng	Tom left his umbrella in Mary's car.
6436255	eng	Tom knows you'll never forgive Mary.
6436256	eng	Tom knows that he can count on Mary.

6436461	eng	Do Tom and Mary still live with you?
6436462	eng	Did Tom really lie to me about that?
6436464	eng	You won't be able to do that today.
6436465	eng	You should've kissed Tom goodnight.
6436466	eng	You all don't speak French, do you?
6436467	eng	Why wouldn't Tom want to kiss Mary?

6436693	eng	Tom and Mary go to church together.
6436694	eng	Tom and Mary are kissing right now.
6436695	eng	Tom and I won't walk home together.
6436696	eng	Tom and I ate sandwiches for lunch.
6436697	eng	Tom almost never hugs Mary anymore.
6436698	eng	This is Tom's first time in Boston.
6436699	eng	This bicycle didn't cost that much.
6436700	eng	That boy speaking French is my son.
6436701	eng	Our next meeting will be on Monday.
6436702	eng	Now that's an interesting question.
6436703	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has long hair.
6436704	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has gray hair.
6436705	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has eaten yet.
6436707	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has dark hair.
6436708	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has confessed.
6436709	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been here.
6436710	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has a rowboat.
6436712	eng	My favorite teacher is Mr. Jackson.
6436713	eng	Maybe Tom told Mary sit over there.
6436714	eng	Mary's sister looks a lot like her.
6436715	eng	Mary's husband must be missing her.
6436716	eng	Mary's boyfriend broke up with her.
6436717	eng	Mary would never leave her husband.
6436718	eng	Mary told me Tom was her boyfriend.
6436719	eng	Mary isn't your girlfriend, is she?
6436720	eng	Mary is your girlfriend, isn't she?
6436721	eng	Mary begged Tom not to lie anymore.
6436722	eng	Let me go back and get an umbrella.
6436723	eng	Lend me a hand with this, will you?
6436724	eng	It's no secret that Tom likes Mary.
6436725	eng	It's my intention to do that today.
6436726	eng	It's hard to tell what Tom will do.
6436727	eng	It's going to take time to do that.
6436728	eng	It's going to be tiring to do that.
6436729	eng	It might be easy for us to do that.
6436730	eng	It might be easy for me to do that.
6436731	eng	It might be a good idea to do that.
6436732	eng	It didn't take Tom long to do that.
6436734	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from baseball.
6436735	eng	I've read every one of these books.
6436736	eng	I've never seen that happen before.
6436737	eng	I've become close friends with Tom.
6436738	eng	I'm hoping it'll be sunny tomorrow.
6436739	eng	I'll tell Tom I'm going to do that.
6436740	eng	I'd suggest not doing that anymore.
6436741	eng	I'd expected Tom to lie about that.
6436742	eng	I wonder if Tom would let me drive.
6436743	eng	I won't let Tom drive my car again.
6436744	eng	I won't ever try hugging Tom again.
6436745	eng	I wish I hadn't lied to the police.
6436746	eng	I wish I could live on Park Street.
6436747	eng	I was tempted to lie, but I didn't.
6436748	eng	I usually take a shower before bed.
6436749	eng	I tried to persuade Tom to help me.
6436750	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to help me.
6436751	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to do that.
6436752	eng	I think you should stop doing that.
6436753	eng	I think that this is Tom's bicycle.
6436754	eng	I think I can't afford to buy that.
6436755	eng	I talked to my lawyer this morning.
6436756	eng	I promised Tom that we'd help Mary.
6436757	eng	I often drive over the speed limit.
6436758	eng	I made dinner for Tom Monday night.
6436759	eng	I know Tom will want to go with us.
6436760	eng	I hope it doesn't rain all weekend.
6436761	eng	I hope Tom will do the right thing.
6436762	eng	I hope Tom will be happy in Boston.
6436763	eng	I don't think Tom will forget that.
6436764	eng	I don't think Tom sees it that way.
6436765	eng	I don't think Tom misses Mary much.
6436766	eng	I didn't think you'd let Tom drive.
6436767	eng	I asked Tom to hang up the laundry.
6436768	eng	I asked Tom to buy some rat poison.
6436769	eng	I almost didn't kiss Tom yesterday.
6436770	eng	How often do you hug your children?
6436771	eng	How much more weight should I lose?
6436772	eng	How much money was actually stolen?
6436773	eng	How much money does a teacher make?
6436774	eng	How much money does a plumber make?
6436775	eng	How much money did you spend on it?
6436776	eng	How much coffee do you drink a day?

6436781	eng	How many days ago did you buy milk?
6436782	eng	How do you know what you should do?
6436783	eng	How can people do things like that?
6436784	eng	Give me a hand with this, will you?
6436785	eng	Don't tell me you're already drunk.
6436786	eng	Do you think Tom will let me drive?
6436787	eng	Do you think I need to lose weight?
6436788	eng	Did you hug you children yesterday?
6436789	eng	Did you have a fun time last night?
6436790	eng	Did Tom drive to Boston by himself?
6436791	eng	About thirty people have been hurt.
6436792	eng	A little help would be appreciated.
6436793	eng	You should really stop doing that.
6436794	eng	You didn't sell your car, did you?
6436795	eng	You didn't let Tom drive, did you?
6436796	eng	You didn't hurt yourself, did you?
6436797	eng	Would you please not do that here?
6436798	eng	Why is Tom so hesitant to do that?
6436799	eng	Why is Tom always so mean to Mary?
6436800	eng	Why do girls I don't like like me?
6436801	eng	Why did you turn down their offer?
6436802	eng	Why can't you be more considerate?
6436803	eng	Why are you trying to lose weight?
6436804	eng	Why are you determined to do that?
6436805	eng	Why are you always so pessimistic?
6436806	eng	Why are you always so mean to Tom?
6436807	eng	Who told you Tom didn't kiss Mary?
6436808	eng	Who did Tom think would help Mary?
6436809	eng	When do you think Tom will arrive?
6436810	eng	What's Tom going to cook for Mary?
6436811	eng	What would Tom say if we did that?

6436813	eng	What makes you think Tom is wrong?
6436814	eng	What have you accomplished so far?
6436815	eng	What are you going to buy for Tom?
6436816	eng	What Tom saw changed his life.
6436817	eng	What Tom did didn't surprise Mary.
6436818	eng	We're going to the beach tomorrow.
6436819	eng	We're fortunate to still be alive.
6436820	eng	We'll do that as soon as possible.
6436821	eng	We won't be able to do that today.
6436822	eng	We seldom kiss each other anymore.
6436823	eng	We can't drive across that bridge.
6436824	eng	Tom wouldn't let you guys do that.
6436825	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary go anywhere.
6436826	eng	Tom wouldn't come out of his room.

6436836	eng	Tom will have his house repainted.
6436837	eng	Tom will go to Boston to see Mary.
