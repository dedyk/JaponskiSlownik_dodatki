6431138	eng	"Would you like to go to a movie this weekend?" "I'm sorry I can't, but thanks for asking."
6431139	eng	It's going to take longer to tell you how to do it than to just go ahead and do it myself.

6431141	eng	I told Tom that I didn't think I'd be able to buy what I needed for less than $30.

6431146	eng	It's going to take at least one more hour to finish writing this report.
6431147	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take Tom to finish writing the report?
6431148	eng	The last time I saw Mary she was wearing a pink blouse and a red skirt.
6431149	eng	Mary was the only other girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431150	eng	It's going to take at least another hour to finish writing this report.
6431151	eng	I usually wake up at about six, but I don't get out of bed until seven.
6431152	eng	I can't speak French fluently yet, but I can understand it fairly well.
6431153	eng	How many days do you think it'll take you to finish writing the report?
6431154	eng	Would you be able to come back here tomorrow at 2:30 in the afternoon?
6431155	eng	Mary is the only other girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431156	eng	It's going to take a long time to do everything that needs to be done.
6431157	eng	I usually get up at six, but this morning I didn't get up until eight.
6431158	eng	I don't think it's a good idea for you to go out at night by yourself.
6431159	eng	How many more years do you think it'll take Tom graduate from college?
6431160	eng	It's going to take me at least three hours to do my homework tonight.
6431161	eng	I think you should lie to the police about where you were that night.
6431162	eng	The twins look so much alike that it's difficult to tell them apart.
6431163	eng	Mary wasn't the only girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431164	eng	It's probably going to take you about three hours to read this book.
6431165	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for you to do that by yourself.
6431166	eng	It's going to take me a long time to do all the things I want to do.
6431167	eng	It's going to cost us a lot of money to put a new roof on our house.
6431168	eng	If we don't find water we can drink, we won't survive on his island.
6431169	eng	I suggest that you don't tell Tom about where you spent the weekend.
6431170	eng	Mary isn't the only girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431171	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for Tom to do that by himself.

6431178	eng	Mary's boyfriend saw her dancing with another guy and got jealous.
6431179	eng	It doesn't seem fair not to pay Tom the same as we're paying Mary.
6431180	eng	Does Tom really think he's the only one here who can speak French?
6431181	eng	When was the last time you read a bedtime story to your children?
6431182	eng	The weather's nice and it's our day off, so let's go on a picnic.
6431183	eng	It's going to take some time to shovel all the snow off the roof.
6431184	eng	It's going to take me more than three hours to finish doing this.
6431185	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't understand French.
6431186	eng	I don't think Tom has time today to do everything he needs to do.
6431187	eng	How much time do you think it'll take Tom to finish his homework?
6431188	eng	How much time do you estimate it'll take Tom to build a doghouse?
6431189	eng	After failing to make the Olympic team, Tom retired from fencing.
6431190	eng	Mary is the only girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431191	eng	It's going to take you a few weeks to get used to wearing a wig.
6431192	eng	It's going to take a little time to get used to wearing glasses.
6431193	eng	It's going to be a long time before I can afford to buy a house.
6431194	eng	It doesn't make any difference to me whether you do that or not.
6431195	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what time Tom usually goes to bed.
6431196	eng	I wanted to hug you, but I knew it would embarrass you if I did.
6431197	eng	I think you should tell Tom why you won't go to Boston with him.
6431198	eng	I suggest that you lie to Tom about where you spent the weekend.
6431199	eng	I know Tom lives on Park Street, but I'm not exactly sure where.
6431200	eng	How much time do you estimate Tom will need to build a doghouse?
6431201	eng	How many more hours do you think Tom will be willing to help us?
6431202	eng	Tom told Mary she should lie about who she went to Boston with.
6431203	eng	Tom thinks Mary will lie to John about what happened yesterday.
6431204	eng	Tom takes care of Mary's daughter whenever Mary goes to Boston.
6431205	eng	Tom studied French after dinner while his mother washed dishes.
6431206	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can help you move the piano today.
6431207	eng	Tom said that he's pretty sure that Mary has seen John do that.
6431208	eng	Tom said that he saw Mary eating at a picnic table in the park.
6431209	eng	Tom said he thought there was a chance that Mary would do that.
6431210	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who knew how to do that.
6431211	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to eat anything she doesn't want to.
6431212	eng	Tom probably won't be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431213	eng	Tom parked his car in front of a fire hydrant and got a ticket.
6431214	eng	Tom just closed his eyes and tried to ignore what was going on.
6431215	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431216	eng	Tom is likely going to go to Boston during his summer vacation.
6431217	eng	Tom is likely going to be too busy to do that until after 2:30.
6431218	eng	Tom is going to eventually figure out it was Mary who did that.
6431219	eng	Tom didn't like Mary at all when they were both in high school.
6431220	eng	Tom called Mary to tell her he wouldn't be home until tomorrow.
6431221	eng	Tom and Mary tried to do that by themselves, but they couldn't.
6431222	eng	Tom and Mary moved to Boston where they opened an antique shop.
6431223	eng	How long do you think it would take us to get to Boston by car?
6431224	eng	Tom was the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to drive.
6431225	eng	Tom speaks perfect French, but his native language is English.
6431226	eng	Tom saw Mary sitting by herself on the bench next to the pond.
6431227	eng	Tom said that he wasn't interested in going to Boston with us.
6431228	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary didn't want to do that.
6431229	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary didn't need to do that.
6431230	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary didn't have to do that.
6431231	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary would be afraid to do that.
6431232	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't eat the soup if it had meat in it.
6431233	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be interested in doing that.
6431234	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6431235	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that until October.
6431236	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that until October.
6431237	eng	Tom said he thought I might be permitted to do that by myself.
6431238	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be able to buy what he needed for $300.
6431239	eng	Tom said he didn't think doing that would make any difference.
6431240	eng	Tom probably won't be able to help you clean the garage today.
6431241	eng	Tom knows that he should do something, but he's not sure what.
6431242	eng	Tom knows that he has to do something, but he's not sure what.
6431243	eng	Tom is probably going to get injured if he does that that way.
6431244	eng	Tom is probably going to be doing that early tomorrow morning.
6431245	eng	Tom is likely to lie to Mary about where he spent the weekend.
6431246	eng	Tom is likely going to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
6431247	eng	Tom is likely going to be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6431248	eng	Tom is going to provide you with all the information you need.
6431249	eng	Tom is going to need at least $300 to buy everything he needs.
6431250	eng	Tom is going to leave for Boston first thing tomorrow morning.
6431251	eng	Tom is going to be finished doing that by the end of the week.
6431252	eng	Tom is going to be arriving tomorrow at 2:30 in the afternoon.
6431253	eng	Tom finished reading the letter and put it in his desk drawer.
6431254	eng	Tom and Mary have parties at their home several times a month.
6431255	eng	Tom and Mary are probably never going to see each other again.
6431256	eng	My parents died in an automobile accident when I was thirteen.
6431257	eng	Mary isn't the sort of girl who would do what you say she did.
6431258	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't want to do that together.
6431259	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to finish this job.
6431260	eng	I'm sure I'll eventually go to Boston. I just don't know when.
6431261	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is aware that Mary has been arrested.
6431262	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive your car again.
6431263	eng	How many women have you talked to since you got out of prison?
6431264	eng	How many hours a week do you help out at the homeless shelter?
6431265	eng	You really should lie to Tom about where you were last night.
6431266	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in front of the library at 2:30.
6431267	eng	Tom was walking so fast that Mary couldn't catch up with him.
6431268	eng	Tom texted Mary to let her know that he'd be late for dinner.
6431269	eng	Tom said something to Mary, but I couldn't hear what he said.
6431270	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
6431271	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was always in her office on Mondays.
6431272	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who wanted to do that.
6431273	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who needed to do that.
6431274	eng	Tom said he thought I might be required to do that by myself.
6431275	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to eat anything she didn't want to.
6431276	eng	Tom promised me he'd buy me something to eat on the way home.
6431277	eng	Tom noticed Mary's new hairstyle, but he didn't say anything.
6431278	eng	Tom knows you didn't eat any of the cookies he baked for you.
6431279	eng	Tom knew Mary was looking for him, so he hid in the basement.
6431280	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431281	eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to drive.
6431282	eng	Tom is probably going to figure out it was Mary who did that.
6431283	eng	Tom is going to have to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?
6431284	eng	Tom is going to buy his mother some flowers for Mother's Day.
6431285	eng	Tom is going to be the first one in our class to get married.
6431286	eng	Tom is going to be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
6431287	eng	Tom has been looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431288	eng	Tom couldn't help us today, because he was busy helping Mary.
6431289	eng	Tom and Mary talked on the phone with each other all evening.
6431290	eng	Tom and Mary take a walk together after dinner every evening.
6431291	eng	Tom and Mary started doing that when they were both thirteen.
6431292	eng	Tom and Mary helped their mother decorate the Christmas tree.
6431293	eng	That's an interesting idea, but I don't think we can do that.
6431294	eng	Mary doesn't like it when her boyfriend kisses her in public.
6431295	eng	Mary called her mother and told her she'd be late for dinner.
6431296	eng	It's going to take Tom three hours to finish what he's doing.
6431297	eng	It's going to be difficult to complete this report by Monday.
6431298	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, please wait on the porch.
6431299	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't want to drive.
6431300	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431301	eng	I don't think Tom has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
6431302	eng	I don't have to go into the office until 2:30 this afternoon.
6431303	eng	Apparently, that's the only way we can get that done in time.
6431304	eng	Tom will probably feel better once he gets something to eat.
6431305	eng	Tom was supposed to meet me in the lobby, but he never came.
6431306	eng	Tom was shocked when he learned that Mary had been arrested.
6431307	eng	Tom wanted to do that this afternoon, but I told him not to.
6431308	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't eat the stew if it had pork in it.
6431309	eng	Tom thought that the best solution was to ask Mary to leave.
6431310	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wanted to do that.
6431311	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary needed to do that.
6431312	eng	Tom said he wanted me to help him paint his garage tomorrow.
6431313	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that this afternoon.

6431318	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to eat anything she doesn't like.
6431319	eng	Tom refused to tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431320	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6431321	eng	Tom is probably going to ask Mary for permission to do that.
6431322	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do this.
6431323	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do that.

6431334	eng	There's something on that shelf that both Tom and Mary want.
6431335	eng	The weather's nice and it's my day off, so I'm going hiking.
6431336	eng	The picnic was held in the gymnasium because it was raining.
6431337	eng	Ninety percent of the time Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
6431338	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom was ready to become a father.
6431339	eng	If Tom doesn't get an A on the test, his mother will be mad.
6431340	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you've never done that.
6431341	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't speak French.
6431342	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you eat his piece of cake.

6431351	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably in the cafeteria, eating lunch.
6431352	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wouldn't do that.
6431353	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary had been told not to do that.

6431371	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without your help.
6431372	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without some help.
6431373	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that before lunch.

6431386	eng	Tom and Mary have three children under the age of thirteen.
6431387	eng	The only language I can speak other than French is English.
6431388	eng	It's just not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431389	eng	It's hard to believe that Tom would do something like that.
6431390	eng	It's going to take some time to finish unloading the truck.
6431391	eng	It's going to take a little time to get used to doing this.
6431392	eng	It's going to be a long time before I try doing that again.
6431393	eng	It wasn't clear on Monday whether Tom would do that or not.
6431394	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, just wait on the porch.
6431395	eng	I wouldn't have done that if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431396	eng	I was the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431397	eng	I have a sore throat, so I don't know if I can sing or not.

6431404	eng	Do you really have enough money to buy everything you need?
6431405	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary were going to be there.
6431406	eng	Tom wouldn't be helping us today if Mary hadn't asked him.
6431407	eng	Tom wished he hadn't asked Mary to teach him how to drive.
6431408	eng	Tom wasn't waiting for Mary where he said he'd be waiting.

6431412	eng	Tom wanted to explain everything to Mary, but he couldn't.
6431413	eng	Tom wanted to apologize to Mary, but he couldn't find her.

6431426	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't attend this afternoon's meeting.
6431427	eng	Tom said that Mary could've probably done that by herself.
6431428	eng	Tom said he thought he might be required to do that today.
6431429	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the next one to do that.
6431430	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the last one to do that.
6431431	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the best singer in his class.

6431440	eng	Tom is probably going to sing that new song he just wrote.
6431441	eng	Tom is probably going to go swimming again this afternoon.
6431442	eng	Tom is probably going to be very hungry when he gets home.
6431443	eng	Tom is probably going to be gone by the time we get there.
6431444	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without our help.
6431445	eng	Tom is likely going to spend the rest of his life in jail.
6431446	eng	Tom is going to try to find out why Mary wants to do that.

6431463	eng	My parents died in an automobile accident three years ago.
6431464	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to finish this.
6431465	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
6431466	eng	In case of rain, the picnic will be held in the gymnasium.
6431467	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from boxing and returned to teaching.
6431468	eng	If you do that this way, you'll be able to save some time.
6431469	eng	I can't force you to do that, but you really should do it.
6431470	eng	How old were you when you and Tom first kissed each other?
6431471	eng	How much do you think I should pay Tom to rotate my tires?
6431472	eng	How much did Tom pay you to help him clean out his garage?

6431476	eng	Could you tell me what time the meeting is going to start?

6431501	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be awake when he got home.
6431502	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the best player on the team.

6431538	eng	I've only met Mary once, but she seemed like a nice girl.
6431539	eng	I'm the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431540	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what Tom's phone number is.

6431542	eng	I heard that Tom will play tennis with us this afternoon.
6431543	eng	I haven't seen Tom since we were in high school together.
6431544	eng	I ended up telling Tom what Mary told me not to tell him.
6431545	eng	I don't like lying, but sometimes I think it's necessary.
6431546	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that with Mary.

6431554	eng	Apparently, that's the only way Tom knows how to do that.
6431555	eng	You don't need to buy any sugar. We already have plenty.
6431556	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what the problem is?
6431557	eng	Where were you on October 20th at 2:30 in the afternoon?
6431558	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he started laughing.
6431559	eng	We've been waiting for you to tell us what we should do.
6431560	eng	Tom, Mary and John all live with their father in Boston.

6431618	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to living here.
6431619	eng	It's going to take me a long time to get over this cold.
6431620	eng	It's going to be impossible to do that, don't you think?
6431621	eng	It's going to be impossible for Tom to do that tomorrow.
6431622	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't see Mary kissing John.
6431623	eng	If you ask Tom to lend you some money, he probably will.
6431624	eng	I'd rather not lie to my parents about where we've been.
6431625	eng	I was waiting for you to tell me what needed to be done.
6431626	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom hang out with Mary anymore.
6431627	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure I want to marry him.
6431628	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that for Mary.
6431629	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to go to Boston with Mary.
6431630	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that for Mary.
6431631	eng	How much money will it cost to get that book translated?
6431632	eng	How much money do you estimate Tom will need to do that?
6431633	eng	How long do you think it would take you to mow our lawn?
6431634	eng	Do you think Tom would've wanted us to do that for Mary?
6431635	eng	Do you know why Tom doesn't want me to sit next to Mary?
6431636	eng	Do you know whether or not Tom will sing for us tonight?
6431637	eng	Are you certain it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?
6431638	eng	Apparently, Tom will be going to a university in Boston.
6431639	eng	Tom's house is only about a five-minute walk from here.
6431640	eng	Tom would prefer to study French with a native speaker.
6431641	eng	Tom will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.
6431642	eng	Tom will be mad at Mary when he finds out what she did.
6431643	eng	Tom wasn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6431644	eng	Tom walks his dog every morning before he goes to work.
6431645	eng	Tom told the police that he'd been mugged by three men.
6431646	eng	Tom told me that he and Mary were going to get married.
6431647	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted John to teach him how to drive.
6431648	eng	Tom told Mary he thought they should get back together.
6431649	eng	Tom says he needs to find somebody to do that for Mary.
6431650	eng	Tom said that he was very sure that Mary would do that.
6431651	eng	Tom said that he was responsible for what had happened.
6431652	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary liked him very much.
6431653	eng	Tom said that Mary has been told to do that many times.
6431654	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't eat either of her sandwiches.
6431655	eng	Tom said he'll be ready to go by the time you get here.
6431656	eng	Tom said he'd likely buy some stuff at the flea market.
6431657	eng	Tom said he was going to be in Boston for another week.
6431658	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be upset if he did that.
6431659	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6431660	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be motivated to do that.
6431661	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be desperate to do that.
6431662	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be bored if we did that.
6431663	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't through doing that yet.
6431664	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't going to be doing that.
6431665	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be required to do that.
6431666	eng	Tom said he thought I might be allowed to do that soon.
6431667	eng	Tom noticed Mary's car parked in front of John's house.
6431668	eng	Tom needed to go back to his house to get his passport.
6431669	eng	Tom left his apartment earlier this morning than usual.
6431670	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knows what happened to Mary.
6431671	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
6431672	eng	Tom isn't as interested in doing that as he used to be.
6431673	eng	Tom is trying to figure out how he can make Mary happy.
6431674	eng	Tom is probably going to walk to work tomorrow morning.
6431675	eng	Tom is probably going to to be excused from doing that.
6431676	eng	Tom is probably going to tell you the same thing I did.
6431677	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he'll never do that.
6431678	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he wants to do that.
6431679	eng	Tom is probably going to be present at today's meeting.
6431680	eng	Tom is probably going to be late for work this morning.
6431681	eng	Tom is probably going to be exhausted after doing that.
6431682	eng	Tom is never going to have to worry about going hungry.
6431683	eng	Tom is looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431684	eng	Tom is hoping Mary won't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431685	eng	Tom is going to try to finish writing the report today.
6431686	eng	Tom is going to take a walk in the park this afternoon.
6431687	eng	Tom is going to be out of the office until next Monday.
6431688	eng	Tom is going to be making more money than me this year.
6431689	eng	Tom has three children at home and one away at college.
6431690	eng	Tom has been Mary's next-door neighbor for three years.
6431691	eng	Tom has always had a problem with knowing when to stop.
6431692	eng	Tom gave me his notebook with all his favorite recipes.
6431693	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to and from work.
6431694	eng	Tom doesn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431695	eng	Tom doesn't like it when his wife kisses him in public.
6431696	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to eat dinner with her boss.
6431697	eng	Tom and Mary spent all morning discussing that problem.
6431698	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends I can talk to.
6431699	eng	Not only does Tom speak French, he also speaks English.
6431700	eng	My parents weren't the ones who taught me how to drive.
6431701	eng	My guess is that Tom won't do what you asked him to do.
6431702	eng	Mary shaves her legs more often than Alice shaves hers.
6431703	eng	Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning.
6431704	eng	It's going to take you at least three hours to do that.
6431705	eng	It's going to take us several weeks to finish this job.
6431706	eng	It's going to take three hours to finish these repairs.
6431707	eng	It's going to cost you a lot to furnish your apartment.
6431708	eng	If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
6431709	eng	I've only met Tom once, but she seemed like a nice guy.
6431710	eng	I'd be grateful to you if you could teach me how to drive.
6431711	eng	I want to know if you know who broke my kitchen window.
6431712	eng	I used to see Tom jogging past my house in the morning.
6431713	eng	I thought flying to Boston would cost more than it did.
6431714	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you won't do that.
6431715	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't do that.
6431716	eng	I swore I'd never kiss Tom, but I ended up kissing him.
6431717	eng	I just don't know why Tom doesn't want me to help Mary.
6431718	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary have ever kissed each other.
6431719	eng	How much would you be willing to pay for me to do that?
6431720	eng	How long did it take you to finish writing this report?
6431721	eng	All the boys in Mary's class wanted to go out with her.
6431722	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him that you miss him?
6431723	eng	Why are you always so interested in what Tom is doing?
6431724	eng	While Tom was having a good time, Mary stayed at home.
6431725	eng	What Tom really needs now is a little time by himself.
6431726	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that today if he didn't have to.
6431727	eng	Tom works for a company that sells building materials.
6431728	eng	Tom won't be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431729	eng	Tom went to Mary's house to play video games with her.
6431730	eng	Tom wasn't able to help us today, because he was busy.
6431731	eng	Tom was looking forward to spending the day with Mary.
6431732	eng	Tom told me that he wanted to buy a necklace for Mary.
6431733	eng	Tom told me that Mary said she was sick of doing that.
6431734	eng	Tom told me he wanted to buy a couple of loaves bread.
6431735	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd eat anything she made for him.
6431736	eng	Tom told Mary that he had to eat dinner with his boss.
6431737	eng	Tom suggested that I read the contract very carefully.
6431738	eng	Tom spent the money Mary gave him on something to eat.
6431739	eng	Tom says that Mary will eat lunch with John and Alice.
6431740	eng	Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431741	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't eat all the potato chips.
6431742	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very sorry for what he'd done.
6431743	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very interested in doing that.
6431744	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that we could be there.
6431745	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that he didn't do that.
6431746	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary had to do that.
6431747	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary could speak French.
6431748	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't likely do that by herself.
6431749	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be willing to help us.
6431750	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't likely ready to do that yet.
6431751	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't at this afternoon's meeting.
6431752	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still studying French.
6431753	eng	Tom said that Mary was pretty good at speaking French.
6431754	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to go see John in Boston.
6431755	eng	Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
6431756	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be doing that today.
6431757	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6431758	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
6431759	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in doing that.
6431760	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
6431761	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was in her office on Mondays.
6431762	eng	Tom said he thought I might want to do that by myself.
6431763	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that today.
6431764	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that today.
6431765	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be allowed to do that.
6431766	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that this week.
6431767	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that by myself.
6431768	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that this week.
6431769	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that by myself.
6431770	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to help us today.
6431771	eng	Tom knew that Mary was going to be at today's meeting.
6431772	eng	Tom knew that I'd be able to do that faster than Mary.
6431773	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6431774	eng	Tom is the only one who thinks that's going to happen.
6431775	eng	Tom is probably only going to sleep about three hours.
6431776	eng	Tom is probably going to get punished if he does that.
6431777	eng	Tom is probably going to get arrested if he does that.
6431778	eng	Tom is probably going to be starved when he gets home.
6431779	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without help.
6431780	eng	Tom is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.
6431781	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6431782	eng	Tom is going to want to know more about what happened.
6431783	eng	Tom is going to graduate from high school this spring.
6431784	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for you when you get there.
6431785	eng	Tom is going to be staying at least until next Monday.
6431786	eng	Tom is going to be in prison for the rest of his life.
6431787	eng	Tom is going to be here for at least three more years.
6431788	eng	Tom is going to be heading back to Boston after lunch.
6431789	eng	Tom is going to be arriving by train tomorrow evening.
6431790	eng	Tom is going to be able to solve the problem, I think.
6431791	eng	Tom hasn't even read the first page of the report yet.
6431792	eng	Tom has been talking to Mary for the past three hours.
6431793	eng	Tom gave me his notebook full of his favorite recipes.
6431794	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be coming in this morning.
6431795	eng	Tom didn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431796	eng	Tom bought an old bus and is using it as storage shed.
6431797	eng	Tom and Mary ended up falling in love with each other.
6431798	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never to see each other again.
6431799	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John when he was three years old.
6431800	eng	This is a picture of the guitar I bought last weekend.
6431801	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary wants to eat Thai food for lunch.
6431802	eng	Mary ran into one of her ex-boyfriends at Tom's party.
6431803	eng	Mary must've been very beautiful when she was younger.
6431804	eng	It's probably going to be possible for you to do that.
6431805	eng	It's probably going to be possible for Tom to do that.
6431806	eng	It's not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431807	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to do that.
6431808	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to do that.
6431809	eng	It's going to take me at least three hours to do that.
6431810	eng	It's going to take a lot of time to finish doing that.
6431811	eng	If the weather is good, let's walk to school tomorrow.
6431812	eng	I've been waiting for you to tell me what I should do.
6431813	eng	I'm fairly certain that Tom wouldn't help you do that.
6431814	eng	I wouldn't have lied if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431815	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that when he was in Boston.
6431816	eng	I wonder if Tom knows Mary ate both of his sandwiches.
6431817	eng	I think you need to tell Tom that you're in love Mary.
6431818	eng	I heard that both Tom and Mary don't know how to swim.
6431819	eng	I don't think we should ask Tom to pay for everything.
6431820	eng	I don't think Tom loves Mary as much as she loves him.
6431821	eng	I don't know what I can do to convince Tom to help us.
6431822	eng	How often do you give advice to people you don't know?
6431823	eng	How much time will it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431824	eng	How much time will it take Tom to hang up the laundry?
6431825	eng	How much money do you think will be needed to do that?
6431826	eng	How much money do you estimate you'll need to do that?
6431827	eng	How much does Tom get paid to babysit Mary's children?
6431828	eng	How many more days do you think Tom will be in Boston?
6431829	eng	How long does it usually take you to do your homework?
6431830	eng	How long do you think you'll be able to help us today?
6431831	eng	How long do you think it would take to read this book?
6431832	eng	How long do you think Tom has spent helping us so far?
6431833	eng	How long do you estimate it'll take to paint my house?
6431834	eng	Have you shown Tom the pictures you took last weekend?
6431835	eng	Has anything out of the ordinary happened here lately?
6431836	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you do that.
6431837	eng	All Tom wanted was to spend some time with his family.
6431838	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom that you didn't like him.
6431839	eng	You should've thought about that before you did that.
6431840	eng	Would you be able to come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
6431841	eng	Worrying about that's been keeping me awake at night.
6431842	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's happening?
6431843	eng	Tom would do practically anything to make Mary happy.
6431844	eng	Tom would do practically anything to keep Mary happy.
6431845	eng	Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431846	eng	Tom won't be able to buy what he needs at this store.
6431847	eng	Tom will be really tired when he gets home, won't he?
6431848	eng	Tom wasn't the only boy I kissed. I also kissed John.
6431849	eng	Tom used to make fun of Mary, but he doesn't anymore.
6431850	eng	Tom took care of Mary's cats while she was in Boston.
6431851	eng	Tom told Mary she should eat everything on her plate.
6431852	eng	Tom told Mary she had to eat everything on her plate.
6431853	eng	Tom told Mary he'd lied to her and that he was sorry.
6431854	eng	Tom thought the girl he saw talking to John was Mary.
6431855	eng	Tom says he has to find somebody to do that for Mary.
6431856	eng	Tom said that it looked like Mary was getting sleepy.
6431857	eng	Tom said that it looked like Mary was getting drowsy.

6431865	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she needed to do.
6431866	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably too young to do that.
6431867	eng	Tom said that Mary was happy she was able to do that.
6431868	eng	Tom said that Mary has been to Australia three times.
6431869	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be having much fun.
6431870	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't eat both of her sandwiches.
6431871	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to find another job.
6431872	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be willing to do that.
6431873	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be tempted to do that.
6431874	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous doing that.
6431875	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be frightened by that.
6431876	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be at today's meeting.
6431877	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't interested in sports.
6431878	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the last one to do that.
6431879	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was outside waiting for you.
6431880	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that today.
6431881	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that again.
6431882	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might be tempted to do that.
6431883	eng	Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
6431884	eng	Tom said he didn't know where he should park his car.
6431885	eng	Tom said Mary would unlikely eat anything this spicy.
6431886	eng	Tom refused to tell me who gave him those binoculars.
6431887	eng	Tom ran to the bus stop, so he wouldn't miss the bus.
6431888	eng	Tom ran to the bus stop, but he still missed the bus.
6431889	eng	Tom knows Mary will probably be too busy to help him.
6431890	eng	Tom knew that Mary wouldn't eat the fish he'd caught.
6431891	eng	Tom knew that I was glad that that's going to happen.
6431892	eng	Tom is probably going to stay in Boston until Monday.
6431893	eng	Tom is probably going to have a good time doing that.
6431894	eng	Tom is probably going to get injured if he does that.

6431910	eng	Tom is going to go swimming with us tomorrow morning.

6431913	eng	Tom is going to eventually figure out how to do that.

6431931	eng	Please don't say anything to Tom about what happened.
6431932	eng	One of my favorite things about Boston is the people.
6431933	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary will eat lunch with us tomorrow.
6431934	eng	Mary told Tom that John wasn't her boyfriend anymore.
6431935	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't like each other.
6431936	eng	It's going to take too much time for Tom to get here.
6431937	eng	It's going to take a long time for me to finish this.
6431938	eng	It's going to take Tom a couple of hours to get here.
6431939	eng	It's going to cost about thirty dollars to repair it.
6431940	eng	It's been a long time since I've been back to Boston.
6431941	eng	I'm scared to death right now, to be honest with you.
6431942	eng	I'm only telling you this because I'm your my friend.
6431943	eng	I think you should tell Tom that you don't like Mary.
6431944	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom go to Boston by himself.
6431945	eng	I think Tom kissed Mary for the first time yesterday.
6431946	eng	I think Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
6431947	eng	I haven't decided whether to go college or get a job.
6431948	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what happened.
6431949	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up anytime soon.
6431950	eng	I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
6431951	eng	I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
6431952	eng	How much time did it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431953	eng	How much time did it take Tom to hang up the laundry?
6431954	eng	How much should I pay Tom to help me paint my garage?
6431955	eng	How much money do you think Tom will need to do that?
6431956	eng	How much money do you estimate it'll take to do that?
6431957	eng	How much did Tom get paid to babysit Mary's children?
6431958	eng	How long did it take Tom to convince Mary to help us?
6431959	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to be a French teacher?
6431960	eng	Are you sure it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?
6431961	eng	Apparently, Tom and Mary talked about that on Monday.
6431962	eng	"Is Mary your girlfriend?" "No, she's just a friend."
6431963	eng	You could've let me know you were going out tonight.
6431964	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's going on?
6431965	eng	Why don't you call Tom and invite him to your party?
6431966	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't live in Boston anymore?
6431967	eng	Who did Tom say was going to go to Boston with Mary?
6431968	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got jealous.
6431969	eng	When Tom got home, his children were already asleep.
6431970	eng	What do you think Tom will do now that he's retired?
6431971	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't need to.
6431972	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't have to.
6431973	eng	Tom works for a company that makes automobile parts.
6431974	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't eat her whole sandwich.
6431975	eng	Tom won't make you do anything you don't want to do.
6431976	eng	Tom won't be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431977	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to get any money for doing that.
6431978	eng	Tom was walking too fast for Mary catch up with him.
6431979	eng	Tom was supposed to babysit our children last night.
6431980	eng	Tom was afraid that he was about to lose everything.
6431981	eng	Tom wanted to practice French with a native speaker.
6431982	eng	Tom thought the boy he saw talking to Mary was John.
6431983	eng	Tom thought Mary was going to let him go home early.
6431984	eng	Tom thought Mary lied to him about where she'd been.
6431985	eng	Tom thinks that Mary will eat what he makes for her.
6431986	eng	Tom stole something from the store where Mary works.
6431987	eng	Tom says it doesn't matter to him if Mary does that.
6431988	eng	Tom says he needs the rest of the money you owe him.
6431989	eng	Tom says he has to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431990	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let John drive.
6431991	eng	Tom says he and his wife haven't yet discussed that.
6431992	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary was in love with John.
6431993	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she ought to do.
6431994	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still in her office.
6431995	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be hesitant to do that.
6431996	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be having a lot of fun.
6431997	eng	Tom said that Mary said she was hoping we'd do that.
6431998	eng	Tom said that Mary said she didn't care what we did.
6431999	eng	Tom said it was Mary who ate the last piece of cake.
6432000	eng	Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
6432001	eng	Tom said he thought that Mary had already done that.
6432002	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't forget to do that.
6432003	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that.
6432004	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was still living in Boston.
6432005	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was going to do that today.

6432007	eng	Tom said he thought I might be permitted to do that.
6432008	eng	Tom promised Mary that he'd eat whatever she cooked.
6432009	eng	Tom loved living on the ranch with his grandparents.
6432010	eng	Tom lived in Australia when he was younger, I think.
6432011	eng	Tom listened carefully, but he didn't hear anything.
6432012	eng	Tom knew that the package on the desk was from Mary.
6432013	eng	Tom just got a job working for an insurance company.
6432014	eng	Tom isn't as determined to do that as he used to be.
6432015	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that.
6432016	eng	Tom is probably going to know what needs to be done.
6432017	eng	Tom is probably going to go swimming this afternoon.
6432018	eng	Tom is probably going to be tired when he gets home.
6432019	eng	Tom is probably going to be the next one to do that.

6432021	eng	Tom is never going to tell you what really happened.
6432022	eng	Tom is never going to be able to keep this a secret.
6432023	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that by himself.

6432040	eng	Tom gave each of his children three hundred dollars.
6432041	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary should eat so much junk food.
6432042	eng	Tom could hear what was being said in the next room.
6432043	eng	Tom can't do that alone. Mary will have to help him.
6432044	eng	Tom called to say wouldn't be back until after 2:30.
6432045	eng	Tom called to say he wouldn't be back till tomorrow.
6432046	eng	Tom asked us if we'd like to go to Boston with Mary.

6432048	eng	Tom and Mary spent the evening watching TV together.
6432049	eng	Tom and Mary ended up getting married to each other.
6432050	eng	Tom and Mary are sitting under that tree over there.
6432051	eng	There are lots of people who could help you do that.
6432052	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been accused of doing that.
6432053	eng	My parents wouldn't let me drive until I was twenty.
6432054	eng	Mary's husband was here a while ago looking for her.
6432055	eng	Mary is a nice girl, except that she talks too much.
6432056	eng	It's going to take me a good three hours to do that.
6432057	eng	It seems like I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6432058	eng	It seems like I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6432059	eng	It looks like I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6432060	eng	It looks like I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6432061	eng	I'd be very surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6432062	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what needs to be done.
6432063	eng	I wonder if Tom really wants us to do that for Mary.
6432064	eng	I wish you hadn't lied to me about where you'd been.
6432065	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to drive.
6432066	eng	I understand French, but I can't speak it very well.
6432067	eng	I thought Tom would apologize to Mary, but he didn't.
6432068	eng	I thought Tom knew why we couldn't do that for Mary.
6432069	eng	I think you should tell Tom why you don't like Mary.
6432070	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom play with Mary anymore.
6432071	eng	I think that Tom lied to you about when he did that.
6432072	eng	I think Tom will do the same thing he did yesterday.
6432073	eng	I still drive that old truck my grandfather gave me.
6432074	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure that I love him.
6432075	eng	I know Tom is in the hospital, but I don't know why.
6432076	eng	I interviewed Tom Jackson on October 20th in Boston.
6432077	eng	I don't think Tom likes you as much as you like him.
6432078	eng	I don't think Tom likes doing this as much as we do.
6432079	eng	How much money do you spend on groceries every week?
6432080	eng	How many weeks do you think Tom will stay in Boston?
6432081	eng	How many days did it take you to paint that picture?
6432082	eng	How many days did it take Tom to paint this picture?
6432083	eng	Go wake Tom up and tell him that breakfast is ready.
6432084	eng	You promised me you'd look after the kids tomorrow.
6432085	eng	You could've let me know you were going to be late.
6432086	eng	Who did Tom think would want to go there with Mary?
6432087	eng	We won't be able to do that if Tom doesn't help us.
6432088	eng	We need to find out where Tom wants us to meet him.
6432089	eng	We need to buy another file cabinet for the office.
6432090	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me who gave him those binoculars.
6432091	eng	Tom wouldn't let his children speak French at home.
6432092	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary do anything she wanted to do.

6432101	eng	Tom told me he walked through the woods by himself.
6432102	eng	Tom told Mary he'd be ready to go in three minutes.
6432103	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted to eat meatloaf for supper.
6432104	eng	Tom told Mary he couldn't eat lunch with her today.
6432105	eng	Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to help him.
6432106	eng	Tom stopped at a store on the way home to buy beer.
6432107	eng	Tom seems to have lost interest in studying French.
6432108	eng	Tom says he's deleted Mary's number from his phone.
6432109	eng	Tom says he saw Mary eating a sandwich in the park.
6432110	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he's very good at French.
6432111	eng	Tom says he doesn't think Mary would let him drive.
6432112	eng	Tom said that he was very worried about his future.
6432113	eng	Tom said that he was very sorry for what he'd done.
6432114	eng	Tom said that he was very interested in doing that.
6432115	eng	Tom said that he was very glad Mary didn't do that.

6432121	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be able to do that.
6432122	eng	Tom said that Mary will fly to Australia next week.
6432123	eng	Tom said that Mary was difficult to get along with.
6432124	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be having a good time.
6432125	eng	Tom said that Mary seemed to be enjoying the party.
6432126	eng	Tom said that Mary said she wasn't sure what to do.
6432127	eng	Tom said that Mary said she wanted John to do that.
6432128	eng	Tom said that Mary has always lived on Park Street.
6432129	eng	Tom said he was hoping you could do that with Mary.
6432130	eng	Tom said he thought he might need to do that today.
6432131	eng	Tom said he thought he might have to do that today.
6432132	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be too busy to help.
6432133	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be ready to do that.

6432140	eng	Tom said he saw Mary eating a sandwich in the park.
6432141	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would let John drive.
6432142	eng	Tom said Mary was unlikely to eat anything he made.
6432143	eng	Tom said Mary might not eat dinner with us tonight.
6432144	eng	Tom promised Mary he'd eat everything on his plate.
6432145	eng	Tom probably doesn't know who's going to help Mary.
6432146	eng	Tom overheard what was being said in the next room.
6432147	eng	Tom needs to stay in bed if he wants to recuperate.
6432148	eng	Tom might've lied about who he went to Boston with.
6432149	eng	Tom looked around the room, but he didn't see Mary.
6432150	eng	Tom let the air out of all the tires on Mary's car.
6432151	eng	Tom knows you didn't eat the cake he baked for you.
6432152	eng	Tom knows Mary will probably be busy all afternoon.
6432153	eng	Tom isn't willing to do that unless Mary helps him.
6432154	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't need to do that.
6432155	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't have to do that.
6432156	eng	Tom isn't as motivated to do that as he used to be.
6432157	eng	Tom isn't as desperate to do that as he used to be.
6432158	eng	Tom is worried that something might happen to Mary.
6432159	eng	Tom is the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6432160	eng	Tom is probably going to get fined if he does that.
6432161	eng	Tom is probably going to figure out how to do that.
6432162	eng	Tom is never going to permit Mary to do that again.
6432163	eng	Tom is never going to find out about what happened.
6432164	eng	Tom is likely going to be very hesitant to do that.

6432166	eng	Tom is likely going to be hungry when he gets home.
6432167	eng	Tom is going to stay with us for a couple of weeks.
6432168	eng	Tom is going to miss the train if he doesn't hurry.

6432181	eng	Tom has to finish doing that before he can go home.
6432182	eng	Tom has finally found something he's good at doing.

6432185	eng	Tom has been Mary's French teacher for three years.
6432186	eng	Tom doesn't want to do that, but he says he has to.
6432187	eng	Tom doesn't have to worry about anything right now.
6432188	eng	Tom didn't eat the sandwich that Mary made for him.
6432189	eng	Tom and Mary's wedding anniversary is October 20th.
6432190	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other for three years.
6432191	eng	Tom and I haven't kissed each other in a long time.
6432192	eng	The restaurant we went to yesterday was quite good.
6432193	eng	The only thing Tom ever gave me was his old jacket.
6432194	eng	Someone who knows French well must've written this.
6432195	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends in Boston.
6432196	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I need to do that.
6432197	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I have to do that.
6432198	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has gotten used to doing that.
6432199	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been able to do that.
6432200	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever attempted to do that.
6432201	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has asked me to do that again.
6432202	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has apologized for doing that.
6432203	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has agreed to help us do that.
6432204	eng	My parents are the ones who taught me how to drive.
6432205	eng	Mary said she wouldn't do that unless you help her.
6432206	eng	Mary said she wouldn't do that unless I helped her.
6432207	eng	Mary said she didn't know who Tom's girlfriend was.
6432208	eng	Mary refused to accept the roses that Tom sent her.
6432209	eng	Mary knew she wasn't the first girl Tom had kissed.
6432210	eng	Mary is depressed because her husband has left her.
6432211	eng	It's probably going to probably be easy to do that.
6432212	eng	It's probably going to be tough for you to do that.
6432213	eng	It's probably going to be tough for Tom to do that.
6432214	eng	It's probably going to be risky for you to do that.
6432215	eng	It's probably going to be risky for Tom to do that.
6432216	eng	It's probably going to be cheap for you to do that.
6432217	eng	It's going to take three hours to make the changes.
6432218	eng	It's going to take me about three hours to do that.
6432219	eng	It's going to be dark by the time we get to Boston.
6432220	eng	It looks like Tom has fallen down and hurt himself.
6432221	eng	It doesn't matter to me whether you do that or not.
6432222	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you've done for Mary.
6432223	eng	I'd be grateful to you if you could teach me to drive.
6432224	eng	I would've let Tom drive if I'd known he wanted to.
6432225	eng	I wonder why Tom lied to us about when he did that.
6432226	eng	I wish I could do that with you today, but I can't.
6432227	eng	I thought Tom was going to buy some blankets today.
6432228	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he wants.
6432229	eng	I ran into some of my friends at the train station.
6432230	eng	I hope you haven't forgotten about today's meeting.
6432231	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what we did.
6432232	eng	I don't think these are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6432233	eng	I didn't think it was a good idea to let Tom drive.
6432234	eng	How much money do you think you'll need to do that?
6432235	eng	How many hours do you think it took Tom to do that?
6432236	eng	Even though it was raining, we went out for a walk.
6432237	eng	Almost all of Tom's ex-wives are friends with Mary.
6432238	eng	You said Tom wouldn't kiss me, but you were wrong.
6432239	eng	You haven't forgotten about the meeting, have you?
6432240	eng	Would you like to go and see a movie this evening?
6432241	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got angry.
6432242	eng	Tom would've been here if he knew he needed to be.
6432243	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in the lobby at 2:30.

6432569	eng	Even though you said I should kiss Tom, I didn't.
6432570	eng	Did Tom say why the police were looking for Mary?
6432571	eng	You shouldn't have tried doing that by yourself.
6432572	eng	You haven't forgotten to pay the rent, have you?
6432573	eng	You don't have to help Tom if you don't want to.
6432574	eng	Would you like me to pick you up at the airport?
6432575	eng	Why don't you like to speak in French in public?
6432576	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you can't drive?
6432577	eng	Why don't you just tell Tom you don't like Mary?
6432578	eng	Why don't you get Tom to teach you how to drive?
6432579	eng	Who did Tom think was going to do that for Mary?
6432580	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom kissing Mary?
6432581	eng	What do you and Tom want to do tomorrow morning?
6432582	eng	We've only got three days left to get this done.

6432585	eng	Tom's oldest daughter looks a lot like his wife.
6432586	eng	Tom's parents have decided to get divorced.
6432587	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me where he'd put my car keys.

6432665	eng	Tom is wearing the shirt that Mary made for him.

6432729	eng	Please make sure you have enough money with you.

6432731	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has volunteered to do that.
6432732	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has the ability to do that.
6432733	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever wanted to do that.
6432734	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has enough time to do that.
6432735	eng	Monday would have been Tom's thirtieth birthday.

6432737	eng	Mary told Tom she'd never eat any wild mushroom.
6432738	eng	Mary told Tom she intended to eat lunch at home.

6432769	eng	Mary hugged Tom and told him that she loved him.
6432770	eng	Mary hopes that Tom will teach her how to drive.
6432771	eng	Mary asked Tom if she could eat the last cookie.
6432772	eng	It's probably going to be impossible to do that.
6432773	eng	It's probably going to be depressing to do that.
6432774	eng	It's not too late to ask Tom to do that for you.
6432775	eng	It's going to take time to get everything ready.
6432776	eng	It's going to take less than an hour to do that.
6432777	eng	It's going to take all afternoon and maybe more.
6432778	eng	It's going to happen, but just not anytime soon.
6432779	eng	It's going to be some time before Tom gets here.
6432780	eng	It started to rain as soon as we started eating.
6432781	eng	I've finished reading all the books you lent me.
6432782	eng	I've been waiting for you to tell me what to do.
6432783	eng	I'm telling you this because I'm your friend.

6432785	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
6432786	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
6432787	eng	I'm going to visit Tom in the hospital tomorrow.
6432788	eng	I told Tom that I wanted to live on Park Street.
6432789	eng	I thought Tom would love the gift Mary gave him.
6432790	eng	I thought Tom would like the gift Mary gave him.
6432791	eng	I thought Mary would love the gift Tom gave her.
6432792	eng	I thought Mary would like the gift Tom gave her.
6432793	eng	I thought Mary said she didn't have a boyfriend.
6432794	eng	I think your baby is crying because he's hungry.
6432795	eng	I think you should try to persuade Tom to drive.
6432796	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that by himself.
6432797	eng	I think we can all agree that that's a bad idea.
6432798	eng	I think Tom would like Mary to do that for John.
6432799	eng	I think Tom should tell Mary to leave him alone.
6432800	eng	I think Tom knows why we can't do that for Mary.

6432805	eng	I hope Tom and Mary don't eat all the ice cream.
6432806	eng	I don't want to answer any more questions today.
6432807	eng	I don't think Mary would ever leave her husband.
6432808	eng	I don't know if Tom will be home this afternoon.
6432809	eng	I don't have time for a cup of coffee right now.
6432810	eng	How often does Tom wear that scarf you gave him?
6432811	eng	How much wine do you think Tom drinks every day?
6432812	eng	How much time do you spend on the bus every day?

6432822	eng	Even though you said I should do that, I didn't.
6432823	eng	Even though Tom said I shouldn't do that, I did.
6432824	eng	Even though Tom said I should do that, I didn't.
6432825	eng	Don't you remember what Tom did to us last year?
6432826	eng	Do you really think this water is safe to drink?
6432827	eng	Do you kiss your children goodbye every morning?
6432828	eng	Do you have anything planned for this afternoon?
6432829	eng	Did Tom say why the police are looking for Mary?
6432830	eng	Did Tom actually see Mary eat your piece of pie?
6432831	eng	Am I the only one worried that Tom will be late?
6432832	eng	About how many pictures does Tom take every day?
6432833	eng	You won't believe what happened this afternoon.
6432834	eng	You should've lied to Tom about where you were.
6432835	eng	You should've let me drive you home last night.
6432836	eng	You should tell Tom why you disagree with Mary.
6432837	eng	You should let Tom know that you want to drive.
6432838	eng	You ought to let Tom know that you can't drive.
6432839	eng	You didn't sell any of your paintings, did you?
6432840	eng	Wouldn't it be better not to do that right now?
6432841	eng	Why don't you just tell Tom you don't like him?
6432842	eng	Why didn't you do what you were supposed to do?
6432843	eng	When do you think Tom will want us to help him?
6432844	eng	Tom, Mary and John all went to the same school.
6432845	eng	Tom's oldest daughter looks just like his wife.
6432846	eng	Tom's keys are somewhere in this room, I think.

6433044	eng	It's going to take me several hours to do that.
6433045	eng	It's going to cause me problems if you do that.
6433046	eng	It's going to be easier if we do that together.
6433047	eng	It's going to be done by the time you get here.
6433048	eng	It's been years since I've been back to Boston.

6433054	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6433055	eng	I would strongly advise you to stop doing that.
6433056	eng	I was born in Boston, but I grew up in Chicago.
6433057	eng	I think the whole thing was a misunderstanding.

6433066	eng	I still have the same questions I asked before.
6433067	eng	I have visited Tom a number of times in Boston.
6433068	eng	I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
6433069	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that.
6433070	eng	I don't have many friends who can speak French.
6433071	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive.
6433072	eng	I can show you around town if you'd like me to.

6433087	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you help Mary?
6433088	eng	Could what happened in Boston also happen here?
6433089	eng	As far as I know, Tom has never studied French.
6433090	eng	As far as I know, Tom has never been to Boston.
6433091	eng	Aren't you the one who taught Tom how to drive?
6433092	eng	Are you sure that Tom was the one who did that?
6433093	eng	A girl named Mary said she was looking for you.
6433094	eng	Your French isn't good enough to get that job.
6433095	eng	You'd really better stop doing that right now.
6433096	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about what we did.
6433097	eng	Wouldn't it be better for us to do that today?
6433098	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom doing that?
6433099	eng	When was the last time Tom ate lunch with you?
6433100	eng	When do you think Tom will want us to do that?
6433101	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he smiled.
6433102	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a teenager.
6433103	eng	What's the best way to get downtown from here?
6433104	eng	What time do you usually get home from school?
6433105	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to donate money?
6433106	eng	Tom wouldn't let anybody do anything for Mary.
6433107	eng	Tom won't find anyone who'll do that for Mary.
6433108	eng	Tom will try to talk to Mary about that today.
6433109	eng	Tom will show us the documents this afternoon.
6433110	eng	Tom will definitely not allow Mary to do that.

6433235	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is camping.
6433236	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has the right to do that.
6433237	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been told to do that.
6433238	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want to go with us.
6433239	eng	Mary's oldest son looks just like her husband.
6433240	eng	Mary's husband died three hours after she did.
6433241	eng	Mary's boyfriend is a lot younger than she is.
6433242	eng	Mary told Tom not to kiss her in public again.
6433243	eng	Mary told Tom about what John asked her to do.
6433244	eng	Mary thought Tom was going to do that for her.
6433245	eng	Mary never told us that Tom was her boyfriend.
6433246	eng	Mary dated Tom's brother before she dated him.
6433247	eng	Mary asked Tom to pretend to be her boyfriend.
6433248	eng	It's probably going to be easy for Tom to win.
6433249	eng	It's going to take Tom a long time to do that.
6433250	eng	It's going to be almost impossible to do that.
6433251	eng	It's been three weeks since Tom has been here.
6433252	eng	It's a good thing that you did that yesterday.
6433253	eng	It's a good thing that Tom did that yesterday.
6433254	eng	It'll take us at least three hours to do that.

6433261	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you do for Mary.
6433262	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for him.
6433263	eng	I'm not going to let Tom drive my car anymore.
6433264	eng	I'm glad you're coming to visit us next month.
6433265	eng	I'm fairly certain that's not going to happen.
6433266	eng	I wouldn't have let Tom drive if I'd been you.
6433267	eng	I wouldn't be able to do that even if I tried.
6433268	eng	I wonder what Tom will do with all that money.
6433269	eng	I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
6433270	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to come here tomorrow.
6433271	eng	I thought you said you wouldn't let Tom drive.
6433272	eng	I think you need to stop doing that right now.
6433273	eng	I think Tom knows he needs to help Mary today.
6433274	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to get here earlier.
6433275	eng	I still wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6433276	eng	I often recommend your website to my students.
6433277	eng	I never even got to tell Tom that I loved him.
6433278	eng	I hope Tom doesn't think we've forgotten Mary.

6433284	eng	I didn't know you were going to let Tom drive.
6433285	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to let Mary drive.

6433293	eng	Don't think that I'm going to let you do that.
6433294	eng	Don't put your books on the dining room table.
6433295	eng	Don't forget that you need to buy some onions.
6433296	eng	Do you think we should take umbrellas with us?
6433297	eng	Do you really think Tom will be here tomorrow?
6433298	eng	All the boys in Mary's class think she's cute.
6433299	eng	You should let Tom know that you can't drive.
6433300	eng	You should let Tom know that Mary will drive.
6433301	eng	You should get Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433302	eng	You should ask Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433303	eng	You don't really need to lose weight, do you?
6433304	eng	You don't know when Tom will do that, do you?
6433305	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't do that anymore?
6433306	eng	Why are you glad that that's going to happen?
6433307	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a student.
6433308	eng	What Tom wanted was to another piece of cake.
6433309	eng	We didn't know whether Tom was dead or alive.

6433510	eng	I don't hug my children as often as I should.
6433511	eng	I convinced Tom to lie about where he'd been.
6433512	eng	I can show you around town if you want me to.
6433513	eng	I bought these flowers for Mary, not for you.
6433514	eng	How many times a day do you check your email?

6433527	eng	Did Tom actually see Mary eating my sandwich?
6433528	eng	Could what happened to Tom also happen to us?
6433529	eng	Ask Tom if Mary will eat lunch with us today.
6433530	eng	Are you sure you don't mind me tagging along?
6433531	eng	Are you going to tell Tom that you love Mary?
6433532	eng	Would you like me to teach you how to drive?
6433533	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom was born?
6433534	eng	Why is Tom glad that that's going to happen?
6433535	eng	What have you accomplished so far this week?
6433536	eng	What I'd really like is a hot cup of coffee.
6433537	eng	We're getting the results that we hoped for.

6434024	eng	The doctor says that Tom will be all right.
6434025	eng	The children want you to read them a story.

6434059	eng	It's probably going to be raining tomorrow.
6434060	eng	It's probably going to be cheap to do that.
6434061	eng	It's just going to take a few more minutes.
6434062	eng	It's going to take us hours to finish this.
6434063	eng	It's going to stop snowing sooner or later.
6434064	eng	It's going to cost you more to go by plane.
6434065	eng	It's going to cost at least thirty dollars.
6434066	eng	It's been a while since I've talked to Tom.
6434067	eng	It might be a good idea to stop doing that.
6434068	eng	Is Tom the one who taught you how to drive?
6434069	eng	I've finished reading the book you lent me.
6434070	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434071	eng	I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
6434072	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't be interested.
6434073	eng	I'm going to buy myself a birthday present.
6434074	eng	I'm absolutely positive that I can do that.
6434075	eng	I'd rather not kiss Tom if I don't have to.
6434076	eng	I wonder if that'll happen in our lifetimes.
6434077	eng	I wish you'd stop lying to us all the time.
6434078	eng	I wish I could help you today, but I can't.
6434079	eng	I wanted to drive, but Tom wouldn't let me.
6434080	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom works.
6434081	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom lives.
6434082	eng	I want to know if Tom knows how to do that.
6434083	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he wouldn't let me.
6434084	eng	I told Tom he could buy whatever he wanted.
6434085	eng	I told Tom he could buy anything he wanted.
6434086	eng	I thought I saw Tom kissing Mary yesterday.
6434087	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom drive anymore.
6434088	eng	I think we all know that that's a bad idea.
6434089	eng	I think Tom won't stop crying anytime soon.
6434090	eng	I think Tom said that Mary was from Boston.
6434091	eng	I think Tom said he needed to buy a shovel.
6434092	eng	I spend a lot of time doing things for Tom.
6434093	eng	I sang in the church choir for three years.
6434094	eng	I intend to lie to Tom about what happened.
6434095	eng	I don't think you should be doing that now.
6434096	eng	I don't think this is exactly what we need.
6434097	eng	I don't think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6434098	eng	I don't think Tom would ever do that again.
6434099	eng	I don't think Tom would be able to help us.
6434100	eng	I don't think Mary would leave her husband.
6434101	eng	I didn't let Tom talk me into helping Mary.
6434102	eng	I didn't allow Tom do what he wanted to do.
6434103	eng	I did know that Tom used to live in Boston.
6434104	eng	How much sugar should I put in your coffee?
6434105	eng	How much more work do you have to do today?
6434106	eng	How much more weight does Tom want to lose?
6434107	eng	How much do you think I could make busking?
6434108	eng	How much coffee did you drink this morning?
6434109	eng	How many pounds do you think I should lose?
6434110	eng	How long did it take you to read that book?
6434111	eng	How long did it take Tom to get here today?
6434112	eng	How did Tom get Mary to eat her vegetables?
6434113	eng	Eventually Tom purchased a house in Boston.
6434114	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you drive?
6434115	eng	Could you please be quiet? Tom is sleeping.
6434116	eng	Are you still working for the same company?
6434117	eng	Are you going to take an umbrella with you?
6434118	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "In the garden."
6434119	eng	You should've asked me to do that for you.
6434120	eng	You said Tom wouldn't kiss me, but he did.
6434121	eng	Would you happen to know why Tom was late?
6434122	eng	Where do you think Tom will go to college?
6434123	eng	When was the last time Tom came to Boston?
6434124	eng	When and where did you and Tom first kiss?
6434125	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to help you?
6434126	eng	We still don't know what Tom will do next.
6434127	eng	We shouldn't tell Tom about what happened.
6434128	eng	Tom's family lived in Boston at that time.
6434129	eng	Tom wouldn't likely go camping by himself.
6434130	eng	Tom wouldn't let you go there by yourself.
6434131	eng	Tom works for a company that sells bricks.
6434132	eng	Tom won't be very happy if Mary does that.

6434139	eng	Tom will hurt himself if he's not careful.
6434140	eng	Tom will go to the beach with us tomorrow.
6434141	eng	Tom will be very uncomfortable doing that.
6434142	eng	Tom will be really disappointed, won't he?
6434143	eng	Tom will be eating dinner with us tonight.

6434155	eng	Tom was expecting a little more than that.
6434156	eng	Tom was afraid people might laugh at Mary.
6434157	eng	Tom wants me to go to the dance with Mary.

6434328	eng	Tom has a tattoo of an eagle on his chest.
6434329	eng	Tom found the necklace that Mary had lost.
6434330	eng	Tom fell in love with one of his students.
6434331	eng	Tom fell down the stairs and hurt himself.

6434340	eng	Tom didn't know what was likely to happen?
6434341	eng	Tom didn't have time to go shopping today.
6434342	eng	Tom didn't get home until late last night.
6434343	eng	Tom didn't expect you to do that for Mary.
6434344	eng	Tom couldn't find his way out of the cave.
6434345	eng	Tom couldn't come today because he's sick.
6434346	eng	Tom could probably teach you how to drive.
6434347	eng	Tom convinced Mary to make him a sandwich.
6434348	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach John how to drive.
6434349	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the park with him.
6434350	eng	Tom and Mary sat side by side on the sofa.
6434351	eng	Tom and Mary hung up the laundry together.
6434352	eng	Tom and Mary don't hug each other anymore.
6434353	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John three years ago.
6434354	eng	Tom and I'll hang up the laundry together.
6434355	eng	Tom agreed to meet with Mary in the lobby.
6434356	eng	They knocked thirty dollars off the price.
6434357	eng	There's nothing I like more than swimming.
6434358	eng	There's not much chance of that happening.
6434359	eng	There's a jewelry store not far from here.
6434360	eng	There was nothing we could do to help Tom.
6434361	eng	The book I bought yesterday was expensive.
6434362	eng	Personally, I think you shouldn't do that.
6434363	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that today.
6434364	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that again.
6434365	eng	Mary's husband told me she wasn't at home.
6434366	eng	Mary will do anything she can to help Tom.
6434367	eng	Mary wasn't a popular girl in high school.
6434368	eng	Mary told Tom she wanted something to eat.
6434369	eng	Mary talked to Tom about that, didn't she?
6434370	eng	Mary showed us a picture of her boyfriend.

6434374	eng	Mary looks almost identical to her sister.
6434375	eng	Mary didn't tell me Tom was her boyfriend.
6434376	eng	Mary bought herself a dress for the party.
6434377	eng	Many of Tom's friends think he's a genius.
6434378	eng	It's unlikely that Tom will be here today.
6434379	eng	It's time for the kids to go to bed.
6434380	eng	It's probably going to be safe to do that.
6434381	eng	It's going to take longer than you expect.
6434382	eng	It's going to take a long time to do that.
6434383	eng	It's going to be sunny tomorrow afternoon.
6434384	eng	It's going to be crowded everywhere today.
6434385	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't do that.
6434386	eng	It seems Tom is having trouble doing that.
6434387	eng	It looks like Tom hasn't shaved in a week.
6434388	eng	I've been studying French for three hours.
6434389	eng	I'm sure that Tom won't help Mary do that.
6434390	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if we did that.
6434391	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach you how to drive.
6434392	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will be there tonight.
6434393	eng	I'm going to give all my possessions away.
6434394	eng	I'll tell Tom you're not going to do that.
6434395	eng	I'd rather not do that if I don't have to.
6434396	eng	I'd like to stay here for three more days.
6434397	eng	I wonder if Tom's friends would help Mary.
6434398	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that on Monday.
6434399	eng	I wonder how much Tom got paid to do that.
6434400	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to Mary about that.
6434401	eng	I wish I could do that today, but I can't.
6434402	eng	I was the one who taught Tom how to drive.
6434403	eng	I want to know if you know how to do that.
6434404	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he pushed me away.
6434405	eng	I think that's going to happen quite soon.
6434406	eng	I think Tom should do that somewhere else.
6434407	eng	I think Tom didn't do what he said he did.
6434408	eng	I think Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434409	eng	I think I'll never get used to doing this.
6434410	eng	I suppose I really ought to do that today.
6434411	eng	I really don't like the way Tom does that.
6434412	eng	I never listen to classical music anymore.
6434413	eng	I have a few friends who can speak French.
6434414	eng	I had to drive home because Tom was drunk.
6434415	eng	I find it hard to understand Tom's French.
6434416	eng	I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
6434417	eng	I don't think you should do that with Tom.
6434418	eng	I don't think Tom will be here until 2:30.
6434419	eng	I don't think Tom is obligated to do that.
6434420	eng	I don't really like the way Tom does that.
6434421	eng	I don't always kiss my children goodnight.
6434422	eng	I can't remember what happened after that.
6434423	eng	How much time will it take you to do that?
6434424	eng	How much time will it take Tom to do that?
6434425	eng	How much money do you usually have on you?
6434426	eng	How many times a month does Tom come here?
6434427	eng	How many sandwiches did Tom make for Mary?
6434428	eng	How long have you spent doing that so far?

6434430	eng	How do you think Tom will propose to Mary?
6434431	eng	How did you find out that Tom kissed Mary?
6434432	eng	How did Tom know we were looking for Mary?
6434433	eng	Have you told Tom why you don't like Mary?
6434434	eng	Don't mothers kiss their children anymore?
6434436	eng	Do you think Tom will come to pick you up?
6434437	eng	Do you think Tom is ever going to do that?
6434438	eng	Do you still feel like eating out tonight?
6434439	eng	Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
6434440	eng	Did Tom tell Mary why he ate her sandwich?
6434441	eng	Did Tom ask you to go to Boston with Mary?
6434442	eng	Did Tom ask Mary why she ate his sandwich?
6434443	eng	Could you tell me where I can park my car?
6434444	eng	Can you help me clean up before you leave?
6434445	eng	Are you sure that Tom is Mary's boyfriend?
6434446	eng	About thirty people were severely injured.
6434447	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "On the cheek."
6434448	eng	You're just the person I was looking for.
6434449	eng	You don't speak French very well, do you?
6434450	eng	Would you like me to unwrap that for you?
6434451	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom lives?
6434452	eng	Would it be all right if I let Tom drive?
6434453	eng	Would Tom care if Mary ate lunch with me?
6434454	eng	With friends like Tom, who needs enemies?
6434455	eng	Why isn't Tom hanging up the laundry now?
6434456	eng	Why don't you want to go to school today?
6434457	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't like Boston?
6434458	eng	Why do you let Tom to treat you that way?

6434471	eng	What do you think Tom's favorite food is?
6434472	eng	What Tom wanted was some peace and quiet.
6434473	eng	We don't know what caused that to happen.
6434474	eng	Tom's wife died three hours after he did.
6434475	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary sing with his band.
6434476	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that now, would he?

6435072	eng	It's probably not going to happen today.
6435073	eng	It's going to take some time to do that.
6435074	eng	It's going to take at least three hours.

6435088	eng	I'm not going to teach you how to drive.
6435089	eng	I'd rather not to lie to Tom about that.
6435090	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom let you do that.
6435091	eng	I wouldn't want to do that for a living.
6435092	eng	I wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6435093	eng	I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
6435094	eng	I wonder if you could help me with this.
6435095	eng	I wish I'd never lied to Tom about that.
6435096	eng	I want to know if you know who did that.
6435097	eng	I told Tom the same thing you told Mary.
6435098	eng	I told Tom the same thing Mary told him.
6435099	eng	I think Tom will propose to you tonight.
6435100	eng	I think Tom understood your explanation.
6435101	eng	I think Tom should tell Mary to do that.
6435102	eng	I suggest you stop doing that right now.
6435103	eng	I still wonder why Tom let Mary do that.
6435104	eng	I should've brought my umbrella with me.

6435106	eng	I know that Tom expects me to help Mary.
6435107	eng	I know Tom and Mary want to get married.

6435110	eng	I hope Tom does what we asked him to do.
6435111	eng	I have visited Tom many times in Boston.
6435112	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up.
6435113	eng	I don't think Tom would ever forget you.
6435114	eng	I don't think Tom will be too much help.
6435115	eng	I don't think Tom was telling the truth.
6435116	eng	I don't really like punk rock very much.

6435135	eng	Her name is Mary and she's Tom's sister.

6435139	eng	Do you really think it'll snow tomorrow?

6435141	eng	Did you bring what I asked you to bring?
6435142	eng	Did Tom really think we would help Mary?
6435143	eng	Could you tell me what needs to be done?
6435144	eng	Can you tell me where I should put this?
6435145	eng	Are you sure that Tom really likes Mary?
6435146	eng	Are you sure that Tom doesn't like Mary?
6435147	eng	Are you still working at the same place?
6435148	eng	You'd better stop doing that right now.
6435149	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about that.
6435150	eng	You shouldn't have been so mean to Tom.
6435151	eng	You should tell Tom that you love Mary.
6435152	eng	Would you like me to unwrap it for you?
6435153	eng	Why don't you help Tom paint the fence?
6435154	eng	Why do you think Tom shouldn't do that?
6435155	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't trust you?

6435683	eng	Tom has been an optimist all his life.
6435684	eng	Tom has been a pessimist all his life.
6435685	eng	Tom has already complained about that.
6435686	eng	Tom has already asked Mary to do that.
6435687	eng	Tom forgot his umbrella in Mary's car.
6435688	eng	Tom doesn't need to come to my office.
6435689	eng	Tom doesn't like to talk to strangers.
6435690	eng	Tom doesn't like the way Mary dresses.
6435691	eng	Tom does tend to be stubborn at times.
6435692	eng	Tom died three years ago of pneumonia.
6435693	eng	Tom didn't want to talk to the police.
6435694	eng	Tom didn't want to spend time in jail.
6435695	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would leave him.
6435696	eng	Tom didn't tell the police everything.
6435697	eng	Tom didn't know Mary was still asleep.
6435698	eng	Tom didn't hear Mary yelling for help.
6435699	eng	Tom didn't eat the apple you gave him.
6435700	eng	Tom can't let Mary do that by herself.
6435701	eng	Tom ate the cookies Mary made for him.
6435702	eng	Tom asked Mary not to hug him anymore.
6435703	eng	Tom and Mary will eat with us tonight.
6435704	eng	Tom and Mary were both very concerned.
6435705	eng	Tom and Mary spent Christmas together.
6435706	eng	Tom and Mary ended up getting married.
6435707	eng	Tom and Mary ended up falling in love.
6435708	eng	Tom and Mary are swimming in the pool.
6435709	eng	Tom and I never walk anywhere anymore.
6435710	eng	This is my third time to visit Boston.
6435711	eng	The people were very unfriendly there.
6435712	eng	That movie was better than I expected.
6435713	eng	Tell Tom you're too busy to help Mary.
6435714	eng	Someday, I'm going to have to do that.
6435715	eng	Please make sure you get here on time.
6435716	eng	One day, I'm going to have to do that.
6435717	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been injured.
6435718	eng	My advice would be to stop doing that.
6435719	eng	Mary said she knew who Tom's wife was.
6435720	eng	Mary said she didn't have a boyfriend.
6435721	eng	It's very fortunate that Tom was here.
6435722	eng	It's only going to take three minutes.
6435723	eng	It's only going to take a few minutes.
6435724	eng	It's going to take forever to do that.
6435725	eng	It's going to cost you thirty dollars.
6435726	eng	It's going to be expensive to do that.
6435727	eng	It's going to be dangerous to do that.
6435728	eng	It won't take us very long to do that.
6435729	eng	It won't take us much time to do that.
6435730	eng	It won't take me very long to do that.
6435731	eng	It won't take me much time to do that.
6435732	eng	It was Tom who wanted to do that here.
6435733	eng	It looks like Tom will be early today.
6435734	eng	It could be years before that happens.
6435735	eng	Is there an elevator in this building?
6435736	eng	Is it absolutely necessary to do that?
6435737	eng	I've been looking for a place to live.
6435738	eng	I've asked Tom to hang up the laundry.
6435739	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind doing that.
6435740	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom will be late.
6435741	eng	I'm going to pick Tom up after school.
6435742	eng	I'm fairly certain that didn't happen.
6435743	eng	I'll tell Tom you're looking for Mary.
6435744	eng	I'll tell Tom you're going to do that.
6435745	eng	I'll never let Tom drive my car again.
6435746	eng	I'll never go shopping with Tom again.
6435747	eng	I'll ask Tom to teach me how to drive.
6435748	eng	I'd be very surprised if Tom did that.
6435749	eng	I wouldn't want to be a brain surgeon.
6435750	eng	I wonder if you could help me do that.
6435751	eng	I wonder if Tom lied to us about that.
6435752	eng	I wonder if Tom is still eating lunch.
6435753	eng	I wish you'd told me you were married.
6435754	eng	I wish Tom had told me he was married.
6435755	eng	I was hoping Tom would do that for us.
6435756	eng	I wanted Tom to teach me how to drive.
6435757	eng	I want to drive, but Tom won't let me.
6435758	eng	I think you should charge $30 an hour.
6435759	eng	I think we can all go in the same car.
6435760	eng	I think Tom will do something drastic.
6435761	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to kiss him.
6435762	eng	I think Tom doesn't understand French.
6435763	eng	I shouldn't have kissed Tom yesterday.
6435764	eng	I saw Tom at the station this morning.
6435765	eng	I never used to do that, but I do now.
6435766	eng	I know Tom will try to arrive on time.
6435767	eng	I knew Tom would lie to us about that.
6435768	eng	I hope we don't have to wait too long.
6435769	eng	I hope it doesn't rain this afternoon.
6435770	eng	I hope everything turns out all right.
6435771	eng	I hope Tom and Mary eat lunch with us.
6435772	eng	I hope I can go home for the holidays.
6435773	eng	I heard that you kissed Tom yesterday.
6435774	eng	I have many other things I want to do.
6435775	eng	I have many other things I need to do.
6435776	eng	I have many other things I have to do.
6435777	eng	I doubt that Tom will ever leave Mary.
6435778	eng	I don't think Tom will wait very long.
6435779	eng	I don't think Tom will stay very long.
6435780	eng	I don't know why Tom let Mary do that.
6435781	eng	I don't know where I left my umbrella.
6435782	eng	I don't know anything about computers.
6435783	eng	I didn't think Tom would let me drive.
6435784	eng	I can't remember Tom's brother's name.

6435795	eng	How many pounds did you actually lose?
6435796	eng	How many people do you know in Boston?
6435797	eng	How many days did you spend in Boston?
6435798	eng	Her name is Mary and she's Tom's wife.
6435799	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French?
6435800	eng	Give me some time to think about that.
6435801	eng	Does that mean that Tom won't do that?
6435802	eng	Does Tom know why you don't like Mary?
6435803	eng	Does Tom know how you feel about Mary?
6435804	eng	Do you know why Tom doesn't trust you?
6435805	eng	Did Tom say where we should meet Mary?
6435806	eng	Did Mary tell you about her boyfriend?
6435807	eng	Are you really going to let Tom drive?
6435808	eng	About thirty people have been injured.
6435809	eng	A lot of people I know live in Boston.
6435810	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about it.
6435811	eng	You should've let me do that for you.
6435812	eng	You know what Tom will do, don't you?
6435813	eng	Would you like me to wrap it for you?
6435814	eng	Why were you the last one to do that?
6435815	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't do that?

6435820	eng	Where do you think Tom will go today?
6435821	eng	When does Tom expect us to help Mary?
6435822	eng	Whatever you do, don't let Tom drive.
6435823	eng	We shouldn't kiss each other anymore.
6435824	eng	We know that Tom sometimes hits Mary.
6435825	eng	We know that Tom sometimes does that.
6435826	eng	We got the results that we hoped for.
6435827	eng	We can't predict what Tom will think.
6435828	eng	Tom's parents died when he was three.

6435837	eng	Tom will likely be able to fool Mary.
6435838	eng	Tom will have to do better than that.
6435839	eng	Tom will go to the concert with Mary.
6435840	eng	Tom will be very happy Mary did that.
6435841	eng	Tom will be mad at us for doing this.
6435842	eng	Tom will be late if he doesn't hurry.
6435843	eng	Tom will be happy to see that happen.
6435844	eng	Tom will ask Mary if she can do that.
6435845	eng	Tom wasn't the first man Mary kissed.
6435846	eng	Tom wasn't really excited about that.
6435847	eng	Tom wasn't expecting me to help Mary.
6435848	eng	Tom was waiting for Mary to call him.

6435866	eng	Tom thought Mary would never do that.
6435867	eng	Tom spent most of the day doing that.
6435868	eng	Tom spent all afternoon helping Mary.
6435869	eng	Tom sometimes feeds his cat dog food.
6435870	eng	Tom should've told me he was married.
6435871	eng	Tom should've been ready an hour ago.

6436044	eng	Let's keep this up as long as we can.
6436045	eng	It's quite unlikely Tom will do that.
6436046	eng	It's probably going to snow tomorrow.
6436047	eng	It's going to be dark in a few hours.
6436048	eng	It's going to be an interesting game.
6436049	eng	It's fine by me if you don't do that.
6436050	eng	It'll be difficult to find a job now.
6436051	eng	It won't be all that easy to do that.
6436052	eng	It was Tom who kissed Mary yesterday.
6436053	eng	It should be easy for Tom to do that.
6436054	eng	It is inevitable that that'll happen.
6436055	eng	It doesn't make any difference to me.
6436056	eng	I've quit drinking carbonated drinks.
6436057	eng	I've been waiting for you since 2:30.
6436058	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't need to do that.
6436059	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't have to do that.
6436060	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't do that.
6436061	eng	I'm fairly certain that won't happen.
6436062	eng	I'd rather stay home and read a book.
6436063	eng	I'd rather not lie to Tom anymore.
6436064	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed.
6436065	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.
6436066	eng	I wonder whether Tom would help Mary.
6436067	eng	I wish my parents would let me drive.
6436068	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to the police.
6436069	eng	I wish Tom had asked us to help Mary.
6436070	eng	I wish Tom had asked Mary to help us.
6436071	eng	I told Tom that I'd help him do that.
6436072	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that.
6436073	eng	I think this is exactly what we need.
6436074	eng	I think that it was Tom who did that.
6436075	eng	I think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6436076	eng	I think Tom's leg is much better now.
6436077	eng	I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
6436078	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to hug him.
6436079	eng	I think Tom doesn't enjoy doing that.
6436080	eng	I talked to my attorney this morning.
6436081	eng	I know the girl who's talking to Tom.
6436082	eng	I hope you didn't give Tom any money.
6436083	eng	I hope Tom and Mary do that together.
6436084	eng	I hear that you kissed Tom yesterday.
6436085	eng	I haven't seen a good movie recently.
6436086	eng	I don't want to think about that now.
6436087	eng	I don't want to go home empty-handed.
6436088	eng	I don't think you should do that now.
6436089	eng	I don't think Tom would let me drive.
6436090	eng	I don't think Tom will need our help.
6436091	eng	I don't think I should let you drive.
6436092	eng	I don't know where I left sunglasses.
6436093	eng	I don't know what I was so afraid of.
6436094	eng	I don't have a place to stay tonight.
6436095	eng	I don't feel like doing that anymore.
6436096	eng	I could've lied to you, but I didn't.
6436097	eng	I can't imagine that happening to me.
6436098	eng	I asked Tom to teach me how to drive.
6436099	eng	How much would you pay us to do that?
6436100	eng	How much water does this bucket hold?
6436101	eng	How much time did it take to do that?
6436102	eng	How much snow do you think we'll get?
6436103	eng	How much more do we need to do today?
6436104	eng	How much money have you saved so far?
6436105	eng	How much money has Tom stolen so far?
6436106	eng	How much money does a carpenter make?
6436107	eng	How much money does Tom save a month?
6436108	eng	How much do you make teaching French?
6436109	eng	How much candy do you think Tom eats?
6436110	eng	How much candy did Tom eat yesterday?
6436111	eng	How much can we really depend on Tom?
6436112	eng	How many times a day do you kiss Tom?
6436113	eng	How many pounds have you lost so far?
6436114	eng	How long would it take us to do that?
6436115	eng	How do you know Tom didn't kiss Mary?
6436116	eng	How did you know Tom would kiss Mary?
6436117	eng	How did you get Tom to let you drive?
6436118	eng	Have you told Tom that you love Mary?
6436119	eng	Do you think Tom will let Mary drive?
6436120	eng	Do you think I need to pay this bill?
6436123	eng	Do you and Tom ever discuss politics?
6436124	eng	Do Tom and Mary still live in Boston?
6436125	eng	Did Mary tell you she was Tom's wife?
6436126	eng	Are you still working as a bartender?
6436127	eng	You shouldn't have brought Tom here.
6436128	eng	You should never have let Tom drive.
6436129	eng	You don't have to be so mean to Tom.
6436130	eng	Will Tom drive to Boston by himself?
6436131	eng	Why weren't you in school yesterday?
6436132	eng	Why do you think Tom should do that?
6436133	eng	Why do you think Tom has to do that?
6436134	eng	Who told Tom he could join the team?
6436135	eng	Who kissed Tom first, Mary or Alice?
6436136	eng	Who else would want to see Tom dead?
6436137	eng	Who did Tom say he saw kissing Mary?
6436138	eng	Which one do you think Tom will buy?
6436139	eng	Where do you think Tom will do that?
6436140	eng	When did you start dyeing your hair?
6436141	eng	What's your plan for this afternoon?
6436142	eng	What would Tom say if Mary did that?
6436143	eng	What was Tom doing in Boston anyway?
6436144	eng	What if Tom doesn't know what to do?
6436145	eng	What did you buy at the supermarket?
6436146	eng	What Tom wanted was to be left alone.
6436147	eng	We need to find out where Tom works.
6436148	eng	We need to find out where Tom lives.
6436149	eng	Tom's brother looks a lot like John.

6436412	eng	I've got lots of other things to do.
6436413	eng	I've been watching Tom very closely.
6436414	eng	I'm not sure Tom would let me drive.
6436415	eng	I'm not sure Tom will agree to this.
6436416	eng	I'm currently living on Park Street.
6436417	eng	I'll probably be here all afternoon.
6436418	eng	I'd suggest not staying up too late.
6436419	eng	I would've driven if Tom had let me.
6436420	eng	I wonder why Tom wouldn't help Mary.
6436421	eng	I won't come back here anytime soon.
6436422	eng	I went home without buying anything.
6436423	eng	I want you to start studying French.
6436424	eng	I thought Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
6436425	eng	I think you should ask Tom to drive.
6436426	eng	I think you need to stop doing that.
6436427	eng	I think that's going to happen soon.
6436428	eng	I think Tom won't lie to us anymore.
6436429	eng	I think Tom did what he said he did.
6436430	eng	I think I've heard that name before.
6436431	eng	I think I won't be able afford that.
6436432	eng	I suppose I really ought to do that.
6436433	eng	I saw Tom on the beach this morning.
6436434	eng	I let Tom talk me into helping Mary.
6436435	eng	I know what Tom is capable of doing.
6436436	eng	I hope Tom won't be the one driving.
6436437	eng	I haven't kissed Tom in a long time.
6436438	eng	I don't think Tom will give it back.
6436439	eng	I don't kiss Tom very often anymore.
6436440	eng	I can't stand people who always lie.
6436441	eng	I can't remember what happened next.
6436442	eng	I bet you wish you hadn't done that.
6436443	eng	How much tea do you drink every day?
6436444	eng	How much sugar do you eat every day?
6436445	eng	How much money do you usually carry?

6436450	eng	How long did you spend at the beach?
6436451	eng	Has Tom ever asked you to help Mary?
6436452	eng	Don't forget that Tom is my brother.
6436453	eng	Don't be in such a hurry to do that.
6436454	eng	Do you think Tom would let me drive?
6436455	eng	Do you think Tom will let you drive?
6436456	eng	Do you think Tom will find anything?
6436457	eng	Do you think Tom will agree to this?

6436460	eng	Do you still have a house in Boston?
6436461	eng	Do Tom and Mary still live with you?
6436462	eng	Did Tom really lie to me about that?
6436464	eng	You won't be able to do that today.
6436465	eng	You should've kissed Tom goodnight.
6436466	eng	You all don't speak French, do you?
6436467	eng	Why wouldn't Tom want to kiss Mary?
6436468	eng	Why would Tom want me to help Mary?
6436469	eng	Why weren't you at today's meeting?

6436722	eng	Let me go back and get an umbrella.
6436723	eng	Lend me a hand with this, will you?
6436724	eng	It's no secret that Tom likes Mary.
6436725	eng	It's my intention to do that today.
6436726	eng	It's hard to tell what Tom will do.
6436727	eng	It's going to take time to do that.
6436728	eng	It's going to be tiring to do that.
6436729	eng	It might be easy for us to do that.
6436730	eng	It might be easy for me to do that.
6436731	eng	It might be a good idea to do that.
6436732	eng	It didn't take Tom long to do that.
6436734	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from baseball.

6436743	eng	I won't let Tom drive my car again.
6436744	eng	I won't ever try hugging Tom again.
6436745	eng	I wish I hadn't lied to the police.
6436746	eng	I wish I could live on Park Street.
6436747	eng	I was tempted to lie, but I didn't.
6436748	eng	I usually take a shower before bed.
6436749	eng	I tried to persuade Tom to help me.
6436750	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to help me.
6436751	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to do that.
6436752	eng	I think you should stop doing that.
6436753	eng	I think that this is Tom's bicycle.

6436764	eng	I don't think Tom sees it that way.
6436765	eng	I don't think Tom misses Mary much.
6436766	eng	I didn't think you'd let Tom drive.
6436767	eng	I asked Tom to hang up the laundry.
6436768	eng	I asked Tom to buy some rat poison.
6436769	eng	I almost didn't kiss Tom yesterday.
6436770	eng	How often do you hug your children?
6436771	eng	How much more weight should I lose?
6436772	eng	How much money was actually stolen?
6436773	eng	How much money does a teacher make?
6436774	eng	How much money does a plumber make?
6436775	eng	How much money did you spend on it?
6436776	eng	How much coffee do you drink a day?
6436777	eng	How much can you make washing cars?

6436780	eng	How many days ago did you buy this?
6436781	eng	How many days ago did you buy milk?
6436782	eng	How do you know what you should do?
6436783	eng	How can people do things like that?
6436784	eng	Give me a hand with this, will you?

6437124	eng	It's going to be risky to do that.
6437125	eng	It's going to be cheap to do that.
6437126	eng	It's definitely a dream come true.

6437142	eng	I'll be watching Tom very closely.
6437143	eng	I'd have driven if Tom had let me.
6437144	eng	I wonder why Tom let Mary do that.

6437147	eng	I won't ever try doing that again.
6437148	eng	I won't drive to Boston by myself.
6437149	eng	I trust you to do the right thing.
