6413486	eng	Mary probably doesn't know what she needs to buy.
6413487	eng	Mary probably doesn't know she shouldn't do that.
6413488	eng	Mary pretended that she didn't know Tom was rich.
6413489	eng	Mary pretended she didn't see Tom do what he did.
6413490	eng	Mary pretended she didn't know what was going on.

6413497	eng	Mary never told me she used to be married to Tom.

6413499	eng	Mary never should've told Tom that she loved him.
6413500	eng	Mary never has apologized for what she did to us.
6413501	eng	Mary must've traveled a lot when she was younger.
6413502	eng	Mary might not have done what people say she did.

6413514	eng	Mary let us know that she didn't mind doing that.
6413515	eng	Mary let Tom know she didn't know how to do that.
6413516	eng	Mary learned how to swim when she was very young.
6413517	eng	Mary learned how to do that when she was a child.
6413518	eng	Mary learned how to do that from her grandfather.
6413519	eng	Mary laughed when I told her about what happened.
6413520	eng	Mary knows she's not supposed to do that anymore.
6413521	eng	Mary knows she'll never be able to do that again.
6413522	eng	Mary knows Tom better than she knows anyone else.
6413523	eng	Mary knew there was nothing she could do to help.
6413524	eng	Mary knew that she was going to get into trouble.
6413525	eng	Mary knew she wasn't going to be able to do that.
6413526	eng	Mary knew she didn't have enough time to do that.
6413527	eng	Mary kept working even though she was very tired.
6413528	eng	Mary kept on walking even though she was in pain.
6413529	eng	Mary isn't really going to eat that frog, is she?
6413530	eng	Mary isn't going to go to Boston with us, is she?
6413531	eng	Mary isn't doing what she's supposed to be doing.
6413532	eng	Mary isn't as good at French as you think she is.
6413533	eng	Mary is wearing clothes that are too big for her.

6413544	eng	Mary is likely going to lose everything she owns.
6413545	eng	Mary is going to try to convince you to help her.
6413546	eng	Mary is going to try to convince Tom to help her.
6413547	eng	Mary is going to get very dirty if she does that.
6413548	eng	Mary is going to get killed if she's not careful.
6413549	eng	Mary is going to get in trouble if she does that.
6413550	eng	Mary is going to do whatever she can to help you.
6413551	eng	Mary is going to do that the way you told her to.
6413552	eng	Mary is going to do everything you ask her to do.
6413553	eng	Mary is going to do everything she's asked to do.
6413554	eng	Mary is going to be very glad she didn't do that.
6413555	eng	Mary is going to be fired if she does that again.
6413556	eng	Mary is going to be fined if she does that again.
6413557	eng	Mary is going to be exhausted when she gets home.
6413558	eng	Mary is fairly sure she can take care of herself.
6413559	eng	Mary is already old enough to do that by herself.
6413560	eng	Mary is a little bit tired, so she won't do that.
6413561	eng	Mary introduced herself to the rest of the class.
6413562	eng	Mary immigrated to Australia when she was thirty.
6413563	eng	Mary hid under her bed, but her mother found her.
6413564	eng	Mary helped herself to another dish of ice cream.
6413565	eng	Mary hasn't yet told us what she wants us to buy.
6413566	eng	Mary hasn't yet told me why she needs to do that.
6413567	eng	Mary hasn't yet realized that she's made a mistake.

6413574	eng	Mary has never gone mountain climbing by herself.
6413575	eng	Mary has never apologized for what she did to us.
6413576	eng	Mary has finally done what she promised she'd do.
6413577	eng	Mary has done that more than she'd like to admit.
6413578	eng	Mary has been waiting for Tom to do that for her.
6413579	eng	Mary has been doing that ever since she got home.
6413580	eng	Mary had enough time to do what she wanted to do.
6413581	eng	Mary had enough time to do what she needed to do.
6413582	eng	Mary had enough money to buy what she had to buy.
6413583	eng	Mary gave me three reasons why she couldn't help.
6413584	eng	Mary gave away most of her money before she died.
6413585	eng	Mary gave Tom the note I'd given her to give him.
6413586	eng	Mary gave Tom exactly what he told her he needed.
6413587	eng	Mary forgot to tell Tom what time she'd be there.
6413588	eng	Mary forgot to lock the front door when she left.
6413589	eng	Mary finally noticed that Tom was staring at her.
6413590	eng	Mary finally managed to persuade Tom to help her.
6413591	eng	Mary figured if Tom could do that, she could too.
6413592	eng	Mary expects all three of us to do that with her.
6413593	eng	Mary expected Tom to sit with her at the concert.
6413594	eng	Mary dropped out of school when she was thirteen.
6413595	eng	Mary doesn't want anyone to know that she's rich.
6413596	eng	Mary doesn't want Tom to go anywhere without her.
6413597	eng	Mary doesn't think they'll permit her to do that.
6413598	eng	Mary doesn't think Tom will allow her to do that.
6413599	eng	Mary doesn't really want to live there, does she?
6413600	eng	Mary doesn't really think Tom did that, does she?
6413601	eng	Mary doesn't really care whether she wins or not.
6413602	eng	Mary doesn't need to come if she doesn't want to.

6413608	eng	Mary doesn't have to sing if she doesn't want to.
6413609	eng	Mary doesn't have to help if she doesn't want to.
6413610	eng	Mary doesn't have to come if she doesn't want to.
6413611	eng	Mary doesn't have Tom to do that for her anymore.
6413612	eng	Mary doesn't deserve the salary we're paying her.
6413613	eng	Mary does that the way Tom taught her to do that.
6413614	eng	Mary does just about everything we ask her to do.
6413615	eng	Mary died three days after she arrived in Boston.
6413616	eng	Mary didn't want the same thing to happen to her.
6413617	eng	Mary didn't think Tom would allow her to do that.
6413618	eng	Mary didn't tell the stranger who she really was.
6413619	eng	Mary didn't tell me why she wanted me to do that.
6413620	eng	Mary didn't tell me she wanted to be a scientist.
6413621	eng	Mary didn't tell anyone what she was about to do.
6413622	eng	Mary didn't really enjoy eating with us, did she?
6413623	eng	Mary didn't provide details of how she'd do that.
6413624	eng	Mary didn't pay me as much as she said she'd pay.
6413625	eng	Mary didn't mention where she was planning to go.
6413626	eng	Mary didn't lose as much weight as she wanted to.
6413627	eng	Mary didn't look like she was having a good time.
6413628	eng	Mary didn't know why she was supposed to do that.
6413629	eng	Mary didn't know that she didn't need to do that.
6413630	eng	Mary didn't know that she didn't have to do that.
6413631	eng	Mary didn't know she no longer needed to do that.
6413632	eng	Mary didn't know for certain where she should go.
6413633	eng	Mary didn't do that as well as I expected her to.
6413634	eng	Mary didn't call Tom like she promised she would.
6413635	eng	Mary did better this time than she did last time.
6413636	eng	Mary definitely knows that she shouldn't be here.
6413637	eng	Mary couldn't have done that by herself, I think.
6413638	eng	Mary couldn't get Tom to tell her what was wrong.
6413639	eng	Mary couldn't do anything she was supposed to do.
6413640	eng	Mary couldn't decide what she should buy for Tom.
6413641	eng	Mary couldn't borrow as much money as she needed.
6413642	eng	Mary could've won if she'd tried a little harder.
6413643	eng	Mary could've refused to do that, but she didn't.
6413644	eng	Mary could've done better if she'd had more time.
6413645	eng	Mary could stay with us tonight if she wanted to.
6413646	eng	Mary could be busy now, but I don't think she is.
6413647	eng	Mary convinced Tom to buy her an expensive watch.
6413648	eng	Mary continued to do that until the day she died.
6413649	eng	Mary certainly did everything we asked her to do.
6413650	eng	Mary can't really see anything from where she is.
6413651	eng	Mary can't play the piano as well as she used to.
6413652	eng	Mary can't cook very well, so she often eats out.
6413653	eng	Mary called the office to say that she'd be late.
6413654	eng	Mary bragged about how well she could play chess.
6413655	eng	Mary began writing poems when she was very young.
6413656	eng	Mary became a French teacher when she was thirty.
6413657	eng	Mary assured Tom that she wouldn't do that again.
6413658	eng	Mary asked me whether she should help Tom or not.
6413659	eng	Mary asked me to give her enough time to do that.
6413660	eng	Mary asked me if she could borrow thirty dollars.
6413661	eng	Mary asked me if I would help her move her piano.
6413662	eng	Mary asked if she was really required to do that.
6413663	eng	Mary asked if she really needed to wear a helmet.
6413664	eng	Mary asked her father to help her make a snowman.
6413665	eng	Mary asked Tom to lend her three hundred dollars.
6413666	eng	Mary asked Tom not to kiss her in public anymore.
6413667	eng	Mary apparently didn't do what she said she'd do.
6413668	eng	Mary always tries to do what she thinks is right.
6413669	eng	Mary already knows that Tom wants her to do that.
6413670	eng	Mary allowed Tom to sit next to her on the bench.
6413671	eng	Mary admitted she didn't want to do that anymore.
6413672	eng	Let's hope Mary didn't do what you think she did.
6413673	eng	It's entirely up to Mary whether she goes or not.
6413674	eng	It was easy for Mary to convince Tom to help her.
6413675	eng	Is Mary wearing the new shirt you bought for her?
6413676	eng	If you don't do what Mary says, she'll get angry.
6413677	eng	I'm sure Mary wouldn't have done that by herself.
6413678	eng	I'm sure Mary understands what we want her to do.
6413679	eng	I'm pretty sure Mary did what we asked her to do.
6413680	eng	I'm going to allow Mary to do whatever she wants.
6413681	eng	I'm certain Mary will do what she says she'll do.
6413682	eng	I'll make sure Mary does what we asked her to do.
6413683	eng	I wonder whether Mary thought she had to do that.
6413684	eng	I wonder whether Mary really meant what she said.
6413685	eng	I wonder whether Mary knew she needed to do that.
6413686	eng	I wonder whether Mary did what she said she'd do.
6413687	eng	I wonder if Mary's friends would really help her.
6413688	eng	I wonder if Mary really can take care of herself.
6413689	eng	I wonder if Mary did what she was supposed to do.
6413690	eng	I wonder if Mary can really take care of herself.
6413691	eng	I wonder if Mary asked Tom to eat lunch with her.
6413692	eng	I wasn't sure what Mary wanted me to buy for her.
6413693	eng	I tried to get Mary to help me, but she wouldn't.
6413694	eng	I told Mary that she shouldn't go out after dark.
6413695	eng	I told Mary that I never wanted to see her again.
6413696	eng	I thought Mary wouldn't enjoy camping by herself.
6413697	eng	I thought Mary said she liked this kind of music.
6413698	eng	I think we shouldn't let Mary do that by herself.
6413699	eng	I think that Mary lied to you about what she did.
6413700	eng	I think Mary went into the woods to kill herself.
6413701	eng	I think Mary shouldn't tell Tom why she did that.
6413702	eng	I think Mary shouldn't tell Tom how she did that.
6413703	eng	I think Mary might get punished if she does that.
6413704	eng	I think Mary is sure that's what she needs to do.
6413705	eng	I think Mary could do better if she tried harder.
6413706	eng	I should've told Mary that she needed to do that.
6413707	eng	I should tell Mary I won't go to Boston with her.
6413708	eng	I should probably tell Mary what she needs to do.
6413709	eng	I looked Mary in the eyes and told her the truth.
6413710	eng	I knew Mary would ask Tom to eat dinner with her.
6413711	eng	I hope Mary remembers where she buried the money.
6413712	eng	I hope Mary does everything she's promised to do.
6413713	eng	I hope Mary didn't do what we told her not to do.
6413714	eng	I haven't spoken with Mary since she got married.
6413715	eng	I don't think Mary will be doing that by herself.
6413716	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom is ignoring her.
6413717	eng	I don't think Mary knows who's going to help her.
6413718	eng	I don't think Mary knows she's going to be fired.
6413719	eng	I don't think Mary knows how Tom feels about her.
6413720	eng	I don't think Mary has ever done that by herself.
6413721	eng	I didn't want Mary to leave, but she left anyway.
6413722	eng	I didn't think Mary would be afraid, but she was.
6413723	eng	I didn't notice that Mary was sitting by herself.
6413724	eng	I didn't know Mary would go to Boston by herself.
6413725	eng	I didn't give Mary the information she requested.
6413726	eng	I didn't believe Mary when she said she loved me.
6413727	eng	I can't find Mary. I think she must've gone home.
6413728	eng	I asked Mary why she did that the way she did it.
6413729	eng	I asked Mary when she thought Tom would get here.
6413730	eng	I asked Mary if she wanted to go and she said no.
6413731	eng	How often does Mary wear that scarf you gave her?
6413732	eng	How much time did it take Mary to clean her room?
6413733	eng	How long did Mary say she'd been studying French?
6413734	eng	How did Mary know she wasn't supposed to do that?
6413735	eng	Have you ever asked Mary why she doesn't do that?
6413736	eng	Either Mary doesn't want to do that or she can't.
6413737	eng	Does Mary know we can't do that without her help?
6413738	eng	Do you want to know why Mary did that by herself?
6413739	eng	Do you think Mary can still take care of herself?
6413740	eng	Did you tell Mary she's not allowed in this room?
6413741	eng	Did you know Mary before she came to work for us?
6413742	eng	Did you ask Mary if she could do that by herself?
6413743	eng	Did Mary say it was necessary for her to do that?
6413744	eng	Did Mary ever tell you what she wanted you to do?
6413745	eng	Did Mary actually do everything she said she did?
6413746	eng	Could you please tell Mary I need to talk to her?
6413747	eng	Can you please just give Mary whatever she wants?
6413748	eng	Ask Mary if she really needs to be there by 2:30.
6413749	eng	As soon as Mary heard the phone, she answered it.
6413750	eng	You'd think they'd tell Mary what she should do.
6413751	eng	You should've told Mary that she had to do that.
6413752	eng	You should've let Mary do what she wanted to do.
6413753	eng	You should tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
6413754	eng	You not only look like Mary, you sound like her.
6413755	eng	You can't make Mary help if she doesn't want to.
6413756	eng	You asked Mary if she could do that, didn't you?
6413757	eng	Would you tell Mary why you want her to do that?
6413758	eng	Would you just tell Mary what she did was wrong?
6413759	eng	Why should Mary insist that Tom do that for her?
6413760	eng	Why don't you just tell Mary you don't like her?
6413761	eng	Why don't you just tell Mary you don't like her.
6413762	eng	Why don't you ask Mary what she thinks happened?
6413763	eng	Who did Mary think was going to do that for her?
6413764	eng	When do you think Mary will want us to help her?
6413765	eng	When Mary heard about what happened, she smiled.
6413766	eng	When I first met Mary, she was still a teenager.
6413767	eng	We simply can't just leave Mary here by herself.
6413768	eng	We should ask Mary what she thinks we should do.
6413769	eng	We know Mary will do whatever we tell her to do.
6413770	eng	We hope Mary will do what we've asked her to do.
6413771	eng	This is where Mary said she found the gold coin.
6413772	eng	They told Mary to stop doing what she was doing.
6413773	eng	The only person Mary says she'll talk to is Tom.
6413774	eng	Tell Mary I'd like to meet with her immediately.
6413775	eng	Talk to Mary and see what she thinks about this.
6413776	eng	Should we tell Mary she doesn't need to do that?
6413777	eng	Should we tell Mary she doesn't have to do that?
6413778	eng	Remind me to thank Mary the next time I see her.
6413779	eng	Please tell Mary what you think she ought to do.
6413780	eng	Please tell Mary what you think she needs to do.
6413781	eng	Please tell Mary that she's required to do that.
6413782	eng	Please tell Mary she has to do that before 2:30.
6413783	eng	Please tell Mary everything we want her to know.
6413784	eng	One of us will have to ask Mary what she thinks.
6413785	eng	Maybe Mary thought you wouldn't want to see her.
6413786	eng	Maybe Mary should quit before she hurts herself.
6413787	eng	Maybe Mary didn't do what everyone says she did.
6413788	eng	Mary's memory's getting worse as she gets older.
6413789	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me why she wanted to do that.
6413790	eng	Mary wouldn't tell Tom why she wouldn't do that.
6413791	eng	Mary wouldn't like it if she knew you were here.
6413792	eng	Mary wouldn't have let her own children do that.
6413793	eng	Mary wouldn't drink the coffee Tom made for her.
6413794	eng	Mary wouldn't do something like that by herself.
6413795	eng	Mary would've done that already if she knew how.
6413796	eng	Mary would've done that already if she could've.
6413797	eng	Mary would just like to know what she did wrong.
6413798	eng	Mary won't talk to Tom and he won't talk to her.
6413799	eng	Mary won't stay here as long you think she will.

6414423	eng	Will Mary really be able to do that by herself?
6414424	eng	Why would Mary insist that Tom do that for her?
6414425	eng	Why should Mary do that if she doesn't have to?
6414426	eng	Why do you think Mary won't do that by herself?
6414427	eng	Who did Mary think would pay her bills for her?
6414428	eng	When Mary found out the truth, she was furious.

6415010	eng	I think you should tell Mary that you love her.
6415011	eng	I think you should let Mary do that by herself.
6415012	eng	I think Mary would like you to do that for her.

6415024	eng	I never even got to tell Mary that I loved her.
6415025	eng	I looked around for Mary, but I didn't see her.

6415031	eng	I have a feeling Mary can take care of herself.
6415032	eng	I don't think Mary wants to do that by herself.
6415033	eng	I don't think Mary knows why Tom is mad at her.
6415034	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she needs to buy.
6415035	eng	I don't think Mary knows that I don't like her.

6415044	eng	How did Mary react when she saw Tom doing that?
6415045	eng	How did Mary get Tom to give her so much money?
6415046	eng	Has Mary told you why she doesn't want to stay?
6415047	eng	Find Mary and tell her to come here right away.
6415048	eng	Does Mary think she'll be in Boston all summer?
6415049	eng	Do you think Mary will let Tom do that for her?

6415059	eng	Ask Mary if she has anyone to help her do that.
6415060	eng	All Mary wanted was for Tom to leave her alone.
6415061	eng	You should just let Mary cry herself to sleep.
6415062	eng	You can't exactly blame Mary for what she did.
6415063	eng	Why would Mary do that if she doesn't have to?
6415064	eng	Who's going to tell Mary she can't go with us?
6415065	eng	Who did Mary think would lend her an umbrella?
6415066	eng	Who did Mary say she wanted to go skiing with?
6415067	eng	When I told Mary I'd done that, she got angry.
6415068	eng	When I first met Mary, I didn't like her much.

6415100	eng	Mary's friends asked her to come out and play.
6415101	eng	Mary's father doesn't allow her to drink wine.
6415102	eng	Mary's doctor advised her to give up drinking.
6415103	eng	Mary's at the door. Please ask her to come in.
6415104	eng	Mary wouldn't tell us where she hid the money.
6415105	eng	Mary wouldn't tell me why she didn't like Tom.
6415106	eng	Mary wouldn't tell Tom why she didn't do that.

6415852	eng	I don't really think Mary did that by herself.
6415853	eng	I don't know why Mary does that, but she does.
6415854	eng	I don't believe Mary can take care of herself.

6416538	eng	Mary didn't come here alone tonight, did she?
6416539	eng	Mary didn't buy everything she needed to buy.
6416540	eng	Mary did that, even though she didn't want to
6416541	eng	Mary did something she wasn't supposed to do.
6416542	eng	Mary did much more than what we asked her to.
6416543	eng	Mary did her best to persuade Tom to do that.
6416544	eng	Mary couldn't remember what Tom had told her.
6416545	eng	Mary couldn't do everything she needed to do.
6416546	eng	Mary could've solved that problem by herself.
6416547	eng	Mary could've said something, but she didn't.
6416548	eng	Mary could've come yesterday, but she didn't.
6416549	eng	Mary could swim when she was three years old.
6416550	eng	Mary could stay at our house if she wants to.
6416551	eng	Mary could hurt herself if she's not careful.
6416552	eng	Mary could hear Tom, but he couldn't see her.
6416553	eng	Mary could do that well when she was younger.
6416554	eng	Mary could do that if she put her mind to it.
6416555	eng	Mary confessed that she had stolen the money.
6416556	eng	Mary complained that she couldn't find a job.
6416557	eng	Mary closed the door as quietly as she could.

6416563	eng	Mary came to school even though she was sick.
6416564	eng	Mary called to say she'd be three hours late.
6416565	eng	Mary burned all the letters she got from Tom.
6416566	eng	Mary burned all the letters Tom had sent her.
6416567	eng	Mary blames herself for what happened to Tom.
6416568	eng	Mary assured us that she won't do that again.
6416569	eng	Mary asked me if she could close the windows.
6416570	eng	Mary asked me if she could borrow some money.
6416571	eng	Mary asked me if I could lend her some money.
6416572	eng	Mary asked if it would be OK if she did that.
6416573	eng	Mary asked Tom where she should park her car.
6416574	eng	Mary asked Tom what he thought she should do.
6416575	eng	Mary asked Tom to help her with her homework.
6416576	eng	Mary apologized to Tom for losing her temper.
6416577	eng	Mary and her boyfriend are in the same class.
6416578	eng	Mary almost killed herself trying to do that.
6416579	eng	Mary admitted that she ate all the ice cream.
6416580	eng	Let's ask Mary when she thinks she'll arrive.
6416581	eng	If that's what Mary said, then she was lying.
6416582	eng	If Mary came to Boston, where would she stay?
6416583	eng	I've already told Mary she can borrow my car.
6416584	eng	I'm sure Mary will wish she hadn't done that.
6416585	eng	I'm sure Mary will like the gift you got her.
6416586	eng	I'm not sure Mary would want Tom to kiss her.
6416587	eng	I'll make sure Mary has everything she needs.
6416588	eng	I wouldn't let Mary do what she wanted to do.
6416589	eng	I wonder why Mary thought she had to do that.
6416590	eng	I wonder if Mary really regrets what she did.
6416591	eng	I wish Mary had done what we asked her to do.
6416592	eng	I tried to hug Mary, but she wouldn't let me.
6416593	eng	I told Mary that she should apologize to Tom.
6416594	eng	I told Mary that I thought she could do that.
6416595	eng	I thought Mary would be angrier than she was.
6416596	eng	I think we'd better ask Mary what she thinks.
6416597	eng	I think we should let Mary do what she wants.
6416598	eng	I think we should ask Mary who told her that.
6416599	eng	I think Mary would leave if you asked her to.
6416600	eng	I think Mary said she needed to buy a shovel.
6416601	eng	I think Mary got home by herself last Monday.
6416602	eng	I think Mary expected Tom to ask her to stay.
6416603	eng	I think Mary didn't do what she said she did.
6416604	eng	I think Mary did that by herself last Monday.
6416605	eng	I think Mary could've gotten home by herself.
6416606	eng	I think Mary could help Tom if she wanted to.
6416607	eng	I think I heard Mary say that she'll do that.
6416608	eng	I sure hope Mary does what she said she'd do.
6416609	eng	I should've told Mary why she had to do that.
6416610	eng	I should tell Mary that she ought to do that.
6416611	eng	I should tell Mary that she needs to do that.
6416612	eng	I know Mary wants us to go swimming with her.
6416613	eng	I knew Mary would love the gift you gave her.
6416614	eng	I knew Mary would do what we asked her to do.
6416615	eng	I just want Mary to know that we'll miss her.
6416616	eng	I hope Mary doesn't say she wants to do that.
6416617	eng	I hope Mary doesn't say she needs to do that.
6416618	eng	I hope Mary didn't say she wanted to do that.
6416619	eng	I have to let Mary know what she needs to do.
6416620	eng	I expect Mary has her reasons for doing that.
6416621	eng	I don't think Mary knows where she should be.
6416622	eng	I don't think Mary knows what she has to buy.
6416623	eng	I don't think Mary did what Tom said she did.
6416624	eng	I didn't think Mary would do that by herself.
6416625	eng	I didn't tell Mary why she needed to do that.
6416626	eng	I didn't let Mary finish what she was saying.
6416627	eng	I didn't know Mary would ask Tom to help her.
6416628	eng	I didn't know Mary had to do that by herself.
6416629	eng	I didn't know Mary had asked Tom to help her.
6416630	eng	I didn't allow Mary do what she wanted to do.
6416631	eng	I asked Mary whether she wanted to go or not.
6416632	eng	I asked Mary to do that as soon as she could.
6416633	eng	How long does Mary expect us to wait for her?
6416634	eng	Have you told Mary why she shouldn't do that?
6416635	eng	Has Mary ever told you how she broke her leg?
6416636	eng	Has Mary decided where she'll go next summer?
6416637	eng	Find Mary and ask her what you just asked me.
6416638	eng	Everyone looked at Mary to see what she'd do.
6416639	eng	Does Mary think she can take care of herself?
6416640	eng	Does Mary stay with you when she's in Boston?
6416641	eng	Do you think Mary really meant what she said?
6416642	eng	Do you think Mary knew you were lying to her?
6416643	eng	Do you think Mary believed what you told her?
6416644	eng	Do you know if Mary can take care of herself?
6416645	eng	Did you know Mary before she joined the team?
6416646	eng	Did Mary say anything about who she was with?
6416647	eng	Did Mary say anything about where she'd been?
6416648	eng	Did Mary find the person she was looking for?
6416649	eng	Did Mary ever tell you how she first met Tom?
6416650	eng	Ask Mary if she wants to go swimming with us.
6416651	eng	Are you going to tell Mary that you love her?
6416652	eng	You'd better tell Mary what she needs to do.
6416653	eng	You told Mary she could do that, didn't you?
6416654	eng	You said Mary wouldn't kiss me, but she did.
6416655	eng	You can't blame Mary for doing what she did.
6416656	eng	You asked Mary why she did that, didn't you?
6416657	eng	Why should Mary need Tom to do that for her?
6416658	eng	Why don't you ask Mary what she plans to do?
6416659	eng	Where did Mary say she thought we should go?
6416660	eng	What does Mary want to be when she grows up?
6416661	eng	Was it you who told Mary she should do that?
6416662	eng	Was it you who told Mary she has to do that?
6416663	eng	Was it you who told Mary she had to do that?
6416664	eng	The police think that Mary poisoned herself.
6416665	eng	Tell Mary she should do that this afternoon.
6416666	eng	Tell Mary she needs to get home before 2:30.
6416667	eng	Since Mary is sick, she can't do that today.
6416668	eng	Please tell Mary she needs to do that today.
6416669	eng	Please let Mary do whatever she wants to do.
6416670	eng	Not even Mary could've done this by herself.
6416671	eng	None of Mary's friends knew where she lived.
6416672	eng	Maybe Mary saw something she shouldn't have.
6416673	eng	Maybe Mary doesn't know what she has to buy.
6416674	eng	Mary's light is on, so she's probably awake.
6416675	eng	Mary's husband picked her up at the airport.
6416676	eng	Mary's family is happy that she's back home.
6416677	eng	Mary wouldn't have let her children do that.
6416678	eng	Mary wouldn't do that if she didn't want to.
6416679	eng	Mary wouldn't do that if she didn't need to.
6416680	eng	Mary wouldn't do that if she didn't have to.
6416681	eng	Mary would've stayed longer if she could've.
6416682	eng	Mary would've helped you if you'd asked her.
6416683	eng	Mary would've gone with you if she could've.
6416684	eng	Mary would be in Boston now if she could be.
6416685	eng	Mary wondered where she was supposed to sit.
6416686	eng	Mary won't likely try to do that on her own.
6416687	eng	Mary won't likely try to do that by herself.
6416688	eng	Mary won't go away if you don't want her to.
6416689	eng	Mary won't be here today, because she's sick
6416690	eng	Mary wished she'd been invited to the party.
6416691	eng	Mary wished she hadn't asked Tom to do that.
6416692	eng	Mary wished she could stay in Boston longer.
6416693	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she's not tired.
6416694	eng	Mary will probably tell Tom she isn't tired.
6416695	eng	Mary will never find what she's looking for.
6416696	eng	Mary will never be able to do it by herself.
6416697	eng	Mary will need more money than what she has.
6416698	eng	Mary will hurt herself if she's not careful.
6416699	eng	Mary will hurt herself if she isn't careful.
6416700	eng	Mary will have to deal with that on her own.
6416701	eng	Mary will get into trouble if she does that.
6416702	eng	Mary will come if she's free this afternoon.
6416703	eng	Mary will be very hungry when she gets home.
6416704	eng	Mary will be really disappointed, won't she?
6416705	eng	Mary wasn't waiting where she said she'd be.
6416706	eng	Mary wasn't told she didn't need to do that.
6416707	eng	Mary wasn't told she didn't have to do that.
6416708	eng	Mary wasn't sure what Tom wanted her to buy.
6416709	eng	Mary wasn't as hungry as I thought she'd be.
6416710	eng	Mary wasn't as busy as Tom told me she'd be.
6416711	eng	Mary wasn't able to make herself understood.
6416712	eng	Mary was unable to take her eyes off of Tom.
6416713	eng	Mary was too scared to walk home by herself.
6416714	eng	Mary was the first one to say she'd do that.
6416715	eng	Mary was shocked when I told her what I did.
6416716	eng	Mary was really skinny when I first met her.
6416717	eng	Mary was overweight when she was a teenager.
6416718	eng	Mary was hoping that Tom would smile at her.
6416719	eng	Mary was here yesterday morning, wasn't she?
6416720	eng	Mary was angry because Tom was ignoring her.
6416721	eng	Mary wants to be a doctor when she grows up.
6416722	eng	Mary wants me to help her with her homework.
6416723	eng	Mary wants me to give her my old motorcycle.
6416724	eng	Mary wanted me to buy some firewood for her.
6416725	eng	Mary wanted Tom to meet some of her friends.
6416726	eng	Mary wanted Tom to help her clean the house.
6416727	eng	Mary wanted Tom to drive her to the airport.
6416728	eng	Mary used to snore, but she doesn't anymore.
6416729	eng	Mary used to drink a lot before she met Tom.
6416730	eng	Mary tried to kiss me, but I didn't let her.
6416731	eng	Mary tried to get Tom to pay for her ticket.
6416732	eng	Mary took more than one picture, didn't she?
6416733	eng	Mary told us she didn't think she'd do that.
6416734	eng	Mary told us she didn't think she could win.
6416735	eng	Mary told us about how nice you were to her.
6416736	eng	Mary told the police that she'd been robbed.
6416737	eng	Mary told me why she wasn't able to do that.
6416738	eng	Mary told me why she wanted to study French.

6417353	eng	I should've asked Mary if she could do that.
6417354	eng	I should tell Mary why Tom doesn't like her.
6417355	eng	I saw Mary looking at herself in the mirror.
6417356	eng	I know Mary will have to do that on her own.
6417357	eng	I know Mary didn't do what you said she did.

6420592	eng	This is where Mary told us to meet her.
6420593	eng	This is just what Mary said she wanted.
6420594	eng	That looks like Mary, but it isn't her.

6431136	eng	I think Tom may be able to buy the kind of shoes he's looking for at the sports store on Park Street.
6431137	eng	It's going to take longer to tell you how to do that than to just go ahead and do it myself.
6431138	eng	"Would you like to go to a movie this weekend?" "I'm sorry I can't, but thanks for asking."
6431139	eng	It's going to take longer to tell you how to do it than to just go ahead and do it myself.

6431146	eng	It's going to take at least one more hour to finish writing this report.
6431147	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take Tom to finish writing the report?
6431148	eng	The last time I saw Mary she was wearing a pink blouse and a red skirt.
6431149	eng	Mary was the only other girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431150	eng	It's going to take at least another hour to finish writing this report.
6431151	eng	I usually wake up at about six, but I don't get out of bed until seven.
6431152	eng	I can't speak French fluently yet, but I can understand it fairly well.

6431155	eng	Mary is the only other girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431156	eng	It's going to take a long time to do everything that needs to be done.
6431157	eng	I usually get up at six, but this morning I didn't get up until eight.
6431158	eng	I don't think it's a good idea for you to go out at night by yourself.
6431159	eng	How many more years do you think it'll take Tom graduate from college?
6431160	eng	It's going to take me at least three hours to do my homework tonight.

6431162	eng	The twins look so much alike that it's difficult to tell them apart.
6431163	eng	Mary wasn't the only girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431164	eng	It's probably going to take you about three hours to read this book.
6431165	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for you to do that by yourself.
6431166	eng	It's going to take me a long time to do all the things I want to do.
6431167	eng	It's going to cost us a lot of money to put a new roof on our house.
6431168	eng	If we don't find water we can drink, we won't survive on his island.
6431169	eng	I suggest that you don't tell Tom about where you spent the weekend.

6431178	eng	Mary's boyfriend saw her dancing with another guy and got jealous.
6431179	eng	It doesn't seem fair not to pay Tom the same as we're paying Mary.
6431180	eng	Does Tom really think he's the only one here who can speak French?
6431181	eng	When was the last time you read a bedtime story to your children?
6431182	eng	The weather's nice and it's our day off, so let's go on a picnic.
6431183	eng	It's going to take some time to shovel all the snow off the roof.
6431184	eng	It's going to take me more than three hours to finish doing this.
6431185	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't understand French.
6431186	eng	I don't think Tom has time today to do everything he needs to do.
6431187	eng	How much time do you think it'll take Tom to finish his homework?
6431188	eng	How much time do you estimate it'll take Tom to build a doghouse?
6431189	eng	After failing to make the Olympic team, Tom retired from fencing.
6431190	eng	Mary is the only girl who said she was interested in doing that.
6431191	eng	It's going to take you a few weeks to get used to wearing a wig.
6431192	eng	It's going to take a little time to get used to wearing glasses.
6431193	eng	It's going to be a long time before I can afford to buy a house.
6431194	eng	It doesn't make any difference to me whether you do that or not.
6431195	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what time Tom usually goes to bed.
6431196	eng	I wanted to hug you, but I knew it would embarrass you if I did.
6431197	eng	I think you should tell Tom why you won't go to Boston with him.
6431198	eng	I suggest that you lie to Tom about where you spent the weekend.
6431199	eng	I know Tom lives on Park Street, but I'm not exactly sure where.
6431200	eng	How much time do you estimate Tom will need to build a doghouse?
6431201	eng	How many more hours do you think Tom will be willing to help us?
6431202	eng	Tom told Mary she should lie about who she went to Boston with.

6431204	eng	Tom takes care of Mary's daughter whenever Mary goes to Boston.
6431205	eng	Tom studied French after dinner while his mother washed dishes.
6431206	eng	Tom says he doesn't think he can help you move the piano today.
6431207	eng	Tom said that he's pretty sure that Mary has seen John do that.
6431208	eng	Tom said that he saw Mary eating at a picnic table in the park.
6431209	eng	Tom said he thought there was a chance that Mary would do that.
6431210	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who knew how to do that.
6431211	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to eat anything she doesn't want to.
6431212	eng	Tom probably won't be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431213	eng	Tom parked his car in front of a fire hydrant and got a ticket.
6431214	eng	Tom just closed his eyes and tried to ignore what was going on.
6431215	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431216	eng	Tom is likely going to go to Boston during his summer vacation.
6431217	eng	Tom is likely going to be too busy to do that until after 2:30.
6431218	eng	Tom is going to eventually figure out it was Mary who did that.
6431219	eng	Tom didn't like Mary at all when they were both in high school.
6431220	eng	Tom called Mary to tell her he wouldn't be home until tomorrow.
6431221	eng	Tom and Mary tried to do that by themselves, but they couldn't.
6431222	eng	Tom and Mary moved to Boston where they opened an antique shop.
6431223	eng	How long do you think it would take us to get to Boston by car?
6431224	eng	Tom was the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to drive.
6431225	eng	Tom speaks perfect French, but his native language is English.
6431226	eng	Tom saw Mary sitting by herself on the bench next to the pond.
6431227	eng	Tom said that he wasn't interested in going to Boston with us.
6431228	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary didn't want to do that.
6431229	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary didn't need to do that.
6431230	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary didn't have to do that.
6431231	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary would be afraid to do that.
6431232	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't eat the soup if it had meat in it.
6431233	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be interested in doing that.
6431234	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be finished doing that by 2:30.
6431235	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that until October.
6431236	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that until October.
6431237	eng	Tom said he thought I might be permitted to do that by myself.
6431238	eng	Tom said he hoped he'd be able to buy what he needed for $300.
6431239	eng	Tom said he didn't think doing that would make any difference.
6431240	eng	Tom probably won't be able to help you clean the garage today.
6431241	eng	Tom knows that he should do something, but he's not sure what.
6431242	eng	Tom knows that he has to do something, but he's not sure what.
6431243	eng	Tom is probably going to get injured if he does that that way.
6431244	eng	Tom is probably going to be doing that early tomorrow morning.
6431245	eng	Tom is likely to lie to Mary about where he spent the weekend.
6431246	eng	Tom is likely going to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
6431247	eng	Tom is likely going to be able to talk Mary out of doing that.
6431248	eng	Tom is going to provide you with all the information you need.
6431249	eng	Tom is going to need at least $300 to buy everything he needs.
6431250	eng	Tom is going to leave for Boston first thing tomorrow morning.
6431251	eng	Tom is going to be finished doing that by the end of the week.
6431252	eng	Tom is going to be arriving tomorrow at 2:30 in the afternoon.
6431253	eng	Tom finished reading the letter and put it in his desk drawer.
6431254	eng	Tom and Mary have parties at their home several times a month.
6431255	eng	Tom and Mary are probably never going to see each other again.
6431256	eng	My parents died in an automobile accident when I was thirteen.
6431257	eng	Mary isn't the sort of girl who would do what you say she did.
6431258	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't want to do that together.
6431259	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to finish this job.
6431260	eng	I'm sure I'll eventually go to Boston. I just don't know when.
6431261	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom is aware that Mary has been arrested.
6431262	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive your car again.
6431263	eng	How many women have you talked to since you got out of prison?
6431264	eng	How many hours a week do you help out at the homeless shelter?
6431265	eng	You really should lie to Tom about where you were last night.
6431266	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in front of the library at 2:30.
6431267	eng	Tom was walking so fast that Mary couldn't catch up with him.
6431268	eng	Tom texted Mary to let her know that he'd be late for dinner.
6431269	eng	Tom said something to Mary, but I couldn't hear what he said.
6431270	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be through doing that by 2:30.
6431271	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was always in her office on Mondays.
6431272	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who wanted to do that.
6431273	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who needed to do that.
6431274	eng	Tom said he thought I might be required to do that by myself.
6431275	eng	Tom said Mary didn't have to eat anything she didn't want to.
6431276	eng	Tom promised me he'd buy me something to eat on the way home.
6431277	eng	Tom noticed Mary's new hairstyle, but he didn't say anything.
6431278	eng	Tom knows you didn't eat any of the cookies he baked for you.
6431279	eng	Tom knew Mary was looking for him, so he hid in the basement.
6431280	eng	Tom isn't going to be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431281	eng	Tom is the one who convinced Mary to teach John how to drive.
6431282	eng	Tom is probably going to figure out it was Mary who did that.
6431283	eng	Tom is going to have to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?
6431284	eng	Tom is going to buy his mother some flowers for Mother's Day.
6431285	eng	Tom is going to be the first one in our class to get married.
6431286	eng	Tom is going to be disappointed if you don't go to his party.
6431287	eng	Tom has been looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431288	eng	Tom couldn't help us today, because he was busy helping Mary.
6431289	eng	Tom and Mary talked on the phone with each other all evening.
6431290	eng	Tom and Mary take a walk together after dinner every evening.
6431291	eng	Tom and Mary started doing that when they were both thirteen.
6431292	eng	Tom and Mary helped their mother decorate the Christmas tree.
6431293	eng	That's an interesting idea, but I don't think we can do that.
6431294	eng	Mary doesn't like it when her boyfriend kisses her in public.
6431295	eng	Mary called her mother and told her she'd be late for dinner.
6431296	eng	It's going to take Tom three hours to finish what he's doing.
6431297	eng	It's going to be difficult to complete this report by Monday.
6431298	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, please wait on the porch.
6431299	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't want to drive.
6431300	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431301	eng	I don't think Tom has time to buy everything he needs to buy.
6431302	eng	I don't have to go into the office until 2:30 this afternoon.
6431303	eng	Apparently, that's the only way we can get that done in time.
6431304	eng	Tom will probably feel better once he gets something to eat.
6431305	eng	Tom was supposed to meet me in the lobby, but he never came.
6431306	eng	Tom was shocked when he learned that Mary had been arrested.
6431307	eng	Tom wanted to do that this afternoon, but I told him not to.
6431308	eng	Tom told Mary he wouldn't eat the stew if it had pork in it.
6431309	eng	Tom thought that the best solution was to ask Mary to leave.
6431310	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wanted to do that.
6431311	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary needed to do that.
6431312	eng	Tom said he wanted me to help him paint his garage tomorrow.

6431317	eng	Tom said he thought I might be allowed to do that by myself.
6431318	eng	Tom said Mary doesn't have to eat anything she doesn't like.
6431319	eng	Tom refused to tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431320	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that anymore.
6431321	eng	Tom is probably going to ask Mary for permission to do that.
6431322	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do this.
6431323	eng	Tom is never going to understand why we want him to do that.
6431324	eng	Tom is likely going to be able to talk Mary into doing that.
6431325	eng	Tom is going to keep doing that if someone doesn't stop him.
6431326	eng	Tom is going to get into trouble if he eats all the cookies.
6431327	eng	Tom is going to get in trouble if he eats all the ice cream.
6431328	eng	Tom is going to get himself killed if he's not more careful.
6431329	eng	Tom is going to be staying with us for the next three weeks.
6431330	eng	Tom decided not to tell his parents about what had happened.
6431331	eng	Tom called to let me know he wouldn't be coming to my party.
6431332	eng	Tom and Mary will be leaving for Australia tomorrow morning.
6431333	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never going to see each other again.
6431334	eng	There's something on that shelf that both Tom and Mary want.
6431335	eng	The weather's nice and it's my day off, so I'm going hiking.
6431336	eng	The picnic was held in the gymnasium because it was raining.
6431337	eng	Ninety percent of the time Tom doesn't know what he's doing.
6431338	eng	Mary said she didn't think Tom was ready to become a father.
6431339	eng	If Tom doesn't get an A on the test, his mother will be mad.
6431340	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you've never done that.
6431341	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't speak French.
6431342	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you eat his piece of cake.
6431343	eng	How many times a week does Tom help at the homeless shelter?
6431344	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me how much he paid for his new computer.
6431345	eng	Tom would've let you drive if you'd told him you wanted to.
6431346	eng	Tom will tell Mary everything he knows about the situation.
6431347	eng	Tom will lose his job if he keeps showing up late for work.
6431348	eng	Tom was playing basketball this afternoon with his friends.
6431349	eng	Tom was hoping Mary wouldn't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431350	eng	Tom tried to pick up Mary's suitcase, but it was too heavy.
6431351	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably in the cafeteria, eating lunch.
6431352	eng	Tom said that he wasn't certain that Mary wouldn't do that.
6431353	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary had been told not to do that.
6431354	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she was supposed to do.
6431355	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still waiting in the lobby.
6431356	eng	Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weed the garden today.
6431357	eng	Tom said he thought there was a chance that Mary would win.
6431358	eng	Tom said he thought he might be permitted to do that today.
6431359	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the first one to do that.
6431360	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be interested in doing that.
6431361	eng	Tom said he thought Mary seemed to be desperate to do that.
6431362	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not need to do that anymore.
6431363	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that anymore.
6431364	eng	Tom said Mary didn't want to eat Chinese food this evening.
6431365	eng	Tom recognized Mary as soon as she walked through the door.
6431366	eng	Tom is probably going to get hurt if he does that that way.
6431367	eng	Tom is probably going to be ready by the time we get there.
6431368	eng	Tom is probably going to be drunk by the time we get there.
6431369	eng	Tom is never going to understand why people don't like him.
6431370	eng	Tom is never going to live up to his parents' expectations.
6431371	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without your help.
6431372	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without some help.
6431373	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that before lunch.
6431374	eng	Tom is going to help you as soon as he finishes doing that.
6431375	eng	Tom is going to have to do that even if he doesn't want to.

6431383	eng	Tom announced that he'd be retiring at the end of the year.
6431384	eng	Tom and Mary were supposed to meet each other in the lobby.
6431385	eng	Tom and Mary say they want to have at least three children.
6431386	eng	Tom and Mary have three children under the age of thirteen.
6431387	eng	The only language I can speak other than French is English.
6431388	eng	It's just not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431389	eng	It's hard to believe that Tom would do something like that.
6431390	eng	It's going to take some time to finish unloading the truck.
6431391	eng	It's going to take a little time to get used to doing this.
6431392	eng	It's going to be a long time before I try doing that again.
6431393	eng	It wasn't clear on Monday whether Tom would do that or not.
6431394	eng	If I'm not home when you get there, just wait on the porch.
6431395	eng	I wouldn't have done that if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431396	eng	I was the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431397	eng	I have a sore throat, so I don't know if I can sing or not.

6431400	eng	How many hours do you think it'll take Tom to mow the lawn?
6431401	eng	How many hours do you think it took Tom paint this picture?
6431402	eng	How different is driving a truck compared to driving a car?
6431403	eng	Do you really have enough money to buy everything you want?
6431404	eng	Do you really have enough money to buy everything you need?
6431405	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary were going to be there.
6431406	eng	Tom wouldn't be helping us today if Mary hadn't asked him.
6431407	eng	Tom wished he hadn't asked Mary to teach him how to drive.
6431408	eng	Tom wasn't waiting for Mary where he said he'd be waiting.
6431409	eng	Tom was shocked when he heard that Mary had been arrested.
6431410	eng	Tom was only three years old when he first came to Boston.
6431411	eng	Tom wanted to remind Mary not to forget about the meeting.
6431412	eng	Tom wanted to explain everything to Mary, but he couldn't.
6431413	eng	Tom wanted to apologize to Mary, but he couldn't find her.
6431414	eng	Tom took care of Mary's daughter while Mary was in Boston.
6431415	eng	Tom told me yesterday that he wouldn't be at school today.

6431420	eng	Tom takes the dog for a walk every afternoon after school.
6431421	eng	Tom shouted as loud as he could, but Mary didn't hear him.
6431422	eng	Tom saw Mary eating by herself at a table near the window.
6431423	eng	Tom said that he wasn't responsible for what had happened.
6431424	eng	Tom said that Mary looked like she was enjoying the party.
6431425	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be concerned about that.
6431426	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't attend this afternoon's meeting.
6431427	eng	Tom said that Mary could've probably done that by herself.
6431428	eng	Tom said he thought he might be required to do that today.
6431429	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the next one to do that.
6431430	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be the last one to do that.
6431431	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the best singer in his class.
6431432	eng	Tom said he thought I was the only one who had to do that.
6431433	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that by myself.
6431434	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that by myself.
6431435	eng	Tom said he thought I might be permitted to do that today.
6431436	eng	Tom knows Mary will probably be hungry when she gets home.
6431437	eng	Tom knew that Mary would be drunk by the time he got home.
6431438	eng	Tom is probably not going to have any fun at Mary's party.
6431439	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he won't do that again.
6431440	eng	Tom is probably going to sing that new song he just wrote.
6431441	eng	Tom is probably going to go swimming again this afternoon.
6431442	eng	Tom is probably going to be very hungry when he gets home.
6431443	eng	Tom is probably going to be gone by the time we get there.
6431444	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without our help.
6431445	eng	Tom is likely going to spend the rest of his life in jail.
6431446	eng	Tom is going to try to find out why Mary wants to do that.
6431447	eng	Tom is going to try to convince Mary to accept your offer.
6431448	eng	Tom is going to talk to Mary about that when he gets here.

6431456	eng	Tom didn't want to help us today, but he helped us anyway.
6431457	eng	Tom convinced himself that what he was doing wasn't wrong.
6431458	eng	Tom and Mary will sit at the same table as John and Alice.
6431459	eng	Tom and Mary are unlikely to eat anything I make for them.
6431460	eng	Tom and Mary are going to eat dinner with us this evening.
6431461	eng	The table I'm planning to give away is in the living room.
6431462	eng	The police officer handcuffed Tom's hands behind his back.
6431463	eng	My parents died in an automobile accident three years ago.
6431464	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to finish this.
6431465	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to wearing a wig.
6431466	eng	In case of rain, the picnic will be held in the gymnasium.
6431467	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from boxing and returned to teaching.
6431468	eng	If you do that this way, you'll be able to save some time.
6431469	eng	I can't force you to do that, but you really should do it.
6431470	eng	How old were you when you and Tom first kissed each other?
6431471	eng	How much do you think I should pay Tom to rotate my tires?
6431472	eng	How much did Tom pay you to help him clean out his garage?
6431473	eng	Have you told Tom why he shouldn't be doing that that way?
6431474	eng	Even though it was raining, we went out for a walk anyway.
6431475	eng	Do you think Tom was the one who taught Mary how to drive?
6431476	eng	Could you tell me what time the meeting is going to start?
6431477	eng	When Tom told Mary that he'd kissed Alice, she got upset.
6431478	eng	Tom, Mary and their children went to Boston last weekend.
6431479	eng	Tom's house is a five-minute walk from the train station.
6431480	eng	Tom went into the kitchen to help his mother make dinner.
6431481	eng	Tom used the money Mary gave him to buy something to eat.
6431482	eng	Tom told me he wanted me to buy a couple of loaves bread.
6431483	eng	Tom told Mary that he wouldn't be able to help her today.
6431484	eng	Tom told Mary he wanted John to teach Alice how to drive.

6431494	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary was in Boston anymore.
6431495	eng	Tom said that Mary would probably be too busy to do that.
6431496	eng	Tom said that Mary was responsible for what had happened.
6431497	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to go to Boston to see John.
6431498	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't be able to cheer Mary up.
6431499	eng	Tom said he thought he might be allowed to do that today.
6431500	eng	Tom said he thought he knew what had caused the accident.
6431501	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be awake when he got home.
6431502	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the best player on the team.
6431503	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
6431504	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was difficult to get along with.
6431505	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that on Monday.
6431506	eng	Tom said he thought Mary had already finished doing that.
6431507	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that tomorrow.
6431508	eng	Tom said he thinks his parents are going to get divorced.
6431509	eng	Tom said he didn't think he was ready to become a father.
6431510	eng	Tom ought to tell Mary not to eat the fruit on that tree.
6431511	eng	Tom knows there are plenty of people who agree with Mary.
6431512	eng	Tom knew that Mary couldn't eat anything with nuts in it.
6431513	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary why he had to do that.
6431514	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary that he can't do that.
6431515	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he intends to do that.
6431516	eng	Tom is probably going to be very tired when he gets home.

6431518	eng	Tom is probably going to be able to answer your question.
6431519	eng	Tom is likely going to be retired by this time next year.
6431520	eng	Tom is going to have plenty of time to do that next week.
6431521	eng	Tom is going to have a party at his place Monday evening.
6431522	eng	Tom is going to go back to Boston the day after tomorrow.
6431523	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for Mary in the lobby at 2:30.
6431524	eng	Tom is going to be staying here with us for three months.
6431525	eng	Tom is almost certainly going to be at the party tonight.
6431526	eng	Tom hoped that Mary wouldn't eat the last slice of pizza.
6431527	eng	Tom has been trying to figure out how to make Mary happy.
6431528	eng	Tom has been on vacation with his family for a few weeks.
6431529	eng	Tom encouraged Mary to go to Boston to visit her parents.
6431530	eng	Tom didn't know Mary had eaten the whole cake by herself.
6431531	eng	Tom convinced himself that he hadn't done anything wrong.
6431532	eng	Tom called his wife and told her he'd be late for dinner.
6431533	eng	Tom and Mary know John didn't eat breakfast this morning.
6431534	eng	Tom and Mary have been dating off and on for three years.
6431535	eng	The store you're talking about is located on Park Street.
6431536	eng	Please buy a couple of bottles of red wine for the party.
6431537	eng	It's going to be easy to find someone to do that for you.
6431538	eng	I've only met Mary once, but she seemed like a nice girl.
6431539	eng	I'm the one who convinced Tom to teach Mary how to drive.
6431540	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what Tom's phone number is.
6431541	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't like Mary.
6431542	eng	I heard that Tom will play tennis with us this afternoon.
6431543	eng	I haven't seen Tom since we were in high school together.
6431544	eng	I ended up telling Tom what Mary told me not to tell him.
6431545	eng	I don't like lying, but sometimes I think it's necessary.
6431546	eng	I didn't realize that Tom wanted me to do that with Mary.
6431547	eng	How much money do you estimate will be needed to do that?
6431548	eng	How much money do you estimate it'll take you to do that?
6431549	eng	How long do you think it would take me to read this book?
6431550	eng	Do you think Tom will be able to teach Mary how to drive?
6431551	eng	Do you really think Tom would forget something like that?
6431552	eng	Did you know that both Tom and Mary don't like chocolate?
6431553	eng	At the end of the 2013 season, Tom retired from football.
6431554	eng	Apparently, that's the only way Tom knows how to do that.
6431555	eng	You don't need to buy any sugar. We already have plenty.
6431556	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what the problem is?
6431557	eng	Where were you on October 20th at 2:30 in the afternoon?
6431558	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he started laughing.
6431559	eng	We've been waiting for you to tell us what we should do.
6431560	eng	Tom, Mary and John all live with their father in Boston.
6431561	eng	Tom works from early in the morning until late at night.
6431562	eng	Tom will hurt himself if he's not a little more careful.
6431563	eng	Tom walked into the room, carrying a bouquet of flowers.
6431564	eng	Tom used to hang up the laundry, but he doesn't anymore.
6431565	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't know how to eat with chopsticks.
6431566	eng	Tom thought Mary had lied to him about where she'd been.
6431567	eng	Tom says he thinks Mary ate dinner with John last night.

6431586	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
6431587	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be permitted to do that.
6431588	eng	Tom often sleeps on the train on his way home from work.
6431589	eng	Tom knew that Mary would be difficult to get along with.
6431590	eng	Tom is probably going to still be in Boston next Monday.
6431591	eng	Tom is probably going to get back from Boston on Monday.
6431592	eng	Tom is probably going to finish what he's doing by 2:30.
6431593	eng	Tom is most likely going to be the first one to show up.
6431594	eng	Tom is likely going to only sleep for about three hours.
6431595	eng	Tom is likely going to be very hungry when he gets home.

6431613	eng	On my days off, I often sit in the park and read a book.
6431614	eng	Mary is one of the most beautiful girls I have ever met.
6431615	eng	Mary is a good-looking girl, but she's not too friendly.
6431616	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for you to do that.
6431617	eng	It's probably going to be impossible for Tom to do that.
6431618	eng	It's going to take some time to get used to living here.
6431619	eng	It's going to take me a long time to get over this cold.
6431620	eng	It's going to be impossible to do that, don't you think?
6431621	eng	It's going to be impossible for Tom to do that tomorrow.
6431622	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't see Mary kissing John.
6431623	eng	If you ask Tom to lend you some money, he probably will.
6431624	eng	I'd rather not lie to my parents about where we've been.
6431625	eng	I was waiting for you to tell me what needed to be done.
6431626	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom hang out with Mary anymore.
6431627	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure I want to marry him.
6431628	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that for Mary.
6431629	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to go to Boston with Mary.

6431680	eng	Tom is probably going to be late for work this morning.
6431681	eng	Tom is probably going to be exhausted after doing that.
6431682	eng	Tom is never going to have to worry about going hungry.
6431683	eng	Tom is looking forward to spending some time with Mary.
6431684	eng	Tom is hoping Mary won't eat the rest of the ice cream.
6431685	eng	Tom is going to try to finish writing the report today.
6431686	eng	Tom is going to take a walk in the park this afternoon.
6431687	eng	Tom is going to be out of the office until next Monday.
6431688	eng	Tom is going to be making more money than me this year.
6431689	eng	Tom has three children at home and one away at college.
6431690	eng	Tom has been Mary's next-door neighbor for three years.
6431691	eng	Tom has always had a problem with knowing when to stop.
6431692	eng	Tom gave me his notebook with all his favorite recipes.
6431693	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to and from work.
6431694	eng	Tom doesn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431695	eng	Tom doesn't like it when his wife kisses him in public.
6431696	eng	Tom asked Mary why she had to eat dinner with her boss.
6431697	eng	Tom and Mary spent all morning discussing that problem.
6431698	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends I can talk to.
6431699	eng	Not only does Tom speak French, he also speaks English.
6431700	eng	My parents weren't the ones who taught me how to drive.
6431701	eng	My guess is that Tom won't do what you asked him to do.
6431702	eng	Mary shaves her legs more often than Alice shaves hers.
6431703	eng	Mary and her boyfriend were here together this morning.
6431704	eng	It's going to take you at least three hours to do that.
6431705	eng	It's going to take us several weeks to finish this job.
6431706	eng	It's going to take three hours to finish these repairs.
6431707	eng	It's going to cost you a lot to furnish your apartment.
6431708	eng	If something seems too good to be true, it probably is.
6431709	eng	I've only met Tom once, but she seemed like a nice guy.
6431710	eng	I'd grateful to you if you could teach me how to drive.
6431711	eng	I want to know if you know who broke my kitchen window.
6431712	eng	I used to see Tom jogging past my house in the morning.
6431713	eng	I thought flying to Boston would cost more than it did.
6431714	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you won't do that.
6431715	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you can't do that.
6431716	eng	I swore I'd never kiss Tom, but I ended up kissing him.
6431717	eng	I just don't know why Tom doesn't want me to help Mary.
6431718	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary have ever kissed each other.
6431719	eng	How much would you be willing to pay for me to do that?
6431720	eng	How long did it take you to finish writing this report?
6431721	eng	All the boys in Mary's class wanted to go out with her.
6431722	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him that you miss him?
6431723	eng	Why are you always so interested in what Tom is doing?
6431724	eng	While Tom was having a good time, Mary stayed at home.
6431725	eng	What Tom really needs now is a little time by himself.
6431726	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that today if he didn't have to.
6431727	eng	Tom works for a company that sells building materials.
6431728	eng	Tom won't be able to buy everything he needs for $300.
6431729	eng	Tom went to Mary's house to play video games with her.
6431730	eng	Tom wasn't able to help us today, because he was busy.
6431731	eng	Tom was looking forward to spending the day with Mary.
6431732	eng	Tom told me that he wanted to buy a necklace for Mary.
6431733	eng	Tom told me that Mary said she was sick of doing that.
6431734	eng	Tom told me he wanted to buy a couple of loaves bread.
6431735	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd eat anything she made for him.
6431736	eng	Tom told Mary that he had to eat dinner with his boss.
6431737	eng	Tom suggested that I read the contract very carefully.
6431738	eng	Tom spent the money Mary gave him on something to eat.
6431739	eng	Tom says that Mary will eat lunch with John and Alice.
6431740	eng	Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for Mary.
6431741	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary won't eat all the potato chips.
6431742	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very sorry for what he'd done.
6431743	eng	Tom said that he wasn't very interested in doing that.
6431744	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that we could be there.
6431745	eng	Tom said that he was very glad that he didn't do that.
6431746	eng	Tom said that he was certain that Mary had to do that.
6431747	eng	Tom said that he didn't think Mary could speak French.
6431748	eng	Tom said that Mary wouldn't likely do that by herself.
6431749	eng	Tom said that Mary would likely be willing to help us.
6431750	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't likely ready to do that yet.
6431751	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't at this afternoon's meeting.
6431752	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still studying French.
6431753	eng	Tom said that Mary was pretty good at speaking French.
6431754	eng	Tom said that Mary was going to go see John in Boston.
6431755	eng	Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
6431756	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't be doing that today.
6431757	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be hesitant to do that.
6431758	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the first one to do that.
6431759	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in doing that.
6431760	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
6431761	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was in her office on Mondays.
6431762	eng	Tom said he thought I might want to do that by myself.
6431763	eng	Tom said he thought I might not need to do that today.
6431764	eng	Tom said he thought I might not have to do that today.
6431765	eng	Tom said he thought I might not be allowed to do that.
6431766	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that this week.
6431767	eng	Tom said he thought I might need to do that by myself.
6431768	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that this week.
6431769	eng	Tom said he thought I might have to do that by myself.
6431770	eng	Tom said he hoped Mary would be able to help us today.
6431771	eng	Tom knew that Mary was going to be at today's meeting.
6431772	eng	Tom knew that I'd be able to do that faster than Mary.
6431773	eng	Tom isn't the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6431774	eng	Tom is the only one who thinks that's going to happen.
6431775	eng	Tom is probably only going to sleep about three hours.
6431776	eng	Tom is probably going to get punished if he does that.
6431777	eng	Tom is probably going to get arrested if he does that.
6431778	eng	Tom is probably going to be starved when he gets home.
6431779	eng	Tom is never going to be able to do that without help.
6431780	eng	Tom is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.
6431781	eng	Tom is likely going to be finished doing that by 2:30.
6431782	eng	Tom is going to want to know more about what happened.
6431783	eng	Tom is going to graduate from high school this spring.
6431784	eng	Tom is going to be waiting for you when you get there.
6431785	eng	Tom is going to be staying at least until next Monday.

6431788	eng	Tom is going to be heading back to Boston after lunch.
6431789	eng	Tom is going to be arriving by train tomorrow evening.
6431790	eng	Tom is going to be able to solve the problem, I think.
6431791	eng	Tom hasn't even read the first page of the report yet.
6431792	eng	Tom has been talking to Mary for the past three hours.
6431793	eng	Tom gave me his notebook full of his favorite recipes.
6431794	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary will be coming in this morning.
6431795	eng	Tom didn't really know why Mary wanted him to do that.
6431796	eng	Tom bought an old bus and is using it as storage shed.
6431797	eng	Tom and Mary ended up falling in love with each other.
6431798	eng	Tom and Mary are likely never to see each other again.
6431799	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John when he was three years old.
6431800	eng	This is a picture of the guitar I bought last weekend.
6431801	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary wants to eat Thai food for lunch.
6431802	eng	Mary ran into one of her ex-boyfriends at Tom's party.
6431803	eng	Mary must've been very beautiful when she was younger.
6431804	eng	It's probably going to be possible for you to do that.
6431805	eng	It's probably going to be possible for Tom to do that.
6431806	eng	It's not going to be possible for us to do that today.
6431807	eng	It's going to take you at least three days to do that.
6431808	eng	It's going to take us at least three hours to do that.
6431809	eng	It's going to take me at least three hours to do that.
6431810	eng	It's going to take a lot of time to finish doing that.
6431811	eng	If the weather is good, let's walk to school tomorrow.
6431812	eng	I've been waiting for you to tell me what I should do.
6431813	eng	I'm farily certain that Tom wouldn't help you do that.
6431814	eng	I wouldn't have lied if Tom hadn't insisted that I do.
6431815	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that when he was in Boston.
6431816	eng	I wonder if Tom knows Mary ate both of his sandwiches.
6431817	eng	I think you need to tell Tom that you're in love Mary.
6431818	eng	I heard that both Tom and Mary don't know how to swim.
6431819	eng	I don't think we should ask Tom to pay for everything.
6431820	eng	I don't think Tom loves Mary as much as she loves him.
6431821	eng	I don't know what I can do to convince Tom to help us.
6431822	eng	How often do you give advice to people you don't know?
6431823	eng	How much time will it take you to hang up the laundry?
6431824	eng	How much time will it take Tom to hang up the laundry?
6431825	eng	How much money do you think will be needed to do that?
6431826	eng	How much money do you estimate you'll need to do that?
6431827	eng	How much does Tom get paid to babysit Mary's children?

6431833	eng	How long do you estimate it'll take to paint my house?
6431834	eng	Have you shown Tom the pictures you took last weekend?
6431835	eng	Has anything out of the ordinary happened here lately?
6431836	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you do that.
6431837	eng	All Tom wanted was to spend some time with his family.
6431838	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom that you didn't like him.
6431839	eng	You should've thought about that before you did that.
6431840	eng	Would you be able to come back here tomorrow at 2:30?
6431841	eng	Worrying about that's been keeping me awake at night.
6431842	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's happening?
6431843	eng	Tom would do practically anything to make Mary happy.
6431844	eng	Tom would do practically anything to keep Mary happy.
6431845	eng	Tom would do anything to get what he thinks he needs.
6431846	eng	Tom won't be able to buy what he needs at this store.
6431847	eng	Tom will be really tired when he gets home, won't he?
6431848	eng	Tom wasn't the only boy I kissed. I also kissed John.
6431849	eng	Tom used to make fun of Mary, but he doesn't anymore.
6431850	eng	Tom took care of Mary's cats while she was in Boston.
6431851	eng	Tom told Mary she should eat everything on her plate.
6431852	eng	Tom told Mary she had to eat everything on her plate.
6431853	eng	Tom told Mary he'd lied to her and that he was sorry.
6431854	eng	Tom thought the girl he saw talking to John was Mary.
6431855	eng	Tom says he has to find somebody to do that for Mary.
6431856	eng	Tom said that it looked like Mary was getting sleepy.
6431857	eng	Tom said that it looked like Mary was getting drowsy.
6431858	eng	Tom said that he wasn't sure that Mary would do that.

6431864	eng	Tom said that Mary would probably be able to do that.
6431865	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't sure what she needed to do.
6431866	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably too young to do that.
6431867	eng	Tom said that Mary was happy she was able to do that.
6431868	eng	Tom said that Mary has been to Australia three times.
6431869	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be having much fun.
6431870	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't eat both of her sandwiches.
6431871	eng	Tom said he thought he'd be able to find another job.
6431872	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be willing to do that.
6431873	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be tempted to do that.
6431874	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous doing that.
6431875	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be frightened by that.
6431876	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be at today's meeting.
6431877	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wasn't interested in sports.
6431878	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was the last one to do that.
6431879	eng	Tom said he thought Mary was outside waiting for you.

6431881	eng	Tom said he thought Mary might need to do that again.

6431884	eng	Tom said he didn't know where he should park his car.
6431885	eng	Tom said Mary would unlikely eat anything this spicy.
6431886	eng	Tom refused to tell me who gave him those binoculars.
6431887	eng	Tom ran to the bus stop, so he wouldn't miss the bus.
6431888	eng	Tom ran to the bus stop, but he still missed the bus.
6431889	eng	Tom knows Mary will probably be too busy to help him.
6431890	eng	Tom knew that Mary wouldn't eat the fish he'd caught.
6431891	eng	Tom knew that I was glad that that's going to happen.
6431892	eng	Tom is probably going to stay in Boston until Monday.
6431893	eng	Tom is probably going to have a good time doing that.

6431910	eng	Tom is going to go swimming with us tomorrow morning.

6431912	eng	Tom is going to figure out how to do that eventually.
6431913	eng	Tom is going to eventually figure out how to do that.
6431914	eng	Tom is going to come back and help us this afternoon.
6431915	eng	Tom is going to be thirsty when he finishes the race.
6431916	eng	Tom is going to be sleeping by the time we get there.
6431917	eng	Tom is going to be ready for us in about ten minutes.
6431918	eng	Tom is going to be mad at you if you keep doing that.
6431919	eng	Tom is going to be doing that early tomorrow morning.
6431920	eng	Tom is going to ask Mary to do that for us, isn't he?

6431933	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary will eat lunch with us tomorrow.
6431934	eng	Mary told Tom that John wasn't her boyfriend anymore.
6431935	eng	It's obvious that Tom and Mary don't like each other.
6431936	eng	It's going to take too much time for Tom to get here.
6431937	eng	It's going to take a long time for me to finish this.
6431938	eng	It's going to take Tom a couple of hours to get here.
6431939	eng	It's going to cost about thirty dollars to repair it.
6431940	eng	It's been a long time since I've been back to Boston.
6431941	eng	I'm scared to death right now, to be honest with you.
6431942	eng	I'm only telling you this because I'm your my friend.
6431943	eng	I think you should tell Tom that you don't like Mary.
6431944	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom go to Boston by himself.
6431945	eng	I think Tom kissed Mary for the first time yesterday.
6431946	eng	I think Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
6431947	eng	I haven't decided whether to go college or get a job.
6431948	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what happened.
6431949	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up anytime soon.
6431950	eng	I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
6431951	eng	I don't think Tom will want to go to Boston with you.
6431952	eng	How much time did it take you to hang up the laundry?

6431960	eng	Are you sure it was Tom who taught Mary how to drive?
6431961	eng	Apparently, Tom and Mary talked about that on Monday.
6431962	eng	"Is Mary your girlfriend?" "No, she's just a friend."
6431963	eng	You could've let me know you were going out tonight.
6431964	eng	Why don't you call Tom and tell him what's going on?
6431965	eng	Why don't you call Tom and invite him to your party?
6431966	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't live in Boston anymore?
6431967	eng	Who did Tom say was going to go to Boston with Mary?
6431968	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got jealous.
6431969	eng	When Tom got home, his children were already asleep.
6431970	eng	What do you think Tom will do now that he's retired?
6431971	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't need to.
6431972	eng	Tom wouldn't go back to Boston if he didn't have to.
6431973	eng	Tom works for a company that makes automobile parts.
6431974	eng	Tom wondered why Mary didn't eat her whole sandwich.
6431975	eng	Tom won't make you do anything you don't want to do.
6431976	eng	Tom won't be able to help us paint the garage today.
6431977	eng	Tom wasn't supposed to get any money for doing that.
6431978	eng	Tom was walking too fast for Mary catch up with him.
6431979	eng	Tom was supposed to babysit our children last night.
6431980	eng	Tom was afraid that he was about to lose everything.
6431981	eng	Tom wanted to practice French with a native speaker.
6431982	eng	Tom thought the boy he saw talking to Mary was John.
6431983	eng	Tom thought Mary was going to let him go home early.
6431984	eng	Tom thought Mary lied to him about where she'd been.
6431985	eng	Tom thinks that Mary will eat what he makes for her.
6431986	eng	Tom stole something from the store where Mary works.
6431987	eng	Tom says it doesn't matter to him if Mary does that.
6431988	eng	Tom says he needs the rest of the money you owe him.
6431989	eng	Tom says he has to find someone to do that for Mary.

6432049	eng	Tom and Mary ended up getting married to each other.
6432050	eng	Tom and Mary are sitting under that tree over there.
6432051	eng	There are lots of people who could help you do that.
6432052	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been accused of doing that.
6432053	eng	My parents wouldn't let me drive until I was twenty.
6432054	eng	Mary's husband was here a while ago looking for her.
6432055	eng	Mary is a nice girl, except that she talks too much.
6432056	eng	It's going to take me a good three hours to do that.
6432057	eng	It seems like I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6432058	eng	It seems like I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6432059	eng	It looks like I'm the only one who wants to do that.

6432061	eng	I'd be very surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6432062	eng	I wonder if you could tell me what needs to be done.
6432063	eng	I wonder if Tom really wants us to do that for Mary.
6432064	eng	I wish you hadn't lied to me about where you'd been.
6432065	eng	I wish I hadn't asked Tom to teach you how to drive.
6432066	eng	I understand French, but I can't speak it very well.
6432067	eng	I thought Tom would apologize to Mary, but he didn't
6432068	eng	I thought Tom knew why we couldn't do that for Mary.
6432069	eng	I think you should tell Tom why you don't like Mary.
6432070	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom play with Mary anymore.
6432071	eng	I think that Tom lied to you about when he did that.
6432072	eng	I think Tom will do the same thing he did yesterday.
6432073	eng	I still drive that old truck my grandfather gave me.
6432074	eng	I really like Tom, but I'm not sure that I love him.
6432075	eng	I know Tom is in the hospital, but I don't know why.
6432076	eng	I interviewed Tom Jackson on October 20th in Boston.
6432077	eng	I don't think Tom likes you as much as you like him.

6432079	eng	How much money do you spend on groceries every week?
6432080	eng	How many weeks do you think Tom will stay in Boston?
6432081	eng	How many days did it take you to paint that picture?
6432082	eng	How many days did it take Tom to paint this picture?
6432083	eng	Go wake Tom up and tell him that breakfast is ready.
6432084	eng	You promised me you'd look after the kids tomorrow.
6432085	eng	You could've let me know you were going to be late.
6432086	eng	Who did Tom think would want to go there with Mary?
6432087	eng	We won't be able to do that if Tom doesn't help us.
6432088	eng	We need to find out where Tom wants us to meet him.
6432089	eng	We need to buy another file cabinet for the office.
6432090	eng	Tom wouldn't tell me who gave him those binoculars.
6432091	eng	Tom wouldn't let his children speak French at home.

6432146	eng	Tom overheard what was being said in the next room.
6432147	eng	Tom needs to stay in bed if he wants to recuperate.
6432148	eng	Tom might've lied about who he went to Boston with.

6432154	eng	Tom isn't the only one who doesn't need to do that.

6432156	eng	Tom isn't as motivated to do that as he used to be.
6432157	eng	Tom isn't as desperate to do that as he used to be.
6432158	eng	Tom is worried that something might happen to Mary.
6432159	eng	Tom is the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
6432160	eng	Tom is probably going to get fined if he does that.

6432162	eng	Tom is never going to permit Mary to do that again.
6432163	eng	Tom is never going to find out about what happened.

6432190	eng	Tom and Mary have known each other for three years.
6432191	eng	Tom and I haven't kissed each other in a long time.
6432192	eng	The restaurant we went to yesterday was quite good.
6432193	eng	The only thing Tom ever gave me was his old jacket.
6432194	eng	Someone who knows French well must've written this.
6432195	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends in Boston.
6432196	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I need to do that.
6432197	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has told me I have to do that.

6432208	eng	Mary refused to accept the roses that Tom sent her.
6432209	eng	Mary knew she wasn't the first girl Tom had kissed.
6432210	eng	Mary is depressed because her husband has left her.

6432212	eng	It's probably going to be tough for you to do that.

6432214	eng	It's probably going to be risky for you to do that.
6432215	eng	It's probably going to be risky for Tom to do that.

6432217	eng	It's going to take three hours to make the changes.
6432218	eng	It's going to take me about three hours to do that.
6432219	eng	It's going to be dark by the time we get to Boston.
6432220	eng	It looks like Tom has fallen down and hurt himself.
6432221	eng	It doesn't matter to me whether you do that or not.
6432222	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you've done for Mary.
6432223	eng	I'd grateful to you if you could teach me to drive.
6432224	eng	I would've let Tom drive if I'd known he wanted to.
6432225	eng	I wonder why Tom lied to us about when he did that.
6432226	eng	I wish I could do that with you today, but I can't.
6432227	eng	I thought Tom was going to buy some blankets today.
6432228	eng	I think Tom would do anything to get what he wants.
6432229	eng	I ran into some of my friends at the train station.
6432230	eng	I hope you haven't forgotten about today's meeting.
6432231	eng	I don't think we should tell Tom about what we did.
6432232	eng	I don't think these are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6432233	eng	I didn't think it was a good idea to let Tom drive.
6432234	eng	How much money do you think you'll need to do that?
6432235	eng	How many hours do you think it took Tom to do that?
6432236	eng	Even though it was raining, we went out for a walk.
6432237	eng	Almost all of Tom's ex-wives are friends with Mary.
6432238	eng	You said Tom wouldn't kiss me, but you were wrong.
6432239	eng	You haven't forgotten about the meeting, have you?
6432240	eng	Would you like to go and see a movie this evening?
6432241	eng	When Tom saw Mary and John together, he got angry.
6432242	eng	Tom would've been here if he knew he needed to be.
6432243	eng	Tom will be waiting for Mary in the lobby at 2:30.
6432244	eng	Tom went out drinking with his friends last night.
6432245	eng	Tom wasn't the person Mary wanted to do that with.
6432246	eng	Tom wasn't the only person Mary wanted to talk to.
6432247	eng	Tom wasn't the only person Mary needed to talk to.

6432267	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still in her room.
6432268	eng	Tom said that Mary said she's seen people do that.
6432269	eng	Tom said that Mary looked like she was having fun.

6432994	eng	This bicycle didn't cost as much as I expected.
6432995	eng	There's no room for anything else in my closet.

6433042	eng	It's probably going to be expensive to do that.
6433043	eng	It's probably going to be dangerous to do that.
6433044	eng	It's going to take me several hours to do that.
6433045	eng	It's going to cause me problems if you do that.
6433046	eng	It's going to be easier if we do that together.
6433047	eng	It's going to be done by the time you get here.
6433048	eng	It's been years since I've been back to Boston.
6433049	eng	It would be nice if we could go there together.
6433050	eng	It seems I'm the only one who wants to do that.
6433051	eng	It seems I'm the only one who needs to do that.
6433052	eng	I'm very sure that Tom won't help Mary do that.
6433053	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for Mary.
6433054	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom didn't let you do that.
6433055	eng	I would strongly advise you to stop doing that.
6433056	eng	I was born in Boston, but I grew up in Chicago.
6433057	eng	I think the whole thing was a misunderstanding.
6433058	eng	I think that Tom lied to you about what he did.
6433059	eng	I think Tom would like you to do that for Mary.
6433060	eng	I think Tom would like Mary to do that for him.
6433061	eng	I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
6433062	eng	I think Tom didn't understand your explanation.
6433063	eng	I think Tom couldn't hear what you were saying.
6433064	eng	I think Mary would like Tom to do that for her.
6433065	eng	I still watch TV, but not as much as I used to.
6433066	eng	I still have the same questions I asked before.
6433067	eng	I have visited Tom a number of times in Boston.
6433068	eng	I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
6433069	eng	I don't think Tom was expecting you to do that.
6433070	eng	I don't have many friends who can speak French.
6433071	eng	I didn't think you were going to let Tom drive.
6433072	eng	I can show you around town if you'd like me to.
6433073	eng	How often does Tom wear that tie Mary gave him?
6433074	eng	How much would you pay for something like that?
6433075	eng	How much would you charge me to paint my house?
6433076	eng	How much severance pay will we have to pay Tom?
6433077	eng	How much of what Tom said do you think is true?
6433078	eng	How much of a discount do you think we can get?
6433079	eng	How much money do you think Tom spends a month?
6433080	eng	How much do you usually spend when you eat out?
6433081	eng	How many hours has Tom been helping you so far?
6433082	eng	How long would it take to get to Boston by bus?
6433083	eng	How did you know Tom would refuse to kiss Mary?
6433084	eng	How did you know Tom wasn't going to kiss Mary?
6433085	eng	Have you ever been to Chuck's Diner for brunch?
6433086	eng	Either Tom doesn't want to do that or he can't.
6433087	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you help Mary?
6433088	eng	Could what happened in Boston also happen here?
6433089	eng	As far as I know, Tom has never studied French.
6433090	eng	As far as I know, Tom has never been to Boston.
6433091	eng	Aren't you the one who taught Tom how to drive?
6433092	eng	Are you sure that Tom was the one who did that?
6433093	eng	A girl named Mary said she was looking for you.
6433094	eng	Your French isn't good enough to get that job.
6433095	eng	You'd really better stop doing that right now.
6433096	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about what we did.
6433097	eng	Wouldn't it be better for us to do that today?
6433098	eng	When was the last time you saw Tom doing that?
6433099	eng	When was the last time Tom ate lunch with you?
6433100	eng	When do you think Tom will want us to do that?
6433101	eng	When Tom heard about what happened, he smiled.
6433102	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a teenager.
6433103	eng	What's the best way to get downtown from here?
6433104	eng	What time do you usually get home from school?
6433105	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to donate money?
6433106	eng	Tom wouldn't let anybody do anything for Mary.
6433107	eng	Tom won't find anyone who'll do that for Mary.
6433108	eng	Tom will try to talk to Mary about that today.
6433109	eng	Tom will show us the documents this afternoon.
6433110	eng	Tom will definitely not allow Mary to do that.
6433111	eng	Tom will come back and help us this afternoon.
6433112	eng	Tom will be very disappointed if that happens.
6433113	eng	Tom will ask Mary if she can help us tomorrow.
6433114	eng	Tom wasn't the one who taught me how to drive.
6433115	eng	Tom wasn't the first man Mary wanted to marry.
6433116	eng	Tom was afraid to go into the cave by himself.
6433117	eng	Tom wanted to know who was going to help Mary.
6433118	eng	Tom told us he wouldn't come back before 2:30.
6433119	eng	Tom told me he isn't going to do that anymore.
6433120	eng	Tom told Mary not to kiss him in public again.
6433121	eng	Tom told Mary about what had happened at work.
6433122	eng	Tom told Mary about what John asked him to do.
6433123	eng	Tom thought Mary was going to do that for him.
6433124	eng	Tom spoke with Mary on the phone this morning.
6433125	eng	Tom spent a lot of time with Mary last summer.
6433126	eng	Tom showed us that it was possible to do that.
6433127	eng	Tom should tell Mary not to eat those berries.
6433128	eng	Tom says that he walked three miles yesterday.
6433129	eng	Tom says that he needs a better tennis racket.
6433130	eng	Tom says he'll buy a painting from Mary today.
6433131	eng	Tom says he'll ask Mary to eat lunch with him.
6433132	eng	Tom said that he'd be the next one to do that.
6433133	eng	Tom said that he was very hesitant to do that.
6433134	eng	Tom said that he was the first one to do that.
6433135	eng	Tom said that he was interested in doing that.
6433136	eng	Tom said that Mary was probably still outside.

6433139	eng	Tom said that Mary should eat more vegetables.
6433140	eng	Tom said that Mary looked like she was sleepy.
6433141	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be prepared.
6433142	eng	Tom said that Mary didn't seem to be confused.
6433143	eng	Tom said he's glad that you did that for Mary.
6433144	eng	Tom said he'd try to convince Mary to do that.
6433145	eng	Tom said he wished you would do that for Mary.
6433146	eng	Tom said he wasn't going to sign the contract.
6433147	eng	Tom said he wanted Mary to eat lunch with him.
6433148	eng	Tom said he understood what needed to be done.
6433149	eng	Tom said he thought that would embarrass Mary.
6433150	eng	Tom said he thought that he might be able win.
6433151	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would likely not win.
6433152	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would likely not cry.
6433153	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would likely do that.

6433165	eng	Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
6433166	eng	Tom never expected Mary to eat all the donuts.
6433167	eng	Tom needs to go back home to get his passport.
6433168	eng	Tom let Mary know he didn't know how to drive.
6433169	eng	Tom left his suitcase in the trunk of his car.
6433170	eng	Tom knows who Mary hopes asks her to the prom.
6433171	eng	Tom knew that something terrible had happened.
6433172	eng	Tom isn't the only person Mary should talk to.
6433173	eng	Tom is still just a kid, so let's forgive him.
6433174	eng	Tom is probably going to volunteer to do that.
6433175	eng	Tom is probably going to tell Mary he's tired.

6433186	eng	Tom is likely going to be doing that tomorrow.

6433188	eng	Tom is going to try to find out why Mary left.
6433189	eng	Tom is going to try to do that sometime today.

6433213	eng	Tom has been staying at a hotel near my house.
6433214	eng	Tom has been practicing the piano all morning.

6433216	eng	Tom has been down in the basement all morning.
6433217	eng	Tom has been Mary's boyfriend for a long time.
6433218	eng	Tom hardly ever spends time with his children.
6433219	eng	Tom got here about fifteen minutes after Mary.
6433220	eng	Tom drove to the hospital as fast as he could.
6433221	eng	Tom drives by Mary's house on his way to work.
6433222	eng	Tom doesn't understand why Mary acts that way.
6433223	eng	Tom doesn't often talk about his private life.
6433224	eng	Tom didn't really seem to be enjoying himself.
6433225	eng	Tom could've been there, but I didn't see him.
6433226	eng	Tom carefully planned what he was going to do.
6433227	eng	Tom asked Mary to lie about where they'd been.
6433228	eng	Tom apparently wants to go to Boston with you.
6433229	eng	Tom and Mary were alone together on the porch.
6433230	eng	Tom and Mary don't usually eat out on Mondays.
6433231	eng	There are lots of people who wouldn't do that.
6433232	eng	Other than you, I don't have any friends here.
6433233	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is skating.
6433234	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is fishing.
6433235	eng	One of Tom's favorite things to do is camping.
6433236	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has the right to do that.
6433237	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been told to do that.
6433238	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want to go with us.
6433239	eng	Mary's oldest son looks just like her husband.
6433240	eng	Mary's husband died three hours after she did.
6433241	eng	Mary's boyfriend is a lot younger than she is.
6433242	eng	Mary told Tom not to kiss her in public again.
6433243	eng	Mary told Tom about what John asked her to do.
6433244	eng	Mary thought Tom was going to do that for her.
6433245	eng	Mary never told us that Tom was her boyfriend.
6433246	eng	Mary dated Tom's brother before she dated him.
6433247	eng	Mary asked Tom to pretend to be her boyfriend.
6433248	eng	It's probably going to be easy for Tom to win.
6433249	eng	It's going to take Tom a long time to do that.
6433250	eng	It's going to be almost impossible to do that.
6433251	eng	It's been three weeks since Tom has been here.
6433252	eng	It's a good thing that you did that yesterday.
6433253	eng	It's a good thing that Tom did that yesterday.
6433254	eng	It'll take us at least three hours to do that.
6433255	eng	It looks as if Tom won't go to Boston with us.
6433256	eng	In October of 2013, Tom retired from coaching.
6433257	eng	In 2013, Tom retired from professional tennis.
6433258	eng	In 2013, Tom married Mary and moved to Boston.
6433259	eng	If Tom goes to the zoo with you, I'll go, too.
6433260	eng	I'm sure Tom will be hungry when he gets home.
6433261	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates what you do for Mary.
6433262	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciated what you did for him.
6433263	eng	I'm not going to let Tom drive my car anymore.
6433264	eng	I'm glad you're coming to visit us next month.
6433265	eng	I'm fairly certain that's not going to happen.
6433266	eng	I wouldn't have let Tom drive if I'd been you.
6433267	eng	I wouldn't be able to do that even if I tried.
6433268	eng	I wonder what Tom will do with all that money.
6433269	eng	I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
6433270	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to come here tomorrow.
6433271	eng	I thought you said you wouldn't let Tom drive.
6433272	eng	I think you need to stop doing that right now.
6433273	eng	I think Tom knows he needs to help Mary today.
6433274	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to get here earlier.
6433275	eng	I still wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6433276	eng	I often recommend your website to my students.
6433277	eng	I never even got to tell Tom that I loved him.
6433278	eng	I hope Tom doesn't think we've forgotten Mary.
6433279	eng	I don't think Tom would like it if I did that.
6433280	eng	I don't think Tom will study French next year.
6433281	eng	I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
6433282	eng	I don't think Tom is going to let you do that.
6433283	eng	I don't know where Tom will be this afternoon.
6433284	eng	I didn't know you were going to let Tom drive.
6433285	eng	I didn't know Tom was going to let Mary drive.
6433286	eng	How much of a discount do you think I can get?
6433287	eng	How much fun do you think Tom's party will be?
6433288	eng	How many pictures have you taken so far today?
6433289	eng	How many patients did Dr. Jackson treat today?
6433290	eng	How long does it usually take to rotate tires?
6433291	eng	How did Tom react when he saw Mary doing that?
6433292	eng	Give me one good reason why I should help you.
6433293	eng	Don't think that I'm going to let you do that.
6433294	eng	Don't put your books on the dining room table.
6433295	eng	Don't forget that you need to buy some onions.
6433296	eng	Do you think we should take umbrellas with us?
6433297	eng	Do you really think Tom will be here tomorrow?
6433298	eng	All the boys in Mary's class think she's cute.
6433299	eng	You should let Tom know that you can't drive.
6433300	eng	You should let Tom know that Mary will drive.
6433301	eng	You should get Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433302	eng	You should ask Tom to teach you how to drive.
6433303	eng	You don't really need to lose weight, do you?
6433304	eng	You don't know when Tom will do that, do you?
6433305	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't do that anymore?
6433306	eng	Why are you glad that that's going to happen?
6433307	eng	When I first met Tom, he was still a student.
6433308	eng	What Tom wanted was to another piece of cake.
6433309	eng	We didn't know whether Tom was dead or alive.

6433322	eng	Tom wanted to know what had happened to Mary.
6433323	eng	Tom tried to get Mary to cook dinner for him.
6433324	eng	Tom told me the boy talking to Mary was John.
6433325	eng	Tom told me he wouldn't be home this weekend.
6433326	eng	Tom told me he wanted me to do that for Mary.
6433327	eng	Tom told Mary to eat everything on her plate.
6433328	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want anything to eat.
6433329	eng	Tom told Mary about what John told him to do.
6433330	eng	Tom thinks Mary is probably in the cafeteria.
6433331	eng	Tom swore that Mary told him she'd done that.

6433340	eng	Tom said that he was very anxious to do that.
6433341	eng	Tom said that he was the last one to do that.
6433342	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary would be early.
6433343	eng	Tom said that Mary was very unlikely do that.
6433344	eng	Tom said that Mary was too stupid to do that.
6433345	eng	Tom said that Mary was too sleepy to do that.

6433360	eng	Tom said that Mary had to do that by herself.
6433361	eng	Tom said he's not looking for a relationship.
6433362	eng	Tom said he'd ask Mary to eat lunch with him.

6433366	eng	Tom said he thought that Mary was having fun.
6433367	eng	Tom said he thought that John was Mary's son.

6433371	eng	Tom said he thought Mary would be doing that.

6433375	eng	Tom said Mary is going to eat dinner with us.

6433466	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has asked us to do that.

6433468	eng	My favorite flavor of ice cream is chocolate.
6433469	eng	Maybe Tom would like you to do that for Mary.
6433470	eng	Maybe Tom will get into to Harvard in Boston.
6433471	eng	Mary's husband is just as stubborn as she is.
6433472	eng	Mary said she didn't know who Tom's wife was.
6433473	eng	Mary doesn't ever kiss her husband in public.
6433474	eng	Mary came to visit us with her new boyfriend.
6433475	eng	It's quite unlikely Tom will want to do that.
6433476	eng	It's going to take us a long time to do that.
6433477	eng	It's going to take time to work through that.
6433478	eng	It's going to take me a long time to do that.
6433479	eng	It's going to take approximately three hours.
6433480	eng	It's going to be dark by the time I get home.
6433481	eng	It seems I'm the only one who has to do that.
6433482	eng	It looks like Tom won't go to Boston with us.
6433483	eng	I've never seen Tom kiss any of his children.
6433484	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if we stayed here.
6433485	eng	I'm sure Tom will be tired when he gets home.
6433486	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom won't be at Mary's party.
6433487	eng	I'm absolutely positive that Tom can do that.
6433488	eng	I wouldn't be able to go even if I wanted to.
6433489	eng	I wonder which bicycles are Tom's and Mary's.
6433490	eng	I wasn't the one who taught Tom how to drive.
6433491	eng	I wanted to kiss Tom yesterday, but I didn't.
6433492	eng	I thought you said you'd never let Tom drive.
6433493	eng	I thought Tom said that Mary was from Boston.
6433494	eng	I thought Tom said he needed to buy a shovel.
6433495	eng	I think you should stop doing that right now.
6433496	eng	I think Tom will do that in Boston next week.
6433497	eng	I think Tom will be hungry when he gets home.
6433498	eng	I think Tom needs to talk to Mary personally.
6433499	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to ask him to stay.
6433500	eng	I ran into some friends at the train station.
6433501	eng	I never thought I'd run into Tom in the park.
6433502	eng	I know Tom wants us to go swimming with Mary.
6433503	eng	I knew that Tom wouldn't kiss Mary goodnight.
6433504	eng	I just hope Tom does what we asked him to do.
6433505	eng	I first met Tom at a football game in Boston.
6433506	eng	I don't think that Tom would ever leave Mary.
6433507	eng	I don't think Tom should've let Mary do that.
6433508	eng	I don't know who kissed Tom and I don't care.
6433509	eng	I don't know how Tom did that, but he did it.
6433510	eng	I don't hug my children as often as I should.
6433511	eng	I convinced Tom to lie about where he'd been.
6433512	eng	I can show you around town if you want me to.
6433513	eng	I bought these flowers for Mary, not for you.
6433514	eng	How many times a day do you check your email?
6433515	eng	How many more months will Tom stay in Boston?
6433516	eng	How long will it take you to clean your room?
6433517	eng	How long does Tom expect us to wait for Mary?
6433518	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French before?
6433519	eng	Dr. Jackson doesn't have any female patients.
6433520	eng	Does Tom think really Mary enjoys doing that?
6433521	eng	Do you think you could persuade Tom to drive?
6433522	eng	Do you think Tom would teach me how to drive?
6433523	eng	Do you really think Tom will help us do that?
6433524	eng	Did you do anything interesting last weekend?
6433525	eng	Did Tom say anything about who was with Mary?
6433526	eng	Did Tom say anything about who Mary was with?
6433527	eng	Did Tom actually see Mary eating my sandwich?
6433528	eng	Could what happened to Tom also happen to us?
6433529	eng	Ask Tom if Mary will eat lunch with us today.
6433530	eng	Are you sure you don't mind me tagging along?
6433531	eng	Are you going to tell Tom that you love Mary?
6433532	eng	Would you like me to teach you how to drive?
6433533	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom was born?
6433534	eng	Why is Tom glad that that's going to happen?
6433535	eng	What have you accomplished so far this week?
6433536	eng	What I'd really like is a hot cup of coffee.
6433537	eng	We're getting the results that we hoped for.
6433538	eng	Was Tom the one who taught you how to drive?
6433539	eng	Tom's oldest daughter looks a lot like Mary.
6433540	eng	Tom wouldn't lend Mary the books she wanted.
6433541	eng	Tom works for a company that sells charcoal.
6433542	eng	Tom wondered why Mary was eating by herself.
6433543	eng	Tom won't likely be able to help Mary today.

6433546	eng	Tom was wearing a cowboy hat when I saw him.
6433547	eng	Tom was waiting for Mary in the parking lot.
6433548	eng	Tom was the last one to leave the classroom.
6433549	eng	Tom was supposed to get paid for doing that.
6433550	eng	Tom was fined for driving without a license.
6433551	eng	Tom wanted to remind Mary about the meeting.
6433552	eng	Tom very seldom kisses his children anymore.
6433553	eng	Tom told us about how nice you were to Mary.
6433554	eng	Tom told me that he was going to marry Mary.
6433555	eng	Tom told me he'd be glad to help me do that.
6433556	eng	Tom told me he needed to buy some new tools.
6433557	eng	Tom told Mary that he'd eat lunch with John.
6433558	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't know how to do that.

6434024	eng	The doctor says that Tom will be all right.
6434025	eng	The children want you to read them a story.
6434026	eng	Tell Tom that we're not going to help Mary.
6434027	eng	Something really should be done about that.
6434028	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has agreed to do that.
6434029	eng	My favorite kind of ice cream is chocolate.

6434062	eng	It's going to take us hours to finish this.
6434063	eng	It's going to stop snowing sooner or later.
6434064	eng	It's going to cost you more to go by plane.
6434065	eng	It's going to cost at least thirty dollars.
6434066	eng	It's been a while since I've talked to Tom.
6434067	eng	It might be a good idea to stop doing that.
6434068	eng	Is Tom the one who taught you how to drive?
6434069	eng	I've finished reading the book you lent me.
6434070	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434071	eng	I'm sorry I'm late. My alarm didn't go off.
6434072	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't be interested.
6434073	eng	I'm going to buy myself a birthday present.
6434074	eng	I'm absolutely positive that I can do that.
6434075	eng	I'd rather not kiss Tom if I don't have to.
6434076	eng	I wonder if that'll happen in our lifetimes
6434077	eng	I wish you'd stop lying to us all the time.
6434078	eng	I wish I could help you today, but I can't.

6434081	eng	I want to know if you know where Tom lives.
6434082	eng	I want to know if Tom knows how to do that.

6434084	eng	I told Tom he could buy whatever he wanted.
6434085	eng	I told Tom he could buy anything he wanted.
6434086	eng	I thought I saw Tom kissing Mary yesterday.
6434087	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom drive anymore.
6434088	eng	I think we all know that that's a bad idea.
6434089	eng	I think Tom won't stop crying anytime soon.
6434090	eng	I think Tom said that Mary was from Boston.
6434091	eng	I think Tom said he needed to buy a shovel.
6434092	eng	I spend a lot of time doing things for Tom.
6434093	eng	I sang in the church choir for three years.
6434094	eng	I intend to lie to Tom about what happened.
6434095	eng	I don't think you should be doing that now.
6434096	eng	I don't think this is exactly what we need.
6434097	eng	I don't think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6434098	eng	I don't think Tom would ever do that again.
6434099	eng	I don't think Tom would be able to help us.
6434100	eng	I don't think Mary would leave her husband.
6434101	eng	I didn't let Tom talk me into helping Mary.
6434102	eng	I didn't allow Tom do what he wanted to do.
6434103	eng	I did know that Tom used to live in Boston.
6434104	eng	How much sugar should I put in your coffee?
6434105	eng	How much more work do you have to do today?
6434106	eng	How much more weight does Tom want to lose?

6434111	eng	How long did it take Tom to get here today?
6434112	eng	How did Tom get Mary to eat her vegetables?
6434113	eng	Eventually Tom purchased a house in Boston.
6434114	eng	Do you really think Tom will let you drive?
6434115	eng	Could you please be quiet? Tom is sleeping.
6434116	eng	Are you still working for the same company?
6434117	eng	Are you going to take an umbrella with you?
6434118	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "In the garden."
6434119	eng	You should've asked me to do that for you.
6434120	eng	You said Tom wouldn't kiss me, but he did.
6434121	eng	Would you happen to know why Tom was late?
6434122	eng	Where do you think Tom will go to college?
6434123	eng	When was the last time Tom came to Boston?
6434124	eng	When and where did you and Tom first kiss?
6434125	eng	Were you able to persuade Tom to help you?
6434126	eng	We still don't know what Tom will do next.
6434127	eng	We shouldn't tell Tom about what happened.
6434128	eng	Tom's family lived in Boston at that time.
6434129	eng	Tom wouldn't likely go camping by himself.
6434130	eng	Tom wouldn't let you go there by yourself.
6434131	eng	Tom works for a company that sells bricks.
6434132	eng	Tom won't be very happy if Mary does that.
6434133	eng	Tom will try to convince you to help Mary.

6434333	eng	Tom doesn't understand why Mary does that.
6434334	eng	Tom doesn't know who's going to help Mary.
6434335	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to eat so much candy.
6434336	eng	Tom didn't think Mary would let him drive.
6434337	eng	Tom didn't say where or when to meet Mary.
6434338	eng	Tom didn't really expect to find anything.
6434339	eng	Tom didn't read the message Mary sent him.
6434340	eng	Tom didn't know what was likely to happen?
6434341	eng	Tom didn't have time to go shopping today.
6434342	eng	Tom didn't get home until late last night.
6434343	eng	Tom didn't expect you to do that for Mary.
6434344	eng	Tom couldn't find his way out of the cave.
6434345	eng	Tom couldn't come today because he's sick.
6434346	eng	Tom could probably teach you how to drive.
6434347	eng	Tom convinced Mary to make him a sandwich.
6434348	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach John how to drive.
6434349	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the park with him.
6434350	eng	Tom and Mary sat side by side on the sofa.
6434351	eng	Tom and Mary hung up the laundry together.
6434352	eng	Tom and Mary don't hug each other anymore.
6434353	eng	Tom and Mary adopted John three years ago.
6434354	eng	Tom and I'll hang up the laundry together.
6434355	eng	Tom agreed to meet with Mary in the lobby.
6434356	eng	They knocked thirty dollars off the price.
6434357	eng	There's nothing I like more than swimming.
6434358	eng	There's not much chance of that happening.
6434359	eng	There's a jewelry store not far from here.
6434360	eng	There was nothing we could do to help Tom.
6434361	eng	The book I bought yesterday was expensive.
6434362	eng	Personally, I think you shouldn't do that.
6434363	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that today.
6434364	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that again.
6434365	eng	Mary's husband told me she wasn't at home.
6434366	eng	Mary will do anything she can to help Tom.
6434367	eng	Mary wasn't a popular girl in high school.
6434368	eng	Mary told Tom she wanted something to eat.
6434369	eng	Mary talked to Tom about that, didn't she?
6434370	eng	Mary showed us a picture of her boyfriend.
6434371	eng	Mary showed me a picture of her boyfriend.
6434372	eng	Mary says she wants to show Tom something.
6434373	eng	Mary plans to break up with her boyfriend.
6434374	eng	Mary looks almost identical to her sister.
6434375	eng	Mary didn't tell me Tom was her boyfriend.
6434376	eng	Mary bought herself a dress for the party.
6434377	eng	Many of Tom's friends think he's a genius.
6434378	eng	It's unlikely that Tom will be here today.
6434379	eng	It's time for the kids to go to bed.
6434380	eng	It's probably going to be safe to do that.
6434381	eng	It's going to take longer than you expect.
6434382	eng	It's going to take a long time to do that.
6434383	eng	It's going to be sunny tomorrow afternoon.
6434384	eng	It's going to be crowded everywhere today.
6434385	eng	It's a good thing that Tom didn't do that.
6434386	eng	It seems Tom is having trouble doing that.
6434387	eng	It looks like Tom hasn't shaved in a week.
6434388	eng	I've been studying French for three hours.
6434389	eng	I'm sure that Tom won't help Mary do that.
6434390	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't mind if we did that.
6434391	eng	I'm sure Tom could teach you how to drive.
6434392	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom will be there tonight.
6434393	eng	I'm going to give all my possessions away.
6434394	eng	I'll tell Tom you're not going to do that.
6434395	eng	I'd rather not do that if I don't have to.
6434396	eng	I'd like to stay here for three more days.
6434397	eng	I wonder if Tom's friends would help Mary.
6434398	eng	I wonder if Tom really did that on Monday.
6434399	eng	I wonder how much Tom got paid to do that.
6434400	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to Mary about that.
6434401	eng	I wish I could do that today, but I can't.
6434402	eng	I was the one who taught Tom how to drive.
6434403	eng	I want to know if you know how to do that.
6434404	eng	I tried to hug Tom, but he pushed me away.
6434405	eng	I think that's going to happen quite soon.
6434406	eng	I think Tom should do that somewhere else.
6434407	eng	I think Tom didn't do what he said he did.
6434408	eng	I think Tom could teach Mary how to drive.
6434409	eng	I think I'll never get used to doing this.
6434410	eng	I suppose I really ought to do that today.
6434411	eng	I really don't like the way Tom does that.
6434412	eng	I never listen to classical music anymore.
6434413	eng	I have a few friends who can speak French.
6434414	eng	I had to drive home because Tom was drunk.
6434415	eng	I find it hard to understand Tom's French.
6434416	eng	I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
6434417	eng	I don't think you should do that with Tom.
6434418	eng	I don't think Tom will be here until 2:30.
6434419	eng	I don't think Tom is obligated to do that.
6434420	eng	I don't really like the way Tom does that.
6434421	eng	I don't always kiss my children goodnight.
6434422	eng	I can't remember what happened after that.
6434423	eng	How much time will it take you to do that?
6434424	eng	How much time will it take Tom to do that?
6434425	eng	How much money do you usually have on you?
6434426	eng	How many times a month does Tom come here?
6434427	eng	How many sandwiches did Tom make for Mary?
6434428	eng	How long have you spent doing that so far?
6434429	eng	How long do you intend to keep doing that?
6434430	eng	How do you think Tom will propose to Mary?
6434431	eng	How did you find out that Tom kissed Mary?
6434432	eng	How did Tom know we were looking for Mary?
6434433	eng	Have you told Tom why you don't like Mary?
6434434	eng	Don't mothers kiss their children anymore?
6434435	eng	Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
6434436	eng	Do you think Tom will come to pick you up?
6434437	eng	Do you think Tom is ever going to do that?
6434438	eng	Do you still feel like eating out tonight?
6434439	eng	Do you have anything planned for tomorrow?
6434440	eng	Did Tom tell Mary why he ate her sandwich?
6434441	eng	Did Tom ask you to go to Boston with Mary?
6434442	eng	Did Tom ask Mary why she ate his sandwich?
6434443	eng	Could you tell me where I can park my car?
6434444	eng	Can you help me clean up before you leave?
6434445	eng	Are you sure that Tom is Mary's boyfriend?
6434446	eng	About thirty people were severely injured.
6434447	eng	"Where did Tom kiss Mary?" "On the cheek."
6434448	eng	You're just the person I was looking for.
6434449	eng	You don't speak French very well, do you?
6434450	eng	Would you like me to unwrap that for you?
6434451	eng	Would you happen to know where Tom lives?
6434452	eng	Would it be all right if I let Tom drive?
6434453	eng	Would Tom care if Mary ate lunch with me?
6434454	eng	With friends like Tom, who needs enemies?
6434455	eng	Why isn't Tom hanging up the laundry now?
6434456	eng	Why don't you want to go to school today?
6434457	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't like Boston?
6434458	eng	Why do you let Tom to treat you that way?
6434459	eng	Why didn't you do what I asked you to do?
6434460	eng	Who does Tom think is going to help Mary?
6434461	eng	Who did Tom think would do that for Mary?

6434471	eng	What do you think Tom's favorite food is?
6434472	eng	What Tom wanted was some peace and quiet.
6434473	eng	We don't know what caused that to happen.
6434474	eng	Tom's wife died three hours after he did.
6434475	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary sing with his band.
6434476	eng	Tom wouldn't be doing that now, would he?
6434477	eng	Tom would do anything to make keep happy.
6434478	eng	Tom would do anything to make Mary happy.

6435037	eng	Tom couldn't hear what Mary were saying.
6435038	eng	Tom could've lied to you, but he didn't.
6435039	eng	Tom congratulated Mary on her promotion.
6435040	eng	Tom claims he doesn't remember anything.
6435041	eng	Tom claimed he didn't remember anything.
6435042	eng	Tom came here this morning to help Mary.
6435043	eng	Tom borrowed a pair of gloves from Mary.
6435044	eng	Tom asked Mary to follow him downstairs.
6435045	eng	Tom and Mary sometimes eat out together.
6435046	eng	Tom and Mary haven't discussed that yet.
6435047	eng	Tom and Mary have all sorts of problems.
6435048	eng	Tom and I often kiss each other goodbye.
6435049	eng	Tom and I haven't kissed in a long time.
6435050	eng	Tom advised Mary to eat more vegetables.
6435051	eng	Three million dollars is a lot of money.
6435052	eng	These flowers are for Mary, not for you.
6435053	eng	These are the pictures I took on Monday.
6435054	eng	There's no reason Tom would've run away.
6435055	eng	There's a supermarket on the next block.
6435056	eng	There were only a few people on the bus.
6435057	eng	The suitcase Tom was carrying was empty.
6435058	eng	That happened Monday afternoon at Tom's.
6435059	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has to do that now.
6435060	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever done that.
6435061	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has ever been here.
6435062	eng	Neighbors said they heard Tom screaming.
6435063	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want to sing.
6435064	eng	My favorite restaurant is Chuck's Diner.
6435065	eng	Mary told me her husband's name was Tom.
6435066	eng	Mary talks about her ex-boyfriend a lot.
6435067	eng	Mary didn't tell me Tom was her husband.
6435068	eng	Mary didn't tell me Tom was her brother.
6435069	eng	Let's keep doing this as long as we can.
6435070	eng	Let's just rest here for a little while.
6435071	eng	It's unlikely that Tom will do that now.
6435072	eng	It's probably not going to happen today.
6435073	eng	It's going to take some time to do that.
6435074	eng	It's going to take at least three hours.
6435075	eng	It's going to take an hour to get there.
6435076	eng	It's going to clear up in the afternoon.
6435077	eng	It's going to be easy for us to do that.
6435078	eng	It's going to be easy for me to do that.
6435079	eng	It was lucky you were there to help Tom.
6435080	eng	It looks like Tom will get into Harvard.
6435081	eng	It didn't take you much time to do that.
6435082	eng	It didn't take Tom very long to do that.
6435083	eng	It didn't take Tom much time to do that.
6435084	eng	If we're lucky, it'll be sunny tomorrow.
6435085	eng	I've only heard Tom play the banjo once.
6435086	eng	I'm prepared to lie to Tom if I have to.
6435087	eng	I'm not sure Tom would let Mary do that.
6435088	eng	I'm not going to teach you how to drive.
6435089	eng	I'd rather not to lie to Tom about that.
6435090	eng	I'd be surprised if Tom let you do that.
6435091	eng	I wouldn't want to do that for a living.
6435092	eng	I wonder why Tom won't let Mary do that.
6435093	eng	I wonder whether Tom would let me drive.
6435094	eng	I wonder if you could help me with this.
6435095	eng	I wish I'd never lied to Tom about that.
6435096	eng	I want to know if you know who did that.
6435097	eng	I told Tom the same thing you told Mary.
6435098	eng	I told Tom the same thing Mary told him.
6435099	eng	I think Tom will propose to you tonight.
6435100	eng	I think Tom understood your explanation.
6435101	eng	I think Tom should tell Mary to do that.
6435102	eng	I suggest you stop doing that right now.
6435103	eng	I still wonder why Tom let Mary do that.
6435104	eng	I should've brought my umbrella with me.
6435105	eng	I promise I'll do that before I go home.
6435106	eng	I know that Tom expects me to help Mary.
6435107	eng	I know Tom and Mary want to get married.
6435108	eng	I just found out that Tom won't do that.
6435109	eng	I hope Tom doesn't find out what we did.
6435110	eng	I hope Tom does what we asked him to do.
6435111	eng	I have visited Tom many times in Boston.
6435112	eng	I don't think the weather will clear up.
6435113	eng	I don't think Tom would ever forget you.
6435114	eng	I don't think Tom will be too much help.
6435115	eng	I don't think Tom was telling the truth.
6435116	eng	I don't really like punk rock very much.
6435117	eng	I didn't think Tom would let Mary drive.
6435118	eng	How much would you charge me to do that?

6435131	eng	How long has Tom been working in Boston?
6435132	eng	How did you know Tom wouldn't kiss Mary?
6435133	eng	Hopefully, it won't be raining tomorrow.
6435134	eng	His name is Tom and he's Mary's brother.
6435135	eng	Her name is Mary and she's Tom's sister.
6435136	eng	Has Tom ever lied to you about anything?
6435137	eng	French is my favorite subject in school.
6435138	eng	Don't you remember what Tom did to Mary?
6435139	eng	Do you really think it'll snow tomorrow?
6435140	eng	Do you really think Tom will believe me?
6435141	eng	Did you bring what I asked you to bring?
6435142	eng	Did Tom really think we would help Mary?
6435143	eng	Could you tell me what needs to be done?
6435144	eng	Can you tell me where I should put this?
6435145	eng	Are you sure that Tom really likes Mary?
6435146	eng	Are you sure that Tom doesn't like Mary?
6435147	eng	Are you still working at the same place?
6435148	eng	You'd better stop doing that right now.
6435149	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about that.
6435150	eng	You shouldn't have been so mean to Tom.
6435151	eng	You should tell Tom that you love Mary.
6435152	eng	Would you like me to unwrap it for you?
6435153	eng	Why don't you help Tom paint the fence?
6435154	eng	Why do you think Tom shouldn't do that?
6435155	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't trust you?
6435156	eng	Why are you always so hard on yourself?

6435163	eng	We need to find out where Tom was born.

6435393	eng	It's hard to believe that Tom did that.
6435394	eng	It's going to stop raining before long.
6435395	eng	It's going to be impossible to do that.
6435396	eng	It's fine by me if you want to do that.

6435409	eng	If we don't do something, Tom will die.
6435410	eng	I've spoken to Tom and he says he's OK.
6435411	eng	I've been waiting here for a long time.
6435412	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't agree to do that.
6435413	eng	I'm sure Tom will be cut from the team.
6435414	eng	I'm not sure who I should give this to.
6435415	eng	I'm glad we're able to do that for Tom.
6435416	eng	I'm getting a little worried about Tom.

6435429	eng	I wasn't able to persuade Tom to drive.
6435430	eng	I was hoping Tom would do that with us.
6435431	eng	I told Tom he could buy what he wanted.
6435432	eng	I think Tom won't do that anytime soon.

6435447	eng	I have only one friend who likes opera.
6435448	eng	I forgot to tell Tom about the meeting.
6435449	eng	I doubt that Tom will ever forget that.
6435450	eng	I don't think you should do that today.

6435452	eng	I don't really like this kind of music.
6435453	eng	I don't go there as often as I used to.

6435749	eng	I wouldn't want to be a brain surgeon.
6435750	eng	I wonder if you could help me do that.
6435751	eng	I wonder if Tom lied to us about that.
6435752	eng	I wonder if Tom is still eating lunch.
6435753	eng	I wish you'd told me you were married.
6435754	eng	I wish Tom had told me he was married.
6435755	eng	I was hoping Tom would do that for us.
6435756	eng	I wanted Tom to teach me how to drive.
6435757	eng	I want to drive, but Tom won't let me.
6435758	eng	I think you should charge $30 an hour.
6435759	eng	I think we can all go in the same car.
6435760	eng	I think Tom will do something drastic.
6435761	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to kiss him.
6435762	eng	I think Tom doesn't understand French.
6435763	eng	I shouldn't have kissed Tom yesterday.
6435764	eng	I saw Tom at the station this morning.
6435765	eng	I never used to do that, but I do now.
6435766	eng	I know Tom will try to arrive on time.
6435767	eng	I knew Tom would lie to us about that.
6435768	eng	I hope we don't have to wait too long.
6435769	eng	I hope it doesn't rain this afternoon.
6435770	eng	I hope everything turns out all right.
6435771	eng	I hope Tom and Mary eat lunch with us.
6435772	eng	I hope I can go home for the holidays.
6435773	eng	I heard that you kissed Tom yesterday.
6435774	eng	I have many other things I want to do.
6435775	eng	I have many other things I need to do.
6435776	eng	I have many other things I have to do.
6435777	eng	I doubt that Tom will ever leave Mary.
6435778	eng	I don't think Tom will wait very long.
6435779	eng	I don't think Tom will stay very long.
6435780	eng	I don't know why Tom let Mary do that.
6435781	eng	I don't know where I left my umbrella.
6435782	eng	I don't know anything about computers.
6435783	eng	I didn't think Tom would let me drive.
6435784	eng	I can't remember Tom's brother's name.

6435796	eng	How many people do you know in Boston?
6435797	eng	How many days did you spend in Boston?
6435798	eng	Her name is Mary and she's Tom's wife.
6435799	eng	Have you ever made a speech in French?
6435800	eng	Give me some time to think about that.
6435801	eng	Does that mean that Tom won't do that?
6435802	eng	Does Tom know why you don't like Mary?
6435803	eng	Does Tom know how you feel about Mary?
6435804	eng	Do you know why Tom doesn't trust you?
6435805	eng	Did Tom say where we should meet Mary?
6435806	eng	Did Mary tell you about her boyfriend?
6435807	eng	Are you really going to let Tom drive?
6435808	eng	About thirty people have been injured.
6435809	eng	A lot of people I know live in Boston.
6435810	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom about it.
6435811	eng	You should've let me do that for you.
6435812	eng	You know what Tom will do, don't you?
6435813	eng	Would you like me to wrap it for you?
6435814	eng	Why were you the last one to do that?
6435815	eng	Why do you think Tom doesn't do that?

6435820	eng	Where do you think Tom will go today?
6435821	eng	When does Tom expect us to help Mary?
6435822	eng	Whatever you do, don't let Tom drive.
6435823	eng	We shouldn't kiss each other anymore.
6435824	eng	We know that Tom sometimes hits Mary.
6435825	eng	We know that Tom sometimes does that.
6435826	eng	We got the results that we hoped for.
6435827	eng	We can't predict what Tom will think.

6435840	eng	Tom will be very happy Mary did that.
6435841	eng	Tom will be mad at us for doing this.
6435842	eng	Tom will be late if he doesn't hurry.
6435843	eng	Tom will be happy to see that happen.
6435844	eng	Tom will ask Mary if she can do that.
6435845	eng	Tom wasn't the first man Mary kissed.
6435846	eng	Tom wasn't really excited about that.
6435847	eng	Tom wasn't expecting me to help Mary.
6435848	eng	Tom was waiting for Mary to call him.

6435866	eng	Tom thought Mary would never do that.
6435867	eng	Tom spent most of the day doing that.
6435868	eng	Tom spent all afternoon helping Mary.
6435869	eng	Tom sometimes feeds his cat dog food.
6435870	eng	Tom should've told me he was married.
6435871	eng	Tom should've been ready an hour ago.
6435872	eng	Tom should never have let Mary drive.

6436013	eng	Tom didn't do that very well, did he?
6436014	eng	Tom didn't come in to work yesterday.
6436015	eng	Tom convinced Mary to tell the truth.
6436016	eng	Tom came here to ask us to help Mary.
6436017	eng	Tom called me at 2:30 in the morning.
6436018	eng	Tom asked me to walk a little slower.
6436019	eng	Tom asked Mary to tell him the truth.
6436020	eng	Tom asked Mary to stay away from him.
6436021	eng	Tom apparently wants to learn French.
6436022	eng	Tom and Mary were alone on the beach.
6436023	eng	Tom and Mary seem like a nice couple.
6436024	eng	Tom and Mary sat at the picnic table.
6436025	eng	Tom and Mary have both eaten already.
6436026	eng	Tom and Mary aren't on the same team.
6436027	eng	Tom and Mary are high school seniors.
6436028	eng	Tom and I haven't discussed that yet.
6436029	eng	Tom almost never kisses his children.
6436030	eng	These suitcases are Tom's and Mary's.
6436031	eng	These are Tom's and Mary's umbrellas.
6436032	eng	These are Tom's and Mary's suitcases.
6436033	eng	There's a perfectly good explanation.
6436034	eng	There's a barbershop across the road.
6436035	eng	There are lots of people who do that.
6436036	eng	The only thing Tom could do was wait.
6436037	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has gone abroad.
6436038	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has found a job.
6436039	eng	My guess is that Tom won't want that.
6436040	eng	Mary thought the man she saw was Tom.
6436041	eng	Mary thought the boy she saw was Tom.
6436042	eng	Mary is kind of beautiful, isn't she?
6436043	eng	Make sure Tom doesn't leave his room.
6436044	eng	Let's keep this up as long as we can.
6436045	eng	It's quite unlikely Tom will do that.
6436046	eng	It's probably going to snow tomorrow.
6436047	eng	It's going to be dark in a few hours.
6436048	eng	It's going to be an interesting game.
6436049	eng	It's fine by me if you don't do that.
6436050	eng	It'll be difficult to find a job now.
6436051	eng	It won't be all that easy to do that.
6436052	eng	It was Tom who kissed Mary yesterday.
6436053	eng	It should be easy for Tom to do that.
6436054	eng	It is inevitable that that'll happen.
6436055	eng	It doesn't make any difference to me.
6436056	eng	I've quit drinking carbonated drinks.
6436057	eng	I've been waiting for you since 2:30.
6436058	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't need to do that.
6436059	eng	I'm sure Tom doesn't have to do that.
6436060	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom wouldn't do that.
6436061	eng	I'm fairly certain that won't happen.
6436062	eng	I'd rather stay home and read a book.
6436063	eng	I'd rather not to lie to Tom anymore.
6436064	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it snowed.
6436065	eng	I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.
6436066	eng	I wonder whether Tom would help Mary.
6436067	eng	I wish my parents would let me drive.
6436068	eng	I wish Tom hadn't lied to the police.
6436069	eng	I wish Tom had asked us to help Mary.
6436070	eng	I wish Tom had asked Mary to help us.
6436071	eng	I told Tom that I'd help him do that.
6436072	eng	I think we shouldn't let Tom do that.
6436073	eng	I think this is exactly what we need.
6436074	eng	I think that it was Tom who did that.
6436075	eng	I think that Tom ate all the bananas.
6436076	eng	I think Tom's leg is much better now.
6436077	eng	I think Tom wants me to go with Mary.
6436078	eng	I think Tom expected Mary to hug him.
6436079	eng	I think Tom doesn't enjoy doing that.
6436080	eng	I talked to my attorney this morning.
6436081	eng	I know the girl who's talking to Tom.
6436082	eng	I hope you didn't give Tom any money.
6436083	eng	I hope Tom and Mary do that together.
6436084	eng	I hear that you kissed Tom yesterday.
6436085	eng	I haven't seen a good movie recently.
6436086	eng	I don't want to think about that now.
6436087	eng	I don't want to go home empty-handed.
6436088	eng	I don't think you should do that now.
6436089	eng	I don't think Tom would let me drive.
6436090	eng	I don't think Tom will need our help.
6436091	eng	I don't think I should let you drive.
6436092	eng	I don't know where I left sunglasses.
6436093	eng	I don't know what I was so afraid of.
6436094	eng	I don't have a place to stay tonight.
6436095	eng	I don't feel like doing that anymore.
6436096	eng	I could've lied to you, but I didn't.
6436097	eng	I can't imagine that happening to me.
6436098	eng	I asked Tom to teach me how to drive.
6436099	eng	How much would you pay us to do that?
6436100	eng	How much water does this bucket hold?
6436101	eng	How much time did it take to do that?
6436102	eng	How much snow do you think we'll get?
6436103	eng	How much more do we need to do today?
6436104	eng	How much money have you saved so far?
6436105	eng	How much money has Tom stolen so far?
6436106	eng	How much money does a carpenter make?

6436723	eng	Lend me a hand with this, will you?
6436724	eng	It's no secret that Tom likes Mary.
6436725	eng	It's my intention to do that today.
6436726	eng	It's hard to tell what Tom will do.
6436727	eng	It's going to take time to do that.
6436728	eng	It's going to be tiring to do that.
6436729	eng	It might be easy for us to do that.
6436730	eng	It might be easy for me to do that.

6436740	eng	I'd suggest not doing that anymore.
6436741	eng	I'd expected Tom to lie about that.
6436742	eng	I wonder if Tom would let me drive.
6436743	eng	I won't let Tom drive my car again.

6436745	eng	I wish I hadn't lied to the police.
6436746	eng	I wish I could live on Park Street.
6436747	eng	I was tempted to lie, but I didn't.
6436748	eng	I usually take a shower before bed.
6436749	eng	I tried to persuade Tom to help me.
6436750	eng	I told Tom I wanted him to help me.

6436752	eng	I think you should stop doing that.
6436753	eng	I think that this is Tom's bicycle.

6436755	eng	I talked to my lawyer this morning.
6436756	eng	I promised Tom that we'd help Mary.
6436757	eng	I often drive over the speed limit.

6436765	eng	I don't think Tom misses Mary much.

6436782	eng	How do you know what you should do?
6436783	eng	How can people do things like that?
6436784	eng	Give me a hand with this, will you?
6436785	eng	Don't tell me you're already drunk.
6436786	eng	Do you think Tom will let me drive?
6436787	eng	Do you think I need to lose weight?
6436788	eng	Did you hug you children yesterday?
6436789	eng	Did you have a fun time last night?
6436790	eng	Did Tom drive to Boston by himself?
6436791	eng	About thirty people have been hurt.
6436792	eng	A little help would be appreciated.
6436793	eng	You should really stop doing that.
6436794	eng	You didn't sell your car, did you?
6436795	eng	You didn't let Tom drive, did you?
6436796	eng	You didn't hurt yourself, did you?
6436797	eng	Would you please not do that here?
6436798	eng	Why is Tom so hesitant to do that?
6436799	eng	Why is Tom always so mean to Mary?
6436800	eng	Why do girls I don't like like me?
6436801	eng	Why did you turn down their offer?
6436802	eng	Why can't you be more considerate?
6436803	eng	Why are you trying to lose weight?
6436804	eng	Why are you determined to do that?

6436813	eng	What makes you think Tom is wrong?
6436814	eng	What have you accomplished so far?
6436815	eng	What are you going to buy for Tom?
6436816	eng	What Tom saw was changed his life.
6436817	eng	What Tom did didn't surprise Mary.
6436818	eng	We're going to the beach tomorrow.
6436819	eng	We're fortunate to still be alive.
6436820	eng	We'll do that as soon as possible.
6436821	eng	We won't be able to do that today.
6436822	eng	We seldom kiss each other anymore.

6437186	eng	Are you sure that Tom is busy now?
