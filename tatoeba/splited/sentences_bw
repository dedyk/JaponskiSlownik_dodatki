2543531	eng	I'm not letting Tom do this.
2543532	eng	I'm not letting Tom do that.
2543533	eng	I'm not leaving without you.
2543534	eng	I'm not leaving without Tom.
2543535	eng	I'm not in a very good mood.
2543536	eng	I'm not going to your place.
2543537	eng	I'm not going to work today.
2543538	eng	I'm not going to wear a tie.
2543539	eng	I'm not going to waste time.
2543540	eng	I'm not going to mess it up.
2543541	eng	I'm not going to marry Mary.
2543542	eng	I'm not going to forget you.
2543543	eng	I'm not getting any younger.
2543544	eng	I'm not certain Tom is here.
2543545	eng	I'm not being paid for this.
2543546	eng	I'm not ashamed of anything.
2543547	eng	I'm not allowed to tell you.
2543548	eng	I'm not allowed to go there.
2543549	eng	I'm not afraid of lightning.
2543550	eng	I'm never helping you again.
2543551	eng	I'm never going to get this.
2543552	eng	I'm never eating here again.
2543553	eng	I'm much older than you are.
2543554	eng	I'm moving as fast as I can.
2543555	eng	I'm making a fool of myself.
2543556	eng	I'm leaving early next week.
2543557	eng	I'm late for an appointment.
2543558	eng	I'm just waiting for a call.
2543559	eng	I'm just trying to help out.
2543560	eng	I'm just trying to find Tom.
2543561	eng	I'm just telling it like it is.
2543562	eng	I'm just glad it's all over.
2543563	eng	I'm just getting used to it.
2543564	eng	I'm just catching my breath.
2543565	eng	I'm just a little surprised.
2543566	eng	I'm intrigued by Tom's idea.
2543567	eng	I'm inclined to believe Tom.
2543568	eng	I'm in love with Tom's wife.
2543569	eng	I'm hoping Tom will help us.
2543570	eng	I'm going to wait till 2:30.
2543571	eng	I'm going to use your phone.
2543572	eng	I'm going to think about it.
2543573	eng	I'm going to the men's room.
2543574	eng	I'm going to tell the truth.
2543575	eng	I'm going to take this home.
2543576	eng	I'm going to start tomorrow.
2543577	eng	I'm going to need you later.
2543578	eng	I'm going to need some help.
2543579	eng	I'm going to meet Tom there.
2543580	eng	I'm going to let you go now.
2543581	eng	I'm going to head back home.
2543582	eng	I'm going to go wake Tom up.
2543583	eng	I'm going to go talk to Tom.
2543584	eng	I'm going to go make dinner.
2543585	eng	I'm going to go get Tom now.
2543586	eng	I'm going to give it to Tom.
2543587	eng	I'm going to get your pills.
2543588	eng	I'm going to get us a drink.
2543589	eng	I'm going to get some sleep.
2543590	eng	I'm going to do you a favor.
2543591	eng	I'm going to do this myself.
2543592	eng	I'm going to crash at Tom's.
2543593	eng	I'm going to check upstairs.
2543594	eng	I'm going to be your lawyer.
2543595	eng	I'm going back to my office.
2543596	eng	I'm glad you're enjoying it.
2543597	eng	I'm glad you suggested this.
2543598	eng	I'm glad we're together now.
2543599	eng	I'm glad we're in agreement.
2543600	eng	I'm glad to see you're safe.
2543601	eng	I'm glad it's taken care of.
2543602	eng	I'm glad I was able to help.
2543603	eng	I'm glad I could be of help.
2543604	eng	I'm getting ahead of myself.
2543605	eng	I'm getting advice from Tom.
2543606	eng	I'm getting a little hungry.
2543607	eng	I'm doing what I have to do.
2543608	eng	I'm curious about one thing.
2543609	eng	I'm calling the meeting off.
2543610	eng	I'm better looking than you.
2543611	eng	I'm beginning to understand.
2543612	eng	I'm aware of its importance.
2543613	eng	I'm at home most of the day.
2543614	eng	I'm always the last to know.
2543615	eng	I'm afraid we're stuck here.
2543616	eng	I'm afraid Tom will kill me.
2543617	eng	I'm afraid Tom had to leave.
2543618	eng	I'm afraid it's unavoidable.
2543619	eng	I'm afraid I have no choice.
2543620	eng	I'm a little thirsty myself.
2543621	eng	I'll wait for you to finish.
2543622	eng	I'll try to keep this brief.
2543623	eng	I'll text you when I'm done.
2543624	eng	I'll tell you what we'll do.
2543625	eng	I'll tell you what happened.
2543626	eng	I'll tell you the truth now.
2543627	eng	I'll tell Tom you were here.
2543628	eng	I'll tell Tom you said that.
2543629	eng	I'll take your word on that.
2543630	eng	I'll take care of it myself.
2543631	eng	I'll still be here tomorrow.
2543632	eng	I'll stay here and help Tom.
2543633	eng	I'll show you how it's done.
2543634	eng	I'll settle things with Tom.
2543635	eng	I'll set up the appointment.
2543636	eng	I'll see you in three hours.
2543637	eng	I'll see you before I leave.
2543638	eng	I'll see you at the airport.
2543639	eng	I'll see you after the show.
2543640	eng	I'll see you after practice.
2543641	eng	I'll see Tom tomorrow night.
2543642	eng	I'll see to that personally.
2543643	eng	I'll probably see you there.
2543644	eng	I'll pick you up after work.
2543645	eng	I'll pick up Tom in an hour.
2543646	eng	I'll pick Tom up in an hour.
2543647	eng	I'll pay you back next week.
2543648	eng	I'll never get used to this.
2543649	eng	I'll never get used to that.
2543650	eng	I'll need to think about it.
2543651	eng	I'll meet up with you later.
2543652	eng	I'll look after Tom for you.
2543653	eng	I'll let you think about it.
2543654	eng	I'll let you know how we do.
2543655	eng	I'll let you in on a secret.
2543656	eng	I'll leave it in your hands.
2543657	eng	I'll keep the motor running.
2543658	eng	I'll just go and get my pen.
2543659	eng	I'll help you any way I can.
2543660	eng	I'll help Tom any way I can.
2543661	eng	I'll have Tom call you back.
2543662	eng	I'll have to do it manually.
2543663	eng	I'll have to check with Tom.
2543664	eng	I'll have somebody help you.
2543665	eng	I'll hang onto that for you.
2543666	eng	I'll go to Boston next week.
2543667	eng	I'll go and find it for you.
2543668	eng	I'll give you what you want.
2543669	eng	I'll give you what you need.
2543670	eng	I'll give you some examples.
2543671	eng	I'll get you another lawyer.
2543672	eng	I'll get Tom's home address.
2543673	eng	I'll get started right away.
2543674	eng	I'll get right to the point.
2543675	eng	I'll get on that right away.
2543676	eng	I'll get it right this time.
2543677	eng	I'll get it right next time.
2543678	eng	I'll drive Tom there myself.
2543679	eng	I'll do nothing of the sort.
2543680	eng	I'll demonstrate it for you.
2543681	eng	I'll deal with that for you.
2543682	eng	I'll contact you when I can.
2543683	eng	I'll call you if I need you.
2543684	eng	I'll call Tom and apologize.
2543685	eng	I'll bet Tom was pretty mad.
2543686	eng	I'll be your server tonight.
2543687	eng	I'll be very frank with you.
2543688	eng	I'll be there in 30 minutes.
2543689	eng	I'll be taking it from here.
2543690	eng	I'll be right down the hall.
2543691	eng	I'll be perfectly all right.
2543692	eng	I'll be in the waiting room.
2543693	eng	I'll be in Boston next week.
2543694	eng	I'll be here if you need me.
2543695	eng	I'll be coming back tonight.
2543696	eng	I'll be back when I'm ready.
2543697	eng	I'll be back tomorrow night.
2543698	eng	I'll be back this afternoon.
2543699	eng	I'll be back in three hours.
2543700	eng	I'll be back in a few hours.
2543701	eng	I'll be back before morning.
2543702	eng	I'd really love to meet Tom.
2543703	eng	I'd rather not discuss that.
2543704	eng	I'd never betray your trust.
2543705	eng	I'd like to get out of here.
2543706	eng	I'd like for you to help me.
2543707	eng	I'd like a room for tonight.
2543708	eng	I'd heard what had happened.
2543709	eng	I'd have to agree with that.
2543710	eng	I'd do anything to help you.
2543711	eng	I'd do anything to help Tom.
2543712	eng	I'd better get back to work.
2543713	eng	I'd already thought of that.
2543714	eng	I wrote it down on a napkin.
2543715	eng	I wouldn't worry about that.
2543716	eng	I wouldn't mind helping Tom.
2543717	eng	I wouldn't like that either.
2543718	eng	I would've done that anyway.
2543719	eng	I wonder why they chose Tom.
2543720	eng	I wonder when that happened.
2543721	eng	I wonder what it feels like.
2543722	eng	I wonder what became of Tom.
2543723	eng	I wonder if you can help me.
2543724	eng	I wonder if Tom can hear us.
2543725	eng	I won't try to persuade Tom.
2543726	eng	I won't tell you what to do.
2543727	eng	I won't play games with you.
2543728	eng	I won't let it happen again.
2543729	eng	I won't let anyone harm you.
2543730	eng	I won't be back for a while.
2543731	eng	I won't be able to help you.
2543732	eng	I wish you hadn't seen that.
2543733	eng	I wish you had called ahead.
2543734	eng	I wish Tom were still alive.
2543735	eng	I wish Tom could see me now.
2543736	eng	I wish that wasn't the case.
2543737	eng	I wish I'd known Tom better.
2543738	eng	I wish I were more like Tom.
2543739	eng	I wish I had Tom's strength.
2543740	eng	I wish I could believe that.
2543741	eng	I went to the wrong address.
2543742	eng	I went there to talk to Tom.
2543743	eng	I wasn't worried about that.
2543744	eng	I wasn't very hungry anyway.
2543745	eng	I wasn't really in the mood.
2543746	eng	I wasn't expecting visitors.
2543747	eng	I wasn't expecting anything.
2543748	eng	I was wrong not to tell you.
2543749	eng	I was with Tom when he died.
2543750	eng	I was up all night studying.
2543751	eng	I was trying to protect you.
2543752	eng	I was trying to protect Tom.
2543753	eng	I was trying to impress Tom.
2543754	eng	I was traveling on business.
2543755	eng	I was told to report to you.
2543756	eng	I was thinking about Boston.
2543757	eng	I was talking about clothes.
2543758	eng	I was swamped with homework.
2543759	eng	I was right in front of Tom.
2543760	eng	I was pretty good, wasn't I?
2543761	eng	I was out getting groceries.
2543762	eng	I was off duty at that time.
2543763	eng	I was never good at grammar.
2543764	eng	I was never good at figures.
2543765	eng	I was lucky to get this job.
2543766	eng	I was lucky to get that job.
2543767	eng	I was just talking with Tom.
2543768	eng	I was just pulling your leg.
2543769	eng	I was just messing with you.
2543770	eng	I was just following orders.
2543771	eng	I was in Australia with Tom.
2543772	eng	I was here when you came in.
2543773	eng	I was going to vote for Tom.
2543774	eng	I was going to surprise you.
2543775	eng	I was going to do it myself.
2543776	eng	I was going to do it anyway.
2543777	eng	I was going over Tom's file.
2543778	eng	I was away for five minutes.
2543779	eng	I was asked to deliver this.
2543780	eng	I was afraid you'd say that.
2543781	eng	I was afraid you'd ask that.
2543782	eng	I want to wish you the best.
2543783	eng	I want to talk to the press.
2543784	eng	I want to be with my family.
2543785	eng	I used to sing you to sleep.
2543786	eng	I used to sing Tom to sleep.
2543787	eng	I used to pretend I was Tom.
2543788	eng	I used to have one of those.
2543789	eng	I used to do the same thing.
2543790	eng	I used to be a teacher here.
2543791	eng	I understand what you meant.
2543792	eng	I understand everything now.
2543793	eng	I tried calling your office.
2543794	eng	I took Tom's blood pressure.
2543795	eng	I took care of that for you.
2543796	eng	I told you Tom didn't do it.
2543797	eng	I told you not to come here.
2543798	eng	I told you it was dangerous.
2543799	eng	I told you I couldn't do it.
2543800	eng	I told you I could help you.
2543801	eng	I told you I can't help you.
2543802	eng	I told Tom which one I like.
2543803	eng	I told Tom we'd be late.
2543804	eng	I told Tom to tell you that.
2543805	eng	I told Tom to make the deal.
2543806	eng	I told Tom to make his move.
2543807	eng	I told Tom not to tell Mary.
2543808	eng	I told Tom not to come here.
2543809	eng	I told Tom not to come back.
2543810	eng	I told Tom it was a mistake.
2543811	eng	I told Tom I made a mistake.
2543812	eng	I told Tom I couldn't do it.
2543813	eng	I thought you wouldn't mind.
2543814	eng	I thought you were with Tom.
2543815	eng	I thought you were grounded.
2543816	eng	I thought you were a doctor.
2543817	eng	I thought you understood me.
2543818	eng	I thought you ought to know.
2543819	eng	I thought you might need it.
2543820	eng	I thought you loved reading.
2543821	eng	I thought you left with Tom.
2543822	eng	I thought you could help us.
2543823	eng	I thought we'd surprise you.
2543824	eng	I thought we could help Tom.
2543825	eng	I thought Tom was very good.
2543826	eng	I thought Tom was in school.
2543827	eng	I thought Tom was in prison.
2543828	eng	I thought Tom was fantastic.
2543829	eng	I thought Tom sounded upset.
2543830	eng	I thought Tom sounded happy.
2543831	eng	I thought Tom sounded angry.
2543832	eng	I thought Tom had potential.
2543833	eng	I thought Tom had left town.
2543834	eng	I thought this might happen.
2543835	eng	I thought that sounded good.
2543836	eng	I thought I made that clear.
2543837	eng	I thought I heard a gunshot.
2543838	eng	I thought I could handle it.
2543839	eng	I think you know I like you.
2543840	eng	I said all I'm going to say.
2543841	eng	I picked Tom up from school.
2543842	eng	I need to talk to Tom first.
2543843	eng	I meet new people every day.
2543844	eng	I looked over the documents.
2543845	eng	I left my wallet in the car.
2543846	eng	I know where you want to be.
2543847	eng	I hope Tom doesn't get sick.
2543848	eng	I don't want Tom to do that.
2543849	eng	I don't know if I can do it.
2543850	eng	I don't have anything to do.
2543851	eng	I bought a pair of scissors.
2543852	eng	I bought a pair of earrings.
2543853	eng	Don't you have any ambition?
2543854	eng	Do you know what this means?
2543855	eng	Both of them started crying.
2543856	eng	Aren't you curious about it?
2543857	eng	Your French is good enough.
2543858	eng	Your car's totally wrecked.
2543859	eng	You've told me that before.
2543860	eng	You've saved all our lives.
2543861	eng	You've said nothing so far.
2543862	eng	You've quit smoking, right?
2543863	eng	You've hurt Tom's feelings.
2543864	eng	You've got to come out now.
2543865	eng	You're with me, aren't you?
2543866	eng	You're up late, aren't you?
2543867	eng	You're too weak to do that.
2543868	eng	Your time is running out.
2543869	eng	You're thirty minutes late.
2543870	eng	You're not scared, are you?
2543871	eng	You're not joking, are you?
2543872	eng	You're good at what you do.
2543873	eng	You're always welcome here.
2543874	eng	You're a very good teacher.
2543875	eng	You're a great-looking guy.
2543876	eng	You'll have to be the boss.
2543877	eng	You'll be there in no time.
2543878	eng	You'd regret that, I think.
2543879	eng	You would never understand.
2543880	eng	You won't get away with it.
2543881	eng	You won't find it in there.
2543882	eng	You won't be safe anywhere.
2543883	eng	You picked Tom, didn't you?
2543884	eng	You know Tom wants to help.
2543885	eng	You know this is different.
2543886	eng	You know this is a mistake.
2543887	eng	You have something of mine.
2543888	eng	You have a good reputation.
2543889	eng	You have a good heart, Tom.
2543890	eng	You don't know anyone here.
2543891	eng	You ask a lot of questions.
2543892	eng	Would you stop saying that?
2543893	eng	Would you please step back?
2543894	eng	Would you please excuse us?
2543895	eng	Would you please come here?
2543896	eng	Would you help me out here?
2543897	eng	Why should I buy a new car?
2543898	eng	Why are you wearing gloves?
2543899	eng	Why are you angry with Tom?
2543900	eng	Whatever you do, don't cry.
2543901	eng	What's your husband's name?
2543902	eng	What're you thinking about?
2543903	eng	We're waiting to be served.
2543904	eng	We're running out of money.
2543905	eng	We're not throwing it away.
2543906	eng	We're asking the questions.
2543907	eng	We're about to have guests.
2543908	eng	We're about to have dinner.
2543909	eng	We'll be there in a minute.
2543910	eng	We'll all be together soon.
2543911	eng	We wouldn't stand a chance.

2544298	eng	I'll be staying in a motel.
2544299	eng	I'll be back when I'm done.
2544300	eng	I'll be back for you later.
2544301	eng	I'll be back for Tom later.
2544302	eng	I'll be able to assist you.
2544303	eng	I'll be a few more minutes.
2544304	eng	I'll ask you one last time.
2544305	eng	I'll always care about you.
2544306	eng	I'll always believe in you.
2544307	eng	I'd trust Tom with my life.
2544308	eng	I'd think you'd understand.
2544309	eng	I'd think that was obvious.
2544310	eng	I'd say that's a good idea.
2544311	eng	I'd recognize you anywhere.
2544312	eng	I'd recognize Tom anywhere.
2544313	eng	I'd rather not discuss Tom.
2544314	eng	I'd love some help on this.
2544315	eng	I'd like to speak with you.
2544316	eng	I'd like to buy you dinner.
2544317	eng	I'd like some help, please.
2544318	eng	I'd know if you were lying.
2544319	eng	I'd better think this over.
2544320	eng	I'd better tell the others.
2544321	eng	I'd better get back inside.
2544322	eng	I'd better do it right now.
2544323	eng	I'd better be getting home.
2544324	eng	I'd be quiet if I were you.
2544325	eng	I wouldn't worry about Tom.
2544326	eng	I wouldn't put it past Tom.
2544327	eng	I wouldn't know what to do.
2544328	eng	I wouldn't get my hopes up.
2544329	eng	I would've had a good time.
2544330	eng	I work for a guy named Tom.
2544331	eng	I wonder who Tom talked to.
2544332	eng	I wonder who made all this.
2544333	eng	I wonder where everyone is.
2544334	eng	I wonder what Tom will say.
2544335	eng	I wonder what Tom is up to.
2544336	eng	I wonder if Tom likes blue.
2544337	eng	I wonder if Tom knows Mary.
2544338	eng	I won't let it go to waste.
2544339	eng	I won't be ready for weeks.
2544340	eng	I won't be home for a week.
2544341	eng	I won't be here next month.
2544342	eng	I won't be coming with you.
2544343	eng	I won't be a party to this.
2544344	eng	I woke up and Tom was gone.
2544345	eng	I wish you would stop that.
2544346	eng	I wish Tom would stop that.
2544347	eng	I wish Tom were still here.
2544348	eng	I wish Tom had left a note.
2544349	eng	I wish there was more time.
2544350	eng	I wish it were that simple.
2544351	eng	I wish I had your strength.
2544352	deu	Ich finde, dass Tom nicht in der Lage ist, das zu tun.
2544353	eng	I wish I didn't have to go.
2544354	eng	I wish I could talk to you.
2544355	eng	I wish I could talk to Tom.
2544356	eng	I wish I could remember it.
2544357	eng	I wish I could go with you.
2544358	eng	I wish I could believe you.
2544359	eng	I went to college with Tom.
2544360	eng	I went over to Tom's house.
2544361	eng	I went by there last night.
2544362	eng	I wasn't thinking straight.
2544363	eng	I wasn't talking about you.
2544364	eng	I wasn't talking about Tom.
2544365	eng	I wasn't stealing anything.
2544366	eng	I wasn't home at that time.
2544367	eng	I wasn't here a moment ago.
2544368	eng	I wasn't going to hurt you.
2544369	eng	I was young and naive then.
2544370	eng	I was with Tom for an hour.
2544371	eng	I was up all night reading.
2544372	eng	I was trying to rescue Tom.
2544373	eng	I was the first to sign up.
2544374	eng	I was looking for my diary.
2544375	eng	I was just looking for you.
2544376	eng	I was just looking for Tom.
2544377	eng	I was just getting started.
2544378	eng	I was hoping you'd tell me.
2544379	eng	I was hoping you'd do that.
2544380	eng	I was hoping we could talk.
2544381	eng	I was holding this for you.
2544382	eng	I was going to quit anyway.
2544383	eng	I was expecting a lot more.
2544384	eng	I was blinded by the light.
2544385	eng	I was away for a few years.
2544386	eng	I want to go back to Tom's.
2544387	eng	I want to become a teacher.
2544388	eng	I want some help with this.
2544389	eng	I usually don't wear a tie.
2544390	eng	I usually don't wear a hat.
2544391	eng	I used to live near a park.
2544392	eng	I used to be rich like you.
2544393	eng	I used to be poor like you.
2544394	eng	I understand the situation.
2544395	eng	I tried to reason with Tom.
2544396	eng	I tried to get Tom to stop.
2544397	eng	I tried to get Tom to come.
2544398	eng	I told you we'd meet again.
2544399	eng	I told you Tom was a loser.
2544400	eng	I told you not to touch me.
2544401	eng	I told you it was too soon.
2544402	eng	I told you it was possible.
2544403	eng	I told you I'd protect you.
2544404	eng	I told you I can't make it.
2544405	eng	I told Tom you were coming.
2544406	eng	I told Tom who I really am.
2544407	eng	I told Tom to stay indoors.
2544408	eng	I told Tom to meet me here.
2544409	eng	I told Tom not to tell you.
2544410	eng	I told Tom I was going out.
2544411	eng	I thought you'd be excited.
2544412	eng	I thought you were on duty.
2544413	eng	I thought you were a nurse.
2544414	eng	I thought you were a ghost.
2544415	eng	I thought you might change.
2544416	eng	I thought you looked tired.
2544417	eng	I thought you had fixed it.
2544418	eng	I thought we were partners.
2544419	eng	I thought we said tomorrow.
2544420	eng	I thought Tom had got lost.
2544421	eng	I thought Tom had given up.
2544422	eng	I thought Tom had blown it.
2544423	eng	I thought this was settled.
2544424	eng	I thought it'd take months.
2544425	eng	I thought it'd be too much.
2544426	eng	I thought it was excellent.
2544427	eng	I thought I heard a scream.
2544428	eng	I thought I could help Tom.
2544429	eng	I thought his name was Tom.
2544430	eng	I still feel a little sick.
2544431	eng	I put in for more overtime.
2544432	eng	I picked Tom up after work.
2544433	eng	I know that Mary is pretty.
2544434	eng	I intend to tell the truth.
2544435	eng	I hope Tom doesn't show up.
2544436	eng	I have to find another job.
2544437	eng	I got you a little present.
2544438	eng	I got kicked out of school.
2544439	eng	I don't want to drink that.
2544440	eng	I don't know much about it.
2544441	eng	I don't know if I can help.
2544442	eng	I don't have a car anymore.
2544443	eng	I can take Tom to the park.
2544444	eng	I bet Tom knows the answer.
2544445	eng	I assume you're in a hurry.
2544446	eng	Have you seen Tom on stage?
2544447	eng	Do you know where Tom went?
2544448	eng	Do you know the difference?
2544449	eng	Did you say something, Tom?
2544450	eng	Beautiful woman, isn't she?
2544451	eng	Are you going to go or not?
2544452	eng	Are you asking me for help?
2544453	eng	Your name's Tom, isn't it?
2544454	eng	You've walked into a trap.
2544455	eng	You've underestimated Tom.
2544456	eng	You've still got your job.
2544457	eng	You've seen what I can do.
2544458	eng	You've really earned this.
2544459	eng	You've piqued my interest.
2544460	eng	You've made a bad mistake.
2544461	eng	You've got to concentrate.
2544462	eng	You've disgraced yourself.
2544463	eng	You've been through a lot.
2544464	eng	You've been a great guest.
2544465	eng	You're not upset, are you?
2544466	eng	You're not tired, are you?
2544467	eng	You're not going, are you?
2544468	eng	You're not a teenager yet.
2544469	eng	You're asking for trouble.
2544470	eng	You're a good-looking guy.
2544471	eng	You're a good friend, Tom.
2544472	eng	You're a fantastic kisser.
2544473	eng	You would've loved Boston.
2544474	eng	You seem to be in a hurry.
2544475	eng	You know this is nonsense.
2544476	eng	You know nothing about me.
2544477	eng	You have to listen to Tom.
2544478	eng	You have to eat something.
2544479	eng	You have to ask Tom first.
2544480	eng	You have a job, don't you?
2544481	eng	You have a car, don't you?
2544482	eng	You don't love me, do you?
2544483	eng	Would you mind if we left?
2544484	eng	Why don't you take a walk?
2544485	eng	Why don't you read a book?
2544486	eng	Why doesn't Tom like Mary?
2544487	eng	Why do I have to help Tom?
2544488	eng	Why are you late to class?
2544489	eng	What's your mother's name?
2544490	eng	What's your father's name?
2544491	eng	What's Mary's maiden name?
2544492	eng	What are the alternatives?
2544493	eng	We're sorry for your loss.
2544494	eng	We're conducting a survey.
2544495	eng	We'll be here for a while.
2544496	eng	We weren't doing anything.
2544497	eng	We haven't officially met.
2544498	eng	We don't need Tom anymore.
2544499	eng	We do everything together.

2544506	eng	Tom, you've got to get up.
2544507	eng	Tom yelled over the noise.

2544685	eng	I'm running out of energy.
2544686	eng	I'm running a little late.
2544687	eng	I'm real upset about that.
2544688	eng	I'm pretty sure it's true.

2544798	eng	I'm glad that you're here.
2544799	eng	I'm glad I could help out.
2544800	eng	I'm getting tired of this.
2544801	eng	I'm flying back to Boston.
2544802	eng	I'm done with all of that.
2544803	eng	I'm done listening to you.
2544804	eng	I'm delighted to meet you.
2544805	eng	I'm cutting my trip short.
2544806	eng	I'm considering resigning.
2544807	eng	I'm calling Tom right now.
2544808	eng	I'm bringing home a pizza.
2544809	eng	I'm being honest with you.
2544810	eng	I'm at the end of my rope.
2544811	eng	I'm asking what you think.
2544812	eng	I'm as shocked as you are.
2544813	eng	I'm as curious as you are.
2544814	eng	I'm afraid Tom isn't here.
2544815	eng	I'm afraid I may hurt Tom.
2544816	eng	I'm a pretty good swimmer.
2544817	eng	I'm a pretty good student.
2544818	eng	I'm a little disappointed.
2544819	eng	I'll walk you to the gate.
2544820	eng	I'll try to remember that.
2544821	eng	I'll try to keep it short.
2544822	eng	I'll try to distract them.
2544823	eng	I'll text you the address.
2544824	eng	I'll tell you what to say.
2544825	eng	I'll tell you what I know.
2544826	eng	I'll tell Tom you're here.
2544827	eng	I'll tell Tom you said so.
2544828	eng	I'll tell Tom you came by.
2544829	eng	I'll talk to you tomorrow.
2544830	eng	I'll talk to Tom about it.
2544831	eng	I'll take care of you all.
2544832	eng	I'll take care of the cat.
2544833	eng	I'll take care of it, Tom.
2544834	eng	I'll stay out of your way.
2544835	eng	I'll stay a few more days.
2544836	eng	I'll show you where it is.
2544837	eng	I'll show you the way out.
2544838	eng	I'll see you at the party.
2544839	eng	I'll see what is possible.
2544840	eng	I'll see to it right away.
2544841	eng	I'll say it one more time.
2544842	eng	I'll never understand you.
2544843	eng	I'll never leave you, Tom.
2544844	eng	I'll never be that famous.
2544845	eng	I'll need you to be there.
2544846	eng	I'll make you some coffee.
2544847	eng	I'll make you proud of me.
2544848	eng	I'll make a pot of coffee.
2544849	eng	I'll let you speak to Tom.
2544850	eng	I'll leave that up to you.
2544851	eng	I'll kill the both of you.
2544852	eng	I'll just get you started.
2544853	eng	I'll join you there later.
2544854	eng	I'll join you in a moment.
2544855	eng	I'll introduce you to Tom.
2544856	eng	I'll hit Tom if I have to.
2544857	eng	I'll have to do it myself.
2544858	eng	I'll hang onto it for now.
2544859	eng	I'll go with Tom and Mary.
2544860	eng	I'll go take a shower now.
2544861	eng	I'll go anywhere you want.
2544862	eng	I'll go and get your coat.
2544863	eng	I'll give you a lift home.
2544864	eng	I'll give Tom the message.
2544865	eng	I'll give it my best shot.
2544866	eng	I'll fix you a cup of tea.
2544867	eng	I'll find out soon enough.
2544868	eng	I'll find my own way back.
2544869	eng	I'll explain it all later.
2544870	eng	I'll do whatever you want.
2544871	eng	I'll do whatever it takes.
2544872	eng	I'll do what must be done.
2544873	eng	I'll do it in the morning.
2544874	eng	I'll do anything you wish.
2544875	eng	I'll deal with Tom myself.
2544876	eng	I'll check with you later.
2544877	eng	I'll catch the next train.
2544878	eng	I'll catch the next plane.
2544879	eng	I'll call you after lunch.
2544880	eng	I'll borrow us some tools.
2544881	eng	I'll be with you in a sec.
2544882	eng	I'll be with Tom and Mary.
2544883	eng	I'll be waiting out front.
2544884	eng	I'll be there in a second.
2544885	eng	I'll be ready in a second.
2544886	eng	I'll be in the other room.
2544887	eng	I'll be back in my office.
2544888	eng	I'll be at the front door.
2544889	eng	I'll be as quick as I can.
2544890	eng	I'll be along in a minute.
2544891	eng	I'll arrange that for you.
2544892	eng	I'll answer that question.
2544893	eng	I'd take it if I were you.
2544894	eng	I'd really like to go now.
2544895	eng	I'd rather stay anonymous.
2544896	eng	I'd rather not go into it.
2544897	eng	I'd rather die than leave.
2544898	eng	I'd never let that happen.
2544899	eng	I'd make a good chaperone.
2544900	eng	I'd like for you to leave.
2544901	eng	I'd better go talk to Tom.
2544902	eng	I'd better call Tom first.
2544903	eng	I'd better call Tom again.
2544904	eng	I'd be willing to pay you.
2544905	eng	I wouldn't worry about it.
2544906	eng	I wouldn't try that again.
2544907	eng	I wouldn't recommend that.
2544908	eng	I wouldn't change a thing.
2544909	eng	I would've sent Tom money.
2544910	eng	I would advise against it.
2544911	eng	I work out whenever I can.
2544912	eng	I work at the post office.
2544913	eng	I wondered where Tom went.
2544914	eng	I wonder why Tom was late.
2544915	eng	I wonder who this is from.
2544916	eng	I wonder what Tom's doing.
2544917	eng	I wonder what Tom will do.
2544918	eng	I wonder what it could be.
2544919	eng	I wonder what his name is.
2544920	eng	I wonder if you'd help us.
2544921	eng	I wonder if we could talk.
2544922	eng	I wonder if we can get in.
2544923	eng	I wonder if this is wrong.
2544924	eng	I wonder how Tom is doing.
2544925	eng	I won't obey those orders.
2544926	eng	I won't let you ruin this.
2544927	eng	I won't leave without Tom.
2544928	eng	I woke up with a headache.
2544929	eng	I withdrew my application.
2544930	eng	I wish you'd called first.
2544931	eng	I wish you hadn't told me.
2544932	eng	I wish we could live here.
2544933	eng	I wish Tom were here, too.
2544934	eng	I wish Tom had known that.
2544935	eng	I wish that were the case.
2544936	eng	I wish I weren't Canadian.
2544937	eng	I wish I knew who Tom was.
2544938	eng	I wish I knew what to say.
2544939	eng	I wish I knew what it was.
2544940	eng	I wish I had Tom's brains.
2544941	eng	I wish I could explain it.
2544942	eng	I went to Tom's apartment.
2544943	eng	I went to Boston with Tom.
2544944	eng	I went out with Mary once.
2544945	eng	I watched the whole thing.
2544946	eng	I wasn't really listening.
2544947	eng	I wasn't paying attention.
2544948	eng	I wasn't informed of this.
2544949	eng	I wasn't going to give up.
2544950	eng	I wasn't cooking anything.
2544951	eng	I was with Tom last night.
2544952	eng	I was trying to reach you.
2544953	eng	I was told to contact you.
2544954	eng	I was there the other day.
2544955	eng	I was struck by lightning.
2544956	eng	I was meaning to call you.
2544957	eng	I was knocked unconscious.
2544958	eng	I was just talking to Tom.
2544959	eng	I was just messing around.
2544960	eng	I was just here yesterday.
2544961	eng	I was just fooling around.
2544962	eng	I was in pretty bad shape.
2544963	eng	I was in my room studying.
2544964	eng	I was gone for 45 minutes.
2544965	eng	I was going to take a nap.
2544966	eng	I was eventually released.
2544967	eng	I was as surprised as you.
2544968	eng	I was a fool to trust Tom.
2544969	eng	I want to see how it ends.
2544970	eng	I want to get to know Tom.
2544971	eng	I want to change my shirt.
2544972	eng	I want the absolute truth.
2544973	eng	I usually get what I want.
2544974	eng	I used to like folk music.
2544975	eng	I used to be fat like you.
2544976	eng	I understood it perfectly.
2544977	eng	I understand your reasons.
2544978	eng	I understand your dilemma.
2544979	eng	I understand how you felt.
2544980	eng	I underestimated you, Tom.
2544981	eng	I turned thirty last week.
2544982	eng	I tried to do all I could.
2544983	eng	I trained Tom for the job.
2544984	eng	I took care of it for you.
2544985	eng	I told you you'd like Tom.
2544986	eng	I told you Tom would come.
2544987	eng	I told you I'm not hungry.
2544988	eng	I told Tom you were happy.
2544989	eng	I told Tom to wait for me.
2544990	eng	I told Tom not to give up.
2544991	eng	I told Tom not to do this.
2544992	eng	I told Tom not to do that.
2544993	eng	I told Tom it wasn't mine.
2544994	eng	I told Tom I could handle it.
2544995	eng	I told Tom he was in trouble.
2544996	eng	I thought you'd never ask.
2544997	eng	I thought you were taller.
2544998	eng	I thought we were friends.
2544999	eng	I thought we should leave.
2545000	eng	I thought Tom had my back.
2545001	eng	I thought they'd heard us.
2545002	eng	I thought I'd be too late.
2545003	eng	I thought I was too young.
2545004	eng	I thought I heard a voice.
2545005	eng	I shouldn't have slept in.
2545006	eng	I picked Tom up at school.
2545007	eng	I need a receipt for that.
2545008	eng	I know that Mary loves me.
2545009	eng	I hope this isn't a dream.
2545010	eng	I feel tired all the time.
2545011	eng	I don't want to live here.
2545012	eng	I didn't prepare a speech.
2545013	eng	I can be there in an hour.
2545014	eng	I asked for some time off.
2545015	eng	Don't you have an opinion?
2545016	eng	Do you like the food here?
2545017	eng	Do you know what to bring?
2545018	eng	Do you have any sunscreen?
2545019	eng	Do you have a few minutes?
2545020	eng	Could you show me the way?
2545021	eng	Could I borrow your ruler?
2545022	eng	Business is very good now.
2545023	eng	Beautiful night, isn't it?
2545024	eng	Are you worried about Tom?
2545025	eng	Are you going to tell Tom?
2545026	eng	Are you feeling all right?
2545027	eng	Are you asking my opinion?
2545028	eng	Are you a friend of Tom's?
2545029	eng	Are there any more donuts?
2545030	eng	Am I making you nervous?
2545031	eng	You've slept a long time.
2545032	eng	You've helped us so much.
2545033	eng	You've got to believe me.
2545034	eng	You've got the advantage.
2545035	eng	You've come just in time.
2545036	eng	You've been holding back.
2545037	eng	You've already got a job.
2545038	eng	You're worrying too much.
2545039	eng	You're very good at this.
2545040	eng	You're tired, aren't you?
2545041	eng	You're taking a big risk.
2545042	eng	You're not my girlfriend.
2545043	eng	You're not lost, are you?
2545044	eng	You're not hurt, are you?
2545045	eng	You're not a kid anymore.
2545046	eng	You're joking, of course.
2545047	eng	You're breaking my heart.
2545048	eng	You're a horrible person.
2545049	eng	You're a grown woman now.
2545050	eng	You'll be very impressed.
2545051	eng	You won't be on your own.
2545053	eng	You really ought to quit.
2545054	eng	You need to listen to us.
2545055	eng	You have to listen to me.
2545056	eng	You have thirty messages.
2545057	eng	You have no other choice.
2545058	eng	You have my support, Tom.
2545059	eng	You have my respect, Tom.
2545060	eng	You got the answer right.
2545061	eng	You are lost, aren't you?
2545062	eng	You are in love with him.
2545063	eng	Would you pass the salad?
2545064	eng	Would you come over here?
2545065	eng	Why don't you take a nap?
2545066	eng	Why don't people like me?
2545067	eng	What are the differences?
2545068	eng	We've wasted enough time.
2545069	eng	We're very happy for you.
2545070	eng	We're on the wrong train.
2545071	eng	We're late for the dance.
2545072	eng	We're having a good time.
2545073	eng	We're friends, aren't we?
2545074	eng	We're brother and sister.
2545075	eng	We're all Canadians here.
2545076	eng	We'll work on that first.
2545077	eng	We'll be late for dinner.
2545078	eng	We have very little time.

2545885	eng	I'm taking it seriously.
2545886	eng	I'm sure you're correct.
2545887	eng	I'm sure you'll succeed.
2545888	eng	I'm sure you'll recover.
2545889	eng	I'm sure you'll do well.
2545890	eng	I'm sure you'll do fine.
2545891	eng	I'm sure you'll be fine.
2545892	eng	I'm sure you understand.
2545893	eng	I'm sure you meant that.
2545894	eng	I'm sure Tom will be OK.
2545895	eng	I'm sure Tom will agree.
2545896	eng	I'm sure Tom was sleepy.
2545897	eng	I'm sure Tom means well.
2545898	eng	I'm sure it wasn't easy.
2545899	eng	I'm sure I can help you.
2545900	eng	I'm sure I can find Tom.
2545901	eng	I'm supposed to do that.
2545902	eng	I'm such a blabbermouth.
2545903	eng	I'm still the boss here.
2545904	eng	I'm still not ready yet.
2545905	eng	I'm still not buying it.
2545906	eng	I'm still kind of tired.
2545907	eng	I'm standing right here.
2545908	eng	I'm sorry, I can't help.
2545909	eng	I'm sorry you got fired.
2545910	eng	I'm sorry if I hurt you.
2545911	eng	I'm sorry I was so mean.
2545912	eng	I'm sorry I lied to you.
2545913	eng	I'm sorry I doubted you.
2545914	eng	I'm sorry for your loss.
2545915	eng	I'm sorry for the delay.
2545916	eng	I'm so glad you've come.
2545917	eng	I'm so glad you're here.
2545918	eng	I'm so glad you like it.
2545919	eng	I'm sitting next to Tom.
2545920	eng	I'm simply doing my job.
2545921	eng	I'm seeing a trend here.
2545922	eng	I'm saying I'm not sure.
2545923	eng	I'm running out of time.
2545924	eng	I'm returning your call.
2545925	eng	I'm resigning on Monday.
2545926	eng	I'm quite aware of that.
2545927	eng	I'm proud of all of you.
2545928	eng	I'm pretty good at math.
2545929	eng	I'm pleased you're here.
2545930	eng	I'm pleased you like it.
2545931	eng	I'm perfectly all right.
2545932	eng	I'm on my way to Boston.
2545933	eng	I'm on my way there now.
2545934	eng	I'm on my way back home.
2545935	eng	I'm on a tight schedule.
2545936	eng	I'm offering you a deal.
2545937	eng	I'm nowhere near thirty.
2545938	eng	I'm not your enemy, Tom.
2545939	eng	I'm not working tonight.
2545940	eng	I'm not wasting my time.
2545941	eng	I'm not to be disturbed.
2545942	eng	I'm not swallowing that.
2545943	eng	I'm not sure where I am.
2545944	eng	I'm not sure about that.
2545945	eng	I'm not suggesting that.
2545946	eng	I'm not so sure of that.
2545947	eng	I'm not so good at this.
2545948	eng	I'm not really that old.
2545949	eng	I'm not quite ready yet.
2545950	eng	I'm not quite done here.
2545951	eng	I'm not paying for this.
2545952	eng	I'm not in a party mood.
2545953	eng	I'm not hiding anything.
2545954	eng	I'm not good with names.
2545955	eng	I'm not going to get up.
2545956	eng	I'm not going to eat it.
2545957	eng	I'm not getting married.
2545958	eng	I'm not forgetting that.
2545959	eng	I'm not feeling so good.
2545960	eng	I'm not completely sure.
2545961	eng	I'm not coming with you.
2545962	eng	I'm not coming in today.
2545963	eng	I'm not coming home yet.
2545964	eng	I'm not buying anything.
2545965	eng	I'm not asking for much.
2545966	eng	I'm not all that hungry.
2545967	eng	I'm no longer depressed.
2545968	eng	I'm making some changes.
2545969	eng	I'm looking out for you.
2545970	eng	I'm looking out for Tom.
2545971	eng	I'm looking for answers.
2545972	eng	I'm just planning ahead.
2545973	eng	I'm just obeying orders.
2545974	eng	I'm just not interested.
2545975	eng	I'm just glad Tom is OK.
2545976	eng	I'm just glad it's over.
2545977	eng	I'm just about finished.
2545978	eng	I'm just a little woozy.
2545979	eng	I'm just a little tired.
2545980	eng	I'm in town on business.
2545981	eng	I'm in a bit of trouble.
2545982	eng	I'm honored to know you.
2545983	eng	I'm here with my family.
2545984	eng	I'm here to support Tom.
2545985	eng	I'm here to pick up Tom.
2545986	eng	I'm here to pick Tom up.
2545987	eng	I'm here if you need me.
2545988	eng	I'm here because of Tom.
2545989	eng	I'm having a rough week.
2545990	eng	I'm having a lot of fun.
2545991	eng	I'm having a great time.
2545992	eng	I'm going to the office.
2545993	eng	I'm going to take a cab.
2545994	eng	I'm going to sleep here.
2545995	eng	I'm going to report you.
2545996	eng	I'm going to need a wig.
2545997	eng	I'm going to go see Tom.
2545998	eng	I'm going to go get Tom.
2545999	eng	I'm going to go do that.
2546000	eng	I'm going to get my gun.
2546001	eng	I'm going to follow Tom.
2546002	eng	I'm going to do my best.
2546003	eng	I'm going straight home.

2546010	eng	I'm glad you stopped by.
2546011	eng	I'm glad you moved back.
2546012	eng	I'm glad you dropped by.
2546013	eng	I'm glad you asked that.
2546014	eng	I'm glad Tom enjoyed it.
2546015	eng	I'm glad that's settled.
2546016	eng	I'm glad I've found you.
2546017	eng	I'm glad I ran into you.
2546018	eng	I'm giving you a choice.
2546019	eng	I'm giving you a chance.
2546020	eng	I'm getting tired of it.
2546021	eng	I'm getting out of town.
2546022	eng	I'm getting out of here.
2546023	eng	I'm furious at you, Tom.
2546024	eng	I'm fully aware of that.
2546025	eng	I'm from the government.
2546026	eng	I'm feeling lucky today.
2546027	eng	I'm driving myself home.
2546028	eng	I'm concerned about you.
2546029	eng	I'm coming for you, Tom.
2546030	eng	I'm coming back tonight.
2546031	eng	I'm coming back for you.
2546032	eng	I'm being held prisoner.
2546033	eng	I'm at the hospital now.
2546034	eng	I'm at the Hilton Hotel.
2546035	eng	I'm allergic to peanuts.
2546036	eng	I'm allergic to carrots.
2546037	eng	I'm afraid you're wrong.
2546038	eng	I'm afraid you're right.
2546039	eng	I'm afraid to interrupt.
2546040	eng	I'll wait right outside.
2546041	eng	I'll tell Tom you asked.
2546042	eng	I'll tell Tom the truth.
2546043	eng	I'll tell Tom right now.
2546044	eng	I'll take Tom to dinner.
2546045	eng	I'll take Tom some food.
2546046	eng	I'll take care of those.
2546047	eng	I'll take care of these.
2546048	eng	I'll take a look around.
2546049	eng	I'll stay and watch Tom.
2546050	eng	I'll set it up with Tom.
2546051	eng	I'll see you guys later.
2546052	eng	I'll see you again soon.
2546053	eng	I'll see you after work.
2546054	eng	I'll put it on your tab.
2546055	eng	I'll put it on the list.
2546056	eng	I'll only slow you down.
2546057	eng	I'll never work for you.
2546058	eng	I'll never work for Tom.
2546059	eng	I'll need some supplies.
2546060	eng	I'll need a few minutes.
2546061	eng	I'll meet you out front.
2546062	eng	I'll meet Tom in Boston.
2546063	eng	I'll make a reservation.
2546064	eng	I'll let everybody know.
2546065	eng	I'll keep an eye on Tom.
2546066	eng	I'll join you all later.
2546067	eng	I'll help any way I can.
2546068	eng	I'll have to ask around.
2546069	eng	I'll handle things here.
2546070	eng	I'll guard the prisoner.
2546071	eng	I'll go tell the others.
2546072	eng	I'll go talk to Tom now.
2546073	eng	I'll go home and get it.
2546074	eng	I'll go back and get it.
2546075	eng	I'll go and talk to Tom.
2546076	eng	I'll go along with that.
2546077	eng	I'll give you a new one.
2546078	eng	I'll get you some water.
2546079	eng	I'll get us some drinks.
2546080	eng	I'll get us some coffee.
2546081	eng	I'll get Tom right away.
2546082	eng	I'll get the hang of it.
2546083	eng	I'll get dinner started.
2546084	eng	I'll fix us some coffee.
2546085	eng	I'll find out who he is.
2546086	eng	I'll draw a map for you.
2546087	eng	I'll do it if I have to.
2546088	eng	I'll do better tomorrow.
2546089	eng	I'll do all the talking.
2546090	eng	I'll deal with it later.
2546091	eng	I'll come see you later.
2546092	eng	I'll come back tomorrow.
2546093	eng	I'll catch the next bus.
2546094	eng	I'll buy the next round.
2546095	eng	I'll be waiting outside.
2546096	eng	I'll be sure to do that.
2546097	eng	I'll be out in a second.
2546098	eng	I'll be out in a moment.
2546099	eng	I'll be out in a minute.
2546100	eng	I'll be leaving shortly.
2546101	eng	I'll be in the basement.
2546102	eng	I'll be glad to do that.
2546103	eng	I'll be counting on you.
2546104	eng	I'll be better tomorrow.
2546105	eng	I'll be back in a month.
2546106	eng	I'll be at the hospital.
2546107	eng	I'll ask Tom to help me.
2546108	eng	I'll ask for directions.
2546109	eng	I'd say that's accurate.
2546110	eng	I'd really like to know.
2546111	eng	I'd really like to help.
2546112	eng	I'd rather take the bus.
2546113	eng	I'd rather not touch it.
2546114	eng	I'd rather do it myself.
2546115	eng	I'd love a slice of pie.
2546116	eng	I'd like nothing better.
2546117	eng	I'd known Tom for years.
2546118	eng	I'd heard you'd changed.
2546119	eng	I'd have waited for you.
2546120	eng	I'd have figured it out.
2546121	eng	I'd follow Tom anywhere.
2546122	eng	I'd do anything for Tom.
2546123	eng	I'd be crazy to do that.
2546124	eng	I wrote that down wrong.
2546125	eng	I wouldn't recommend it.
2546126	eng	I wouldn't be surprised.
2546127	eng	I work in this building.
2546128	eng	I work at a gas station.
2546129	eng	I wonder who left these.
2546130	eng	I wonder where Tom went.
2546131	eng	I wonder what Tom wants.
2546132	eng	I wonder what Tom meant.
2546133	eng	I wonder how this works.
2546134	eng	I wonder how that works.
2546135	eng	I won't need it anymore.
2546136	eng	I won't let you do that.
2546137	eng	I wish you'd been there.
2546138	eng	I wish we could ask Tom.
2546139	eng	I wish it wasn't so hot.
2546140	eng	I wish I'd known sooner.
2546141	eng	I wish I could tell you.
2546142	eng	I wish I could prove it.
2546143	eng	I went out to find food.
2546144	eng	I wasn't planning on it.
2546145	eng	I wasn't here last year.
2546146	eng	I wasn't doing anything.
2546147	eng	I was worried about Tom.
2546148	eng	I was up half the night.
2546149	eng	I was up all night, too.
2546150	eng	I was trying to be nice.
2546151	eng	I was told Tom was dead.
2546152	eng	I was told Tom ran away.
2546153	eng	I was thinking about it.
2546154	eng	I was the only one left.
2546155	eng	I was talking about you.
2546156	eng	I was talking about Tom.
2546157	eng	I was swamped with work.
2546158	eng	I was starting to worry.
2546159	eng	I was so busy last week.
2546160	eng	I was only gone an hour.
2546161	eng	I was just doing my job.
2546162	eng	I was just being polite.
2546163	eng	I was in the front seat.
2546164	eng	I was in a car accident.
2546165	eng	I was hoping you'd know.
2546166	eng	I was going to call Tom.
2546167	eng	I was given this ticket.
2546168	eng	I was following a hunch.
2546169	eng	I was feeling nostalgic.
2546170	eng	I was completely fooled.
2546171	eng	I was chosen to do that.
2546172	eng	I was born in Australia.
2546173	eng	I was born a year later.
2546174	eng	I was asked to be quiet.
2546175	eng	I was asked here by Tom.
2546176	eng	I was about to head out.
2546177	eng	I was a science teacher.
2546178	eng	I warned Tom about Mary.
2546179	eng	I want you to bring Tom.
2546180	eng	I want to hear about it.
2546181	eng	I want to come with you.
2546182	eng	I used to work with Tom.
2546183	eng	I used to be a gardener.
2546184	eng	I understand it all now.
2546185	eng	I turned down the offer.
2546186	eng	I trust Tom's instincts.
2546187	eng	I took a big risk today.
2546188	eng	I told you to stay back.
2546189	eng	I told you to stay away.
2546190	eng	I told you to keep away.
2546191	eng	I told you not to worry.
2546192	eng	I told you I'd help you.
2546193	eng	I told you I have plans.
2546194	eng	I told Tom what I think.
2546195	eng	I told Tom to stay here.
2546196	eng	I told Tom I was coming.
2546197	eng	I told Tom he should go.
2546198	eng	I threw it in the river.
2546199	eng	I thought you were done.
2546200	eng	I thought you said 2:30.
2546201	eng	I thought you needed it.
2546202	eng	I thought you loved Tom.
2546203	eng	I thought you knew that.
2546204	eng	I thought you had to go.
2546205	eng	I thought you had plans.
2546206	eng	I thought Tom was great.
2546207	eng	I thought Tom was funny.
2546208	eng	I thought this was over.
2546209	eng	I thought Mary loved me.
2546210	eng	I thought it would last.
2546211	eng	I thought I was too old.
2546212	eng	I thought everyone knew.
2546213	eng	I put in for a transfer.
2546214	eng	I need to get groceries.
2546215	eng	I know that Tom is busy.
2546216	eng	I keep bumping into you.
2546217	eng	I have to wash my hands.
2546218	eng	I have nothing you want.
2546219	eng	I don't think Tom cares.
2546220	eng	I can't stay home today.
2546221	eng	I can't do it by myself.
2546222	eng	I appreciate your offer.
2546223	eng	Hey, where're you going?
2546224	eng	Do you know what we did?
2546225	eng	Ask me anything anytime.
2546226	eng	Are you sure that's all?
2546227	eng	Are you here to help me?
2546228	eng	You've run out of time.
2546229	eng	You've been very quiet.
2546230	eng	You've been good to us.
2546231	eng	You're wrong, you know.
2546232	eng	You're wrong, as usual.
2546233	eng	You're wrong about Tom.
2546234	eng	You're worse than I am.
2546235	eng	You're welcome to stay.
2546236	eng	You're very persuasive.
2546237	eng	You're not bad looking.
2546238	eng	You're not bad at this.
2546239	eng	You're good at drawing.
2546240	eng	You're a good waitress.
2546241	eng	You're a good listener.
2546242	eng	You're a good kid, Tom.
2546243	eng	You're a good boy, Tom.
2546244	eng	You're a celebrity now.
2546245	eng	You're a big help, Tom.
2546246	eng	You're a bad influence.
2546247	eng	You'll have no problem.
2546248	eng	You'll catch pneumonia.
2546249	eng	You would've liked Tom.
2546250	eng	You weren't that great.
2546251	eng	You were totally right.
2546252	eng	You were so young then.
2546253	eng	You missed the meeting.
2546254	eng	You know this is wrong.
2546255	eng	You have what you need.
2546256	eng	You have to be kidding!
2546257	eng	You have my permission.
2546258	eng	You have a good lawyer.
2546259	eng	You have a big problem.
2546260	eng	You forgot your change.
2546261	eng	You always have a plan.
2546262	eng	Would you stop, please?
2546263	eng	Will you give me a job?
2546264	eng	Why should I get a dog?
2546265	eng	Why don't you watch TV?
2546266	eng	Why are you dressed up?
2546267	eng	Who wrote this article?
2546268	eng	Who are the kidnappers?
2546269	eng	Where did you leave it?
2546270	eng	Where are Tom and Mary?
2546271	eng	Where are the diamonds?
2546272	eng	What's your dog's name?
2546273	eng	What's behind the door?
2546274	eng	What was the diagnosis?
2546275	eng	We're watching a movie.
2546276	eng	We're out of here, Tom.

2547100	eng	I'm the only one left.
2547101	eng	I'm the only one here.
2547102	eng	I'm the one they want.
2547103	eng	I'm talking to myself.
2547104	eng	I'm taking it with me.
2547105	eng	I'm taking a vacation.
2547106	eng	I'm sure you're wrong.
2547107	eng	I'm sure we all agree.
2547108	eng	I'm sure Tom was busy.
2547109	eng	I'm sure Tom told you.
2547110	eng	I'm sure Tom is wrong.
2547111	eng	I'm sure Tom is right.
2547112	eng	I'm sure that's wrong.
2547113	eng	I'm sure that's right.
2547114	eng	I'm sure that'll help.
2547115	eng	I'm sure that was Tom.
2547116	eng	I'm sure it's nothing.
2547117	eng	I'm still very scared.
2547118	eng	I'm still in training.
2547119	eng	I'm still in mourning.
2547120	eng	I'm sticking with Tom.
2547121	eng	I'm staying out of it.
2547122	eng	I'm starting to worry.
2547123	eng	I'm starting to relax.
2547124	eng	I'm sorry you're sick.
2547125	eng	I'm sorry I said that.
2547126	eng	I'm so glad you're OK.
2547127	eng	I'm sick of this game.
2547128	eng	I'm serious this time.
2547129	eng	I'm scared of heights.
2547130	eng	I'm sad to see you go.
2547131	eng	I'm right on this one.
2547132	eng	I'm really mad at you.
2547133	eng	I'm really mad at Tom.
2547134	eng	I'm really bummed out.
2547135	eng	I'm ready for Tom now.
2547136	eng	I'm proud of you, Tom.
2547137	eng	I'm proud of you guys.
2547138	eng	I'm prepared for that.
2547139	eng	I'm parked over there.
2547140	eng	I'm out of place here.
2547141	eng	I'm open to new ideas.
2547142	eng	I'm on your side, Tom.
2547143	eng	I'm older than I look.
2547144	eng	I'm offering you work.
2547145	eng	I'm off work tomorrow.
2547146	eng	I'm not young anymore.
2547147	eng	I'm not wearing socks.
2547148	eng	I'm not usually wrong.
2547149	eng	I'm not unsympathetic.
2547150	eng	I'm not sure I get it.
2547151	eng	I'm not sleeping well.
2547152	eng	I'm not scared of you.
2547153	eng	I'm not paying for it.
2547154	eng	I'm not on Tom's team.
2547155	eng	I'm not on duty today.
2547156	eng	I'm not in any danger.
2547157	eng	I'm not hungry either.
2547158	eng	I'm not hungry anyway.
2547159	eng	I'm not going to work.
2547160	eng	I'm not going to wait.
2547161	eng	I'm not going to talk.
2547162	eng	I'm not going to stop.
2547163	eng	I'm not going to lose.
2547164	eng	I'm not going to look.
2547165	eng	I'm not going outside.
2547166	eng	I'm not following you.
2547167	eng	I'm not done deciding.
2547168	eng	I'm not as bad as Tom.
2547169	eng	I'm not angry anymore.
2547170	eng	I'm not an only child.
2547171	eng	I'm not afraid to try.
2547172	eng	I'm not afraid to die.
2547173	eng	I'm not a patient man.
2547174	eng	I'm not a kid anymore.
2547175	eng	I'm not a drug addict.
2547176	eng	I'm lucky to be alive.
2547177	eng	I'm leaving right now.
2547178	eng	I'm leaving in a week.
2547179	eng	I'm late for practice.
2547180	eng	I'm just finishing up.
2547181	eng	I'm just feeling down.
2547182	eng	I'm just being polite.
2547183	eng	I'm joking, of course.
2547184	eng	I'm inclined to agree.
2547185	eng	I'm in perfect health.
2547186	eng	I'm in love with Mary.
2547187	eng	I'm home all the time.
2547188	eng	I'm here for you, Tom.
2547189	eng	I'm here all the time.
2547190	eng	I'm helping out today.
2547191	eng	I'm heading there now.
2547192	eng	I'm heading back home.
2547193	eng	I'm grateful for that.
2547194	eng	I'm going to work now.
2547195	eng	I'm going to win this.
2547196	eng	I'm going to watch TV.
2547197	eng	I'm going to throw up.
2547198	eng	I'm going to tell Tom.
2547199	eng	I'm going to take off.
2547200	eng	I'm going to stop you.
2547201	eng	I'm going to lie down.
2547202	eng	I'm going to hurt you.
2547203	eng	I'm going to help you.
2547204	eng	I'm going to help Tom.
2547205	eng	I'm going to go shave.
2547206	eng	I'm going to go check.
2547207	eng	I'm going to get help.
2547208	eng	I'm going to be on TV.
2547209	eng	I'm going on vacation.
2547210	eng	I'm going back to bed.
2547211	eng	I'm glad you're early.
2547212	eng	I'm glad you think so.
2547213	eng	I'm glad you remember.
2547214	eng	I'm glad you like Tom.
2547215	eng	I'm glad we found you.
2547216	eng	I'm glad we came here.
2547217	eng	I'm glad Tom has gone.
2547218	eng	I'm glad it wasn't me.
2547219	eng	I'm glad I was nearby.
2547220	eng	I'm glad I caught you.
2547221	eng	I'm giving you a ride.
2547222	eng	I'm from a big family.
2547223	eng	I'm dying to meet Tom.
2547224	eng	I'm doing you a favor.
2547225	eng	I'm coming to get you.
2547226	eng	I'm calling Tom again.
2547227	eng	I'm calling my lawyer.
2547228	eng	I'm bored with Boston.
2547229	eng	I'm being a gentleman.
2547230	eng	I'm aware of all that.
2547231	eng	I'm attracted to Mary.
2547232	eng	I'm at the restaurant.
2547233	eng	I'm at the north gate.
2547234	eng	I'm almost sure of it.
2547235	eng	I'm afraid to go home.
2547236	eng	I'm afraid of nothing.
2547237	eng	I'm a lousy fisherman.
2547238	eng	I'm a little shook up.
2547239	eng	I'll write you a note.
2547240	eng	I'll try to reach Tom.
2547241	eng	I'll think about that.
2547242	eng	I'll talk to you soon.
2547243	eng	I'll take Tom to Mary.
2547244	eng	I'll take this to Tom.
2547245	eng	I'll take that chance.
2547246	eng	I'll take care of Tom.
2547247	eng	I'll stop by tomorrow.
2547248	eng	I'll stay up with you.
2547249	eng	I'll stay if you want.
2547250	eng	I'll show Tom the way.
2547251	eng	I'll shine your shoes.
2547252	eng	I'll send you my bill.
2547253	eng	I'll send word to Tom.
2547254	eng	I'll see you upstairs.
2547255	eng	I'll see you soon, OK?
2547256	eng	I'll see you at lunch.
2547257	eng	I'll see if Tom is up.
2547258	eng	I'll only talk to Tom.
2547259	eng	I'll only be a second.
2547260	eng	I'll only be a moment.
2547261	eng	I'll only be a minute.
2547262	eng	I'll never lie to you.
2547263	eng	I'll make some dinner.
2547264	eng	I'll let Tom tell you.
2547265	eng	I'll leave right away.
2547266	eng	I'll keep you updated.
2547267	eng	I'll keep you advised.
2547268	eng	I'll keep it a secret.
2547269	eng	I'll just get my keys.
2547270	eng	I'll just get my coat.
2547271	eng	I'll join you shortly.
2547272	eng	I'll help you with it.
2547273	eng	I'll help you do that.
2547274	eng	I'll have to tell Tom.
2547275	eng	I'll go if you insist.
2547276	eng	I'll get to the point.
2547277	eng	I'll get them for you.
2547278	eng	I'll get that for you.
2547279	eng	I'll get around to it.
2547280	eng	I'll get a second job.
2547281	eng	I'll get a fire going.
2547282	eng	I'll find Tom for you.
2547283	eng	I'll find out for you.
2547284	eng	I'll find another one.
2547285	eng	I'll explain it again.
2547286	eng	I'll do what you want.
2547287	eng	I'll do what I please.
2547288	eng	I'll do that tomorrow.
2547289	eng	I'll do no such thing.
2547290	eng	I'll consult with Tom.
2547291	eng	I'll check it for you.
2547292	eng	I'll change my flight.
2547293	eng	I'll call Tom for you.
2547294	eng	I'll bring Tom to you.
2547295	eng	I'll be your roommate.
2547296	eng	I'll be there shortly.
2547297	eng	I'll be there for you.
2547298	eng	I'll be there by 2:30.
2547299	eng	I'll be there all day.
2547300	eng	I'll be right in here.
2547301	eng	I'll be in the office.
2547302	eng	I'll be in my trailer.
2547303	eng	I'll be back in a sec.
2547304	eng	I'll apologize to Tom.
2547305	eng	I'd think it'd be fun.
2547306	eng	I'd still like to try.
2547307	eng	I'd say you got taken.
2547308	eng	I'd say you earned it.
2547309	eng	I'd rather be fishing.
2547310	eng	I'd never dream of it.
2547311	eng	I'd like to cooperate.
2547312	eng	I'd like nothing more.
2547313	eng	I'd like not to do it.
2547314	eng	I'd know you anywhere.
2547315	eng	I'd heard you'd moved.
2547316	eng	I'd feel the same way.
2547317	eng	I'd double-check that.
2547318	eng	I'd do the same thing.
2547319	eng	I'd better get moving.
2547320	eng	I'd be willing to pay.
2547321	eng	I'd advise doing that.
2547322	eng	I'd advise against it.
2547323	eng	I wrote Mary a letter.
2547324	eng	I wouldn't touch that.
2547325	eng	I wouldn't lie to you.
2547326	eng	I wouldn't blame them.
2547327	eng	I wouldn't be so sure.
2547328	eng	I wouldn't allow that.
2547329	eng	I would've sent roses.
2547330	eng	I work at the airport.
2547331	eng	I wonder where Tom is.
2547332	eng	I wonder what's wrong.
2547333	eng	I wonder what Tom saw.
2547334	eng	I wonder what this is.
2547335	eng	I won't let Tom do it.
2547336	eng	I won't agree to this.
2547337	eng	I won fair and square.
2547338	eng	I wish you'd call Tom.
2547339	eng	I wish you could stay.
2547340	eng	I wish Tom would stay.
2547341	eng	I wish to remain here.
2547342	eng	I wish I'd called Tom.
2547343	eng	I wish I'd been there.
2547344	eng	I went to the library.
2547345	eng	I went to talk to Tom.
2547346	eng	I went out for dinner.
2547347	eng	I wasn't overly tired.
2547348	eng	I wasn't on duty then.
2547349	eng	I wasn't in any hurry.
2547350	eng	I wasn't ignoring you.
2547351	eng	I wasn't feeling well.
2547352	eng	I wasn't avoiding you.
2547353	eng	I was wrong about you.
2547354	eng	I was wrong about Tom.
2547355	eng	I was told to come in.
2547356	eng	I was thinking of Tom.
2547357	eng	I was there for hours.
2547358	eng	I was surprised by it.
2547359	eng	I was scared to death.
2547360	eng	I was right all along.
2547361	eng	I was right about Tom.
2547362	eng	I was out celebrating.
2547363	eng	I was looking for you.
2547364	eng	I was looking for Tom.
2547365	eng	I was just tidying up.
2547366	eng	I was just passing by.
2547367	eng	I was just having fun.
2547368	eng	I was just a kid then.
2547369	eng	I was in the hospital.
2547370	eng	I was in my apartment.
2547371	eng	I was hoping for more.
2547372	eng	I was here last night.
2547373	eng	I was heavily sedated.
2547374	eng	I was happy back then.
2547375	eng	I was getting worried.
2547376	eng	I was fired last week.
2547377	eng	I was counting on you.
2547378	eng	I was chosen for that.
2547379	eng	I was being sarcastic.
2547380	eng	I was a little thrown.
2547381	eng	I want to see my kids.
2547382	eng	I used to be a dancer.
2547383	eng	I used to babysit Tom.
2547384	eng	I understand the risk.
2547385	eng	I understand that now.
2547386	eng	I turned the job down.
2547387	eng	I turned down the job.
2547388	eng	I tried to find a job.
2547389	eng	I told you to go away.
2547390	eng	I told Tom what to do.
2547391	eng	I told Tom what I saw.
2547392	eng	I told Tom to do that.
2547393	eng	I told Tom I was fine.
2547394	eng	I told Tom everything.
2547395	eng	I told Tom about Mary.
2547396	eng	I thought you knew me.
2547397	eng	I thought it'd be fun.
2547398	eng	I think I fell asleep.
2547399	eng	I remember this place.
2547400	eng	I rarely get visitors.
2547401	eng	I put it on the table.
2547402	eng	I missed the deadline.
2547403	eng	I miss Boston so much.
2547404	eng	I know where you were.
2547405	eng	I just don't like Tom.
2547406	eng	I had to go to Boston.
2547407	eng	I had a right to know.
2547408	eng	I don't need you here.
2547409	eng	I can't work any more.
2547410	eng	I bought this for Tom.
2547411	eng	How was the reception?
2547412	eng	How was the interview?
2547413	eng	How was the honeymoon?
2547414	eng	Hold the door, please.
2547415	eng	Great show, wasn't it?
2547416	eng	Forgive the intrusion.
2547417	eng	Everyone was so happy.
2547418	eng	Everyone was drinking.
2547419	eng	Everyone believed Tom.
2547420	eng	Do you want my advice?
2547421	eng	Do you need more time?
2547422	eng	Do you have any plans?
2547423	eng	Do you have a warrant?
2547424	eng	Do you have a voucher?
2547425	eng	Did you get a receipt?
2547426	eng	Are you going to wait?
2547427	eng	Are you going to help me?
2547428	eng	Are you ashamed of me?
2547429	eng	You've got to get up.
2547430	eng	You've done it right.
2547432	eng	You're not very tidy.
2547433	eng	You're not very good.
2547434	eng	You're not my friend.
2547435	eng	You're not in charge.
2547436	eng	You're not a suspect.
2547437	eng	You're in good shape.
2547438	eng	You're in good hands.
2547439	eng	You're back, are you?
2547440	eng	You're an hour early.
2547441	eng	You're almost thirty.
2547442	eng	You're all very calm.
2547443	eng	You're a teacher now.
2547444	eng	You're a soldier now.
2547445	eng	You're a prince, Tom.
2547446	eng	You're a little late.
2547447	eng	You're a good person.
2547448	eng	You're a good mother.
2547449	eng	You're a good kisser.
2547450	eng	You're a good dancer.
2547451	eng	You're a filthy liar.
2547452	eng	You're a brave woman.
2547453	eng	You'll have to leave.
2547454	eng	You'll have to drive.
2547455	eng	You'll be in trouble.
2547456	eng	You wouldn't do that.
2547457	eng	You wished to see me?
2547458	eng	You will be rewarded.
2547459	eng	You weren't that bad.
2547460	eng	You need supervision.
2547461	eng	You look very pretty.
2547462	eng	You know we love you.
2547463	eng	You have to try, Tom.
2547464	eng	You have bad manners.
2547465	eng	You can ride with me.
2547466	eng	You are what you are.
2547467	eng	You are very welcome.
2547468	eng	Would you cut it out?
2547469	eng	Why did you tell Tom?
2547470	eng	Who unplugged the TV?
2547471	eng	Where are the police?
2547472	eng	Where are the horses?
2547473	eng	What's in the closet?
2547474	eng	What're you watching?
2547475	eng	What're you planning?
2547476	eng	What was Tom's reply?
2547477	eng	We've figured it out.
2547478	eng	We're the new owners.
2547479	eng	We're still checking.
2547480	eng	We're sorting it out.
2547481	eng	We're out of options.
2547482	eng	We're out of bullets.
2547483	eng	We're not your enemy.
2547484	eng	We're an hour behind.
2547485	eng	We're about to start.
2547486	eng	We'll mail it to you.
2547487	eng	We were working late.
2547488	eng	We were under attack.
2547489	eng	We were really tight.
2547490	eng	We watch TV together.
2547491	eng	We met the other day.
2547492	eng	We know where Tom is.
2547493	eng	We know what we want.
2547494	eng	We have to surrender.
2547495	eng	We have fun together.
2547496	eng	We have an emergency.
2547497	eng	We have an advantage.
2547498	eng	We have a nice house.
2547499	eng	We all have problems.
2547500	eng	We all have families.
2547501	eng	Tom's voice was loud.
2547502	eng	Tom's very dangerous.

2566244	deu	Meine liebe Mutter.
2566245	deu	Wenn die Laster uns verlassen, schmeicheln wir uns mit dem Wahn, wir hätten sie verlassen.
2566246	deu	Die Launen unseres Gemüts sind noch seltsamer als die des Schicksals.
2566247	deu	Leidenschaft ist ungerecht und eigennützig und deshalb eine gefährliche Führerin, der man sich nicht anvertrauen soll, selbst wenn sie noch so vernünftig erscheint.
2566248	deu	Die Leidenschaften sind die einzigen Redner, die stets überreden. Sie sind gleichsam eine natürliche Kunst, deren Regeln nie irre führen, und der einfältigste Mensch,von Leidenschaften erfüllt, überredet besser als der beredteste ohne Leidenschaft.
2566249	deu	Im menschlichen Herzen liegt eine unzerstörbare Brut von Leidenschaften, und das Ende der einen ist fast immer der Anfang einer anderen.
2566250	deu	Es gibt keine Verstellung, die die Liebe, wo sie ist, lange verbergen oder, wo sie nicht ist, vortäuschen könnte.
2566251	deu	Beurteilt man die Liebe nach den meisten ihrer Wirkungen, so hat sie mehr vom Hass an sich als von der Freundschaft.
2566252	deu	Liebe kann, wie Feuer, nicht ohne ewige Bewegung bestehen, und sie hört auf zu leben, sobald sie zu hoffen und zu fürchten aufgehört hat.
2566253	deu	Mit der wahren Liebe ist es wie mit den Gespenstererscheinungen: Alle Welt spricht von ihnen, aber wenige haben sie gesehen.
2566254	deu	Es gibt kaum Menschen, die sich nicht schämen, einander geliebt zu haben, wenn sie sich nicht mehr lieben.
2566255	deu	List und Verrat entspringen nur aus einem Mangel an wirklicher Klugheit.
2566256	deu	Wir können uns unseres Mutes nicht sicher sein, solange wir uns nicht in Gefahr befunden haben.
2566257	deu	Die Jugend wechselt ihre Neigungen aus Heißblütigkeit, und das Alter bewahrt die seinen aus Gewohnheit.
2566258	deu	Selbst mit den verbrecherischsten Leidenschaften prahlt man zuweilen; nur der Neid ist eine scheue und verschämte, die man nie einzugestehen wagt.
2566259	deu	Die Philosophie besiegt leicht vergangene und zukünftige Übel, gegenwärtige aber besiegen sie.
2566260	deu	Oft genügt Primitivität, um gegen Schlauheit gefeit zu sein.
2566261	deu	Mit nichts ist man freigibiger als mit Ratschlägen.
2566262	deu	Es ist schwer zu beurteilen, ob ein reines, offenes, redliches Betragen aus Redlichkeit oder Klugheit entspringt.
2566263	deu	Wir reden wenig, wenn die Eitelkeit uns nicht reden macht.
2566264	deu	Reue ist oft nicht so sehr das Bedauern über das Böse, das wir getan haben, als die Furcht vor dem, was uns daraus erwachsen könnte.
2566265	dan	Jeg har lige gjort mit værelse rent.
