6664426	eng	I enjoy listening to the radio.
6664427	eng	Tom has never gone hunting.
6664428	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as amused by what's going on as Mary seems to be.
6664429	eng	I don't yet know what we'll do.
6664430	eng	I admitted I didn't do what Tom told me I had to do.
6664431	eng	Tom is self-conscious, but Mary isn't.
6664432	eng	I don't want to study medicine.
6664433	eng	I wish I could get Tom to stop doing that.
6664434	eng	I don't think Tom is home on Mondays.
6664435	eng	I don't want to stay in Boston.
6664436	eng	Tom got mad at me for doing that.
6664437	eng	Is this car Tom's?
6664438	eng	I don't want to see that movie.
6664439	eng	Tom has had another stroke.
6664440	eng	Tom has been so busy lately that he hasn't had time to hang out with us.
6664441	eng	I don't want to live on my own.
6664442	eng	I advised Tom to come back home as soon as he could.
6664443	eng	Tom is scared to death of his father.
6664444	eng	I don't want to join your club.
6664445	eng	I wish I could get Tom to quit doing that.
6664446	eng	I don't think Tom was being truthful.
6664447	eng	I don't want to be an engineer.
6664448	eng	Tom got mad at us for doing that.
6664449	eng	Is this bag Tom's?
6664450	eng	I don't usually dress this way.
6664451	eng	Tom grabbed his dog's tail.
6664452	eng	Tom tasted the cake Mary made and said he didn't like the way it tasted.
6664453	eng	I don't use salt in my cooking.
6664454	eng	I advised Tom to come back home as soon as possible.
6664455	eng	Tom is overconfident, but Mary isn't.
6664456	eng	I don't understand much French.
6664457	eng	I wish I could get Tom to do that with me.
6664458	eng	I don't think Tom was busy yesterday.
6664459	eng	I don't think that will happen.
6664460	eng	Tom got very famous very quickly.
6664461	eng	Is this Tom's hat?
6664462	eng	I don't think I'll get the job.
6664463	eng	Tom got stung by a jellyfish.
6664464	eng	Tom's birthday is coming up in a week and I don't know what to give him.
6664465	eng	I don't think I agree with you.
6664466	eng	I agreed to meet Tom in front of the school at 2:30.
6664467	eng	Tom is moving into a new house today.
6664468	eng	I don't speak French every day.
6664469	eng	I was surprised Tom couldn't speak French.
6664470	eng	I don't think Tom was careful enough.
6664471	eng	I don't really want to eat now.
6664472	eng	Tom had a pretty rough childhood.
6664473	eng	Is this Tom's dog?
6664474	eng	I don't often eat meat anymore.
6664475	eng	Tom got lost in the jungle.
6664476	eng	Tom's neighbors always complain about the noise whenever he has a party.
6664477	eng	I don't often drink white wine.
6664478	eng	I can't speak French. Tom can't speak French either.
6664479	eng	Tom is kind of old for you, isn't he?
6664480	eng	I don't need to work on Monday.
6664481	eng	I told Tom to take better care of himself.
6664482	eng	I don't think Tom was home on Monday.
6664483	eng	I don't necessarily have to go.
6664484	eng	Tom has been behaving like a kid.
6664485	eng	Is that car Tom's?
6664486	eng	I don't mind lending you money.
6664487	eng	Tom got friendly with Mary.
6664488	eng	I don't think I've ever heard either Tom or Mary complain about anything.
6664489	eng	I don't like to rely on others.
6664490	eng	I didn't know I wasn't supposed to help Tom do that.
6664491	eng	Tom is just trying to manipulate you.
6664492	eng	I don't like this kind of food.
6664493	eng	I told Tom not to leave his door unlocked.
6664494	eng	I don't think Tom will be successful.
6664495	eng	I don't like the way you dance.
6664496	eng	Tom has been married once before.
6664497	eng	Is that Tom's son?
6664498	eng	I don't like milk in my coffee.
6664499	eng	Tom got even more agitated.
6664500	eng	I'm the one who gave Tom the painting that's hanging above his fireplace.
6664501	eng	I don't like coffee with sugar.
6664502	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so desperate to do that.
6664503	eng	Tom is irreplaceable, but Mary isn't.
6664504	eng	I don't let my dog in my house.
6664505	eng	I told Tom not to buy Mary's old computer.
6664506	eng	I don't think Tom's plan is feasible.
6664507	eng	I don't know how to play chess.
6664508	eng	Tom has been placed on probation.
6664509	eng	Is that Tom's hat?
6664510	eng	I don't know how to milk a cow.
6664511	eng	Tom got drowsy after lunch.
6664512	eng	Just as Tom and I were about to start playing tennis, it started raining.
6664513	eng	I don't keep my room very tidy.
6664514	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so motivated to do that.
6664515	eng	Tom is interested in learning French.
6664516	eng	I don't have time to eat lunch.
6664517	eng	I should've advised Tom to keep it secret.
6664518	eng	I don't think that Tom is Mary's son.
6664519	eng	I don't have much energy today.
6664520	eng	Tom has been sleeping in his car.
6664521	eng	Is that Tom's dog?
6664522	eng	I don't have many weekends off.
6664523	eng	Tom got a little flustered.
6664524	eng	The teacher confiscated Tom's phone when she caught him texting in class.
6664525	eng	I don't have enough experience.
6664526	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so reluctant to do that.
6664527	eng	Tom is having a party Monday evening.
6664528	eng	I don't have any place to live.
6664529	eng	I have no idea where Tom wants to do that.
6664530	eng	I don't think what Tom said was true.
6664531	eng	I don't have a savings account.
6664532	eng	Tom has found another girlfriend.
6664533	eng	Is Tom busy today?
6664534	eng	I don't have a pressure cooker.
6664535	eng	Tom goes to school by bike.
6664536	eng	Tom and I didn't know that we were the ones who were supposed to do that.
6664537	eng	I don't have a high-paying job.
6664538	eng	I don't know how Tom and I are going to manage that.
6664539	eng	Tom is conscientious, but Mary isn't.
6664540	eng	I don't go skin diving anymore.
6664541	eng	I have no idea what Tom does for a living.
6664542	eng	I don't think that'll happen.
6664543	eng	I don't understand why Tom does that.
6664544	eng	I don't gamble, drink or smoke.
6664545	eng	Tom has had another heart attack.
6664546	eng	I'm divorcing Tom.
6664547	eng	I don't enjoy horseback riding.
6664548	eng	Tom doesn't get much sleep.
6664549	eng	Tom got a little worried when Mary didn't arrive when she said she would.
6664550	eng	I don't do that very regularly.
6664551	eng	I don't know if Tom will go with us tomorrow or not.
6664552	eng	Tom is coming home from Boston today.
6664553	eng	I don't do that at all anymore.
6664554	eng	I had another argument with Tom yesterday.
6664555	eng	I don't understand why Tom got angry.
6664556	eng	I don't do anything on Mondays.
6664557	eng	Tom has offered to drive us home.
6664558	eng	I loved Tom a lot.
6664559	eng	I don't consider myself a hero.
6664560	eng	Tom doesn't gamble anymore.
6664561	eng	Tom got fairly fluent in French after about three years of intense study.
6664562	eng	I didn't think I'd be so tired.
6664563	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't want Mary at his party.
6664564	eng	Tom is a member of the marching band.
6664565	eng	I didn't get paid much do that.
6664566	eng	I got tired of waiting for Tom, so I left.
6664567	eng	I don't want Tom to sing at my party.
6664568	eng	I didn't do all this by myself.
6664569	eng	Tom heard Mary shouting for help.
6664570	eng	I don't think Tom would do that by himself.
6664571	eng	I completed the work by myself.
6664572	eng	Tom didn't really know why.
6664573	eng	Tom left Mary in the car while he ran into the store to buy a dozen eggs.
6664574	eng	I can't tie my shoes by myself.
6664575	eng	I don't need to know why Tom didn't want to do that.
6664576	eng	Tom is a faster swimmer than Mary is.
6664577	eng	I can't think of a better plan.
6664578	eng	I got jealous when I saw Tom hugging Mary.
6664579	eng	I don't want to go anywhere with Tom.
6664580	eng	I can't sleep without a pillow.
6664581	eng	Tom heard a gun click behind him.
6664582	eng	Tom saw the fire.
6664583	eng	I can't seem to access my data.
6664584	eng	Tom didn't change anything.
6664585	eng	Tom said that he felt he wasn't doing everything he should've been doing.
6664586	eng	I can't remember my PIN number.
6664587	eng	I don't think I can convince Tom to stop doing that.
6664588	eng	Tom is a better teacher than Mary is.
6664589	eng	I can't pay my rent this month.
6664590	eng	I got angry when I saw what Tom was doing.
6664591	eng	I don't want to go shopping with Tom.
6664592	eng	I can't help you do that today.
6664593	eng	Tom helped me when I needed help.
6664594	eng	Tom loves rowing.
6664595	eng	I can't give you an answer yet.
6664596	eng	Tom could help you do that.
6664597	eng	Tom spent the evening watching a basketball game on TV with his children.
6664598	eng	I can't give you an answer now.
6664599	eng	I don't think I can do that any better than Tom can.
6664600	eng	Tom is a better student than Mary is.
6664601	eng	I almost opened the wrong door.
6664602	eng	I felt the same way about that as Tom did.
6664603	eng	I feel that I owe Tom an explanation.
6664604	eng	I almost never leave the house.
6664605	eng	Tom invited Mary into his office.
6664606	eng	Tom is in the ER.
6664607	eng	I almost never do that at home.
6664608	eng	Tom could help change that.
6664609	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't waste his time trying to convince Mary to do that.
6664610	eng	I almost never do anything new.
6664611	eng	I don't think Tom knows why I'm planning to do that.
6664612	eng	Tom helped Mary when she needed help.
6664613	eng	I almost died in that accident.
6664614	eng	I don't want my children to play with Tom.
6664615	eng	I got an email from Tom this morning.
6664616	eng	I admit that I've been naughty.
6664617	eng	Tom is a fun person to be around.
6664618	eng	Tom got very hot.
6664619	eng	You'd better be ready by 2:30.
6664620	eng	Tom certainly was friendly.
6664621	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't waste his time trying to persuade Mary to do that.
6664622	eng	You don't look very confident.
6664623	eng	I don't want to play any of the songs Tom requested.
6664624	eng	Tom heard somebody shouting for help.
6664625	eng	You don't look nervous at all.
6664626	eng	I don't understand why Tom acted that way.
6664627	eng	I got here three hours after Tom did.
6664628	eng	You don't look like a teacher.
6664629	eng	Tom is always talking about Mary.
6664630	eng	Tom got very fat.
6664631	eng	You don't have to wait for me.
6664632	eng	Tom bought a pair of socks.
6664633	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as amused by what was going on as Mary seemed to be.
6664634	eng	Why don't you have your hat on?
6664635	eng	I got a book down from the shelf and gave it to Tom.
6664636	eng	Tom has no idea how I feel about him.
6664637	eng	Why do women hate you so much?
6664638	eng	I don't think Tom was hesitant to do that.
6664639	eng	I got mad at Tom because he was late.
6664640	eng	When did you learn to do that?
6664641	eng	Tom is ambitious, but Mary isn't.
6664642	eng	Tom fell in love.
6664643	eng	What did you have for dessert?
6664644	eng	Tom bought a pair of pants.
6664645	eng	Tom has written a lot of books, but none of them have ever been published.
6664646	eng	What am I supposed to do next?
6664647	eng	I happened to be in Boston at the same time Tom was.
6664648	eng	Tom has known Mary since third grade.
6664649	eng	We're not waiting for the bus.
6664650	eng	I don't think Tom did what he said he did.
6664651	eng	I have a close relationship with Tom.
6664652	eng	We need to clean up this mess.
6664653	eng	Tom is assertive, but Mary isn't.
6664654	eng	Maybe Tom forgot.
6664655	eng	We can manage this on our own.
6664656	eng	Tom bought a pair of jeans.
6664657	eng	Tom is carrying an umbrella because it was raining when he left his house.
6664658	eng	We all have to obey the rules.
6664659	eng	I have no idea why Tom wanted me to stop doing that.
6664660	eng	Tom has experience, but Mary doesn't.
6664661	eng	The floor has just been waxed.
6664662	eng	I don't think I'll be doing that with Tom.
6664663	eng	I have a picture of Tom in my wallet.
6664664	eng	Thanks for helping me do this.
6664665	eng	Tom is available, but Mary isn't.
6664666	eng	I'll make Tom go.
6664667	eng	Now is a good time to do that.
6664668	eng	Tom became very suspicious.
6664669	eng	Tom was still in his pajamas when I went to his house yesterday afternoon.
6664670	eng	Nothing bad's going to happen.
6664671	eng	I plan to stay until Monday no matter what Tom says.
6664672	eng	Tom has been working for three hours.
6664673	eng	Luckily, I had a backup plan.
6664674	eng	I don't speak French and neither does Tom.
6664675	eng	I have a son not much older than Tom.
6664676	eng	Let's go on a picnic together.
6664677	eng	Tom is back home with his family.
6664678	eng	I often call Tom.
6664679	eng	Let's get the meeting started.
6664680	eng	Tom became very frustrated.
6664681	eng	I was surprised when I found out that Tom used to be a professional golfer.
6664682	eng	It wasn't snowing when I left.
6664683	eng	I should've advised Tom to not talk to Mary anymore.
6664684	eng	Tom has been doing that all day long.
6664685	eng	It wasn't raining when I left.
6664686	eng	I don't remember Tom's girlfriend's name.
6664687	eng	I have no idea what Tom's parents do.
6664688	eng	It was nice of you to do that.
6664689	eng	Tom is competent, but Mary isn't.
6664690	eng	Go tell Tom that.
6664691	eng	I'm too tired to help you now.
6664692	eng	Tom became very frightened.
6664693	eng	Tom asked me to do him a favor. However, I wasn't able to do what he asked.
6664694	eng	I'm too busy to do that today.
6664695	eng	I thought Tom would be more enthusiastic about that.
6664696	eng	Tom has a doctor's appointment today.
6664697	eng	I'm the one who mows the lawn.
6664698	eng	I don't remember Tom asking us to do that.
6664699	eng	I have no idea when Tom will do that.
6664700	eng	I'm the one who mows our lawn.
6664701	eng	Tom is conceited, but Mary isn't.
6664702	eng	I'm the one who milks the cow.
6664703	eng	Tom became very distracted.
6664704	eng	Tom got a little concerned when Mary didn't arrive when she said she would.
6664705	eng	I'm the one who got beaten up.
6664706	eng	I told Tom he should save a little money each month.
6664707	eng	Tom found the necklace Mary had lost.
6664708	eng	I'm the one who feeds the dog.
6664709	eng	I don't really want to go skiing with Tom.
6664710	eng	I haven't talked with Tom about that.
6664711	eng	I'm the one who feeds our dog.
6664712	eng	Tom is confident, but Mary isn't.
6664713	eng	Does Tom love me?
6664714	eng	I'm the one who cooked dinner.
6664715	eng	Tom ate dinner in the dark.
6664716	eng	Tom has written a lot of books, but only three of them have been published.
6664717	eng	I'm not sure if I can do that.
6664718	eng	I'd like to know how long Tom plans to be in Boston.
6664719	eng	Tom finished his shift and went home.
6664720	eng	I'm going to fly to Australia.
6664721	eng	I don't know why Tom wanted Mary to leave.
6664722	eng	I left without saying goodbye to Tom.
6664723	eng	I'm going to do that sometime.
6664724	eng	Tom is courteous, but Mary isn't.
6664725	eng	Does Tom hate me?
6664726	eng	I'm going to do that for sure.
6664727	eng	Tom asked Mary to hurry up.
6664728	eng	Tom was sitting by himself at a table in the corner and was reading a book.
6664729	eng	I'm going to camp this summer.
6664730	eng	I'll never forget the first time Tom and I did that.
6664731	eng	Tom doesn't think it's going to work.
6664732	eng	I'm going to become a teacher.
6664733	eng	I don't know where Tom goes every evening.
6664734	eng	I talked with Tom about that already.
6664735	eng	I'm going to be here tomorrow.
6664736	eng	Tom is dedicated, but Mary isn't.
6664737	eng	Call Tom tonight.
6664738	eng	I'm going to be here all year.
6664739	eng	Tom and I aren't that poor.
6664740	eng	I got out in front of the theater and waited while Tom went to park the car.
6664741	eng	I'm going to be here all week.
6664742	eng	I'm good at getting Tom to do what I want him to do.
6664743	eng	Tom doesn't ride his bicycle anymore.
6664744	eng	I'm going to be free tomorrow.
6664745	eng	I don't know the reason why Tom is absent.
6664746	eng	I thought Tom would be able to drive.
6664747	eng	I'm going to be busy tomorrow.
6664748	eng	Tom is depressed, but Mary isn't.
6664749	eng	Call Tom at 2:30.
6664750	eng	I'm going to be a father soon.
6664751	eng	Tom and I aren't like that.
6664752	eng	I had a lot on my mind, so I wasn't really listening to what Tom was saying.
6664753	eng	I'm fairly sure I can do that.
6664754	eng	I'm overweight, but I'm not as overweight as Tom is.
6664755	eng	Tom doesn't know how to ride a horse.
6664756	eng	I'm fairly good at doing that.
6664757	eng	I don't know the boy who's talking to Tom.
6664758	eng	I told Tom I felt like taking a walk.
6664759	eng	I'm able to do that on my own.
6664760	eng	Tom is dishonest, but Mary isn't.
6664761	eng	Tom scared Mary.
6664762	eng	I'm able to do that by myself.
6664763	eng	Tom and I are kind of busy.
6664764	eng	Tom became a little worried when Mary didn't arrive when she said she would.
6664765	eng	I'll start doing that tonight.
6664766	eng	I'm the one who helped Tom pull weeds in the garden.
6664767	eng	Tom doesn't know how much I love him.
6664768	eng	I'll never fall in love again.
6664769	eng	I don't have a dog and Tom doesn't either.
6664770	eng	I told Tom he should be more careful.
6664771	eng	I'll live in Boston next year.
6664772	eng	Tom is exhausted, but Mary isn't.
6664773	eng	Tom got violent.
6664774	eng	I'll go to Boston and Chicago.
6664775	eng	Tom and I are here to stay.
6664776	eng	I don't know exactly what time Tom got home last night, but it was very late.
6664777	eng	I'll do that for you for free.
6664778	eng	I'm the one who taught Tom how to play the dulcimer.
6664779	eng	Tom does everything Mary asks him to.
6664780	eng	I'll do that after I get back.
6664781	eng	I don't have a car and Tom doesn't either.
6664782	eng	I told Tom he should drink more milk.
6664783	eng	I'll be working all afternoon.
6664784	eng	Tom is forgetful, but Mary isn't.
6664785	eng	Tom got smashed.
6664786	eng	I'll be very sad if you leave.
6664787	eng	Tom always talks about you.
6664788	eng	I don't think Tom will be as enthusiastic about doing that as you seem to be.
6664789	eng	I'll be tired when I get home.
6664790	eng	It would be better if Tom didn't do that by himself.
6664791	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to get involved.
6664792	eng	I'll be there in half an hour.
6664793	eng	I don't ever go swimming with Tom anymore.
6664794	eng	I told Tom he should see the dentist.
6664795	eng	I'll be here till next Monday.
6664796	eng	Tom is going back to Boston soon.
6664797	eng	Tom got retired.
6664798	eng	I'll be here for several days.
6664799	eng	Tom Jackson is our manager.
6664800	eng	Tom needs another lawyer. The one he has doesn't seem to know what he's doing.
6664801	eng	I'll be happy if that happens.
6664802	eng	The town where Tom and I were born isn't very large.
6664803	eng	Tom didn't seem to even recognize me.
6664804	eng	I'll be arriving an hour late.
6664805	eng	I didn't think Tom would get here on time.
6664806	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't buy that car.
6664807	eng	I won't be at today's meeting.
6664808	eng	Tom is going to make some coffee.
6664809	eng	Tom got curious.
6664810	eng	I won't be able to do that alone.
6664811	eng	Those aren't Tom's parents.
6664812	eng	Tom picked some flowers from the garden and put them on the dining room table.
6664813	eng	I was arrested for doing that.
6664814	eng	There's no way Tom and I are going to do that today.
6664815	eng	Tom didn't get anything he asked for.
6664816	eng	I want this as much as you do.
6664817	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so unfriendly.
6664818	eng	I tried to do what Tom told me to do.
6664819	eng	I want that as much as you do.
6664820	eng	Tom is hotheaded, but Mary isn't.
6664821	eng	Tom got alarmed.
6664822	eng	I think I'm going to be fired.
6664823	eng	This used to be Tom's home.
6664824	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as glad that that's going to happen as Mary seems to be.
6664825	eng	I still don't have to do that.
6664826	eng	This is the hospital where both Tom and I were born.
6664827	eng	Tom didn't do what he promised to do.
6664828	eng	I spent all day planting corn.
6664829	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so suspicious.
6664830	eng	I washed and waxed Tom's car for him.
6664831	eng	I should be there before 2:30.
6664832	eng	Tom is impartial, but Mary isn't.
6664833	eng	I should be getting home soon.
6664834	eng	That's what made Tom happy.
6664835	eng	Tom slept on the porch last night because he'd locked himself out of his house.
6664836	eng	I remember reading about that.
6664837	eng	Tom almost forgot to put his passport in his pocket.
6664838	eng	Tom did everything Mary asked him to.
6664839	eng	I often play tennis on Monday.
6664840	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so supportive.
6664841	eng	I wish I knew why Tom didn't do that.
6664842	eng	I often go downtown on Monday.
6664843	eng	Tom is impatient, but Mary isn't.
6664844	eng	How's Tom today?
6664845	eng	I often come here on weekends.
6664846	eng	That's what made Tom angry.
6664847	eng	Tom tried to think of something nice to say, but he couldn't think of anything.
6664848	eng	I might get hurt if I do that.
6664849	eng	Tom already knows what Mary is planning to tell him.
6664850	eng	Tom dated Mary before he dated Alice.
6664851	eng	I know you don't like me much.
6664852	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so successful.
6664853	eng	I wish I lived in a house like Tom's.
6664854	eng	I hope you don't get homesick.
6664855	eng	Tom is impulsive, but Mary isn't.
6664856	eng	Hats off to Tom.
6664857	eng	I have plans for Monday night.
6664858	eng	Please don't call Tom back.
6664859	eng	I don't know anything about Tom, other than the fact that he's Mary's boyfriend.
6664860	eng	I have many friends in Boston.
6664861	eng	Tom and I are the only ones who know how to do that.
6664862	eng	Tom couldn't lift the box by himself.
6664863	eng	I have burns all over my body.
6664864	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so reasonable.
6664865	eng	I wonder if Tom ever works on Monday.
6664866	eng	I have an important job to do.
6664867	eng	Tom is in Boston, but Mary isn't.
6664868	eng	Don't touch Tom.
6664869	eng	I have a store on Park Street.
6664870	eng	No wonder Tom was confused.
6664871	eng	I got tired of waiting for Tom, so I went into the restaurant and ate by myself.
6664872	eng	I have a meeting this morning.
6664873	eng	Tom and I are the only ones who know how to do this.
6664874	eng	Tom called Mary just before midnight.
6664875	eng	I have a lot of history books.
6664876	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so prejudiced.
6664877	eng	I wouldn't want to be Tom's roommate.
6664878	eng	I have a lot of acquaintances.
6664879	eng	Tom is kind of strange, isn't he?
6664880	eng	Bring Tom to me.
6664881	eng	I have a list of things to do.
6664882	eng	My car is newer than Tom's.
6664883	eng	Tom has written a lot of books, but only three of them have ever been published.
6664884	eng	I have a degree in psychology.
6664885	eng	Tom and I stayed up all night talking to each other.
6664886	eng	Tom became very sick and almost died.
6664887	eng	I have a black belt in karate.
6664888	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so persuasive.
6664889	eng	I'll be staying with Tom for a while.
6664890	eng	I had my blood pressure taken.
6664891	eng	Tom is my second son's third son.
6664892	eng	Are those Tom's?
6664893	eng	I had good reason to be upset.
6664894	eng	Maybe Tom has already left.
6664895	eng	Tom missed his wife and children, so he's gone back to Boston to live with them.
6664896	eng	I had good reason to be angry.
6664897	eng	Tom and I weren't the only ones who failed the test.
6664898	eng	Tom asked why Mary needed to do that.
6664899	eng	I had breakfast all by myself.
6664900	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so particular.
6664901	eng	I'll try to stop Tom from doing that.
6664902	eng	I had back surgery in October.
6664903	eng	Tom is objective, but Mary isn't.
6664904	eng	Tom owns a dog.
6664905	eng	I had a bad day at the office.
6664906	eng	Maybe Tom and I were wrong.
6664907	eng	Tom's doctor told him not to eat so much sugar.
6664908	eng	I got to the hotel after dark.
6664909	eng	Tom and I weren't the only ones who knew about that.
6664910	eng	Tom asked me to wake Mary up at 2:30.
6664911	eng	I got some shampoo in my eyes.
6664912	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so overweight.
6664913	eng	I'm the one who gave Tom his bicycle.
6664914	eng	I got sick and had to go home.
6664915	eng	Tom is observant, but Mary isn't.
6664916	eng	Tom loves jazz.
6664917	eng	I got punished for doing that.
6664918	eng	Luckily, Tom wasn't killed.
6664919	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to say anything to John about seeing Alice with another man.
6664920	eng	I got married three weeks ago.
6664921	eng	Tom and Mary sat in front of the fireplace, talking.
6664922	eng	Tom asked me to teach him how to ski.
6664923	eng	I got here thirty minutes ago.
6664924	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so optimistic.
6664925	eng	I'm the one who taught Tom that song.
6664926	eng	I got here early this morning.
6664927	eng	Tom is obstinate, but Mary isn't.
6664928	eng	Tom is all wet.
6664929	eng	I got back in my car and left.
6664930	eng	Let's go swimming with Tom.
6664931	eng	What really surprised me most was that Tom and I were the only ones who got fired.
6664932	eng	I got arrested for doing that.
6664933	eng	Tom asked Mary to teach him how to play the ukulele.
6664934	eng	Tom asked me to take Mary to the zoo.
6664935	eng	I got almost everything wrong.
6664936	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so interested.
6664937	eng	I've agreed to meet Tom after school.
6664938	eng	I got a bicycle for Christmas.
6664939	eng	Tom is only interested in sports.
6664940	eng	Tom got famous.
6664941	eng	I get my secretary to do that.
6664942	eng	It wasn't easy to find Tom.
6664943	eng	Thanks to your help, Tom and I were able to get that done faster than we'd planned.
6664944	eng	I felt I had to say something.
6664945	eng	Tom asked if there was anything he could do to help.
6664946	eng	Tom asked me to lend Mary some money.
6664947	eng	I drank another glass of wine.
6664948	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so displeased.
6664949	eng	If Tom is tired, he should go to bed.
6664950	eng	I don't yet know why I'm here.
6664951	eng	Tom is organized, but Mary isn't.
6664952	eng	Tom felt brave.
6664953	eng	I don't want to work tomorrow.
6664954	eng	It looks like Tom is happy.
6664955	eng	Tom and Mary lived in a mobile home their first three years after they got married.
6664956	eng	I don't want to join the team.
6664957	eng	Tom asked me to go to Boston with Mary next weekend.
6664958	eng	Tom asked me if I'd mind helping him.
6664959	eng	I don't want to go to Harvard.
6664960	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so dependable.
6664961	eng	It sounds like Tom will go to Boston.
6664962	eng	I don't want to go for a walk.
6664963	eng	Tom is planning to buy that book.
6664964	eng	I'm sorry, Tom.
6664965	eng	I don't usually drink so much.
6664966	eng	I'm the one who helped Tom.
6664967	eng	Tom asked me to do him a favor. However, I wasn't able to do what he asked me to do.
6664968	eng	I don't usually do that alone.
6664969	eng	Tom didn't have a job the last time I talked to him.
6664970	eng	Tom asked Mary if she could help him.
6664971	eng	I don't think that we can win.
6664972	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so courageous.
6664973	eng	It's a wonder that Tom wasn't killed.
6664974	eng	I don't think that I did that.
6664975	eng	Tom is planning to do that today.
6664976	eng	I can beat Tom.
6664977	eng	I don't think it's impossible.
6664978	eng	I'm not as broke as Tom is.
6664979	eng	Tom is always complaining that he doesn't have enough time to do what he wants to do.
6664980	eng	I don't think I have a choice.
6664981	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as angry as Mary seemed to be.
6664982	eng	Tom arrived unexpectedly from Boston.
6664983	eng	I don't take a bath every day.
6664984	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so aggressive.
6664985	eng	It's clear that Tom isn't happy here.
6664986	eng	I don't quite see it that way.
6664987	eng	Tom is reputable, but Mary isn't.
6664988	eng	Give Tom a hug.
6664989	eng	I don't quite know what to do.
6664990	eng	I'm not as angry as Tom is.
6664991	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought it would be dangerous to walk in the park alone at night.
6664992	eng	I don't plan on stepping down.
6664993	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as bored as Mary seemed to be.
6664994	eng	Tom and Mary seemed to be having fun.
6664995	eng	I don't often do that at home.
6664996	eng	I didn't really understand what Tom meant.
6664997	epo	Tomo ne surhavas ĉapelon.
6664998	eng	Let's ask Tom if he'd do that for us.
6664999	eng	I don't need to do that, do I?
6665000	eng	Tom is skeptical, but Mary isn't.
6665001	eng	Dance with Tom.
6665002	eng	I don't mind getting up early.
6665003	eng	I'll tell Tom all about it.
6665004	eng	Tom and his wife adopted a girl whose parents had been killed in an automobile accident.
6665005	eng	I don't listen to rap anymore.
6665006	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as brave as Mary seemed to be.
6665007	eng	Tom and Mary got married last summer.
6665008	eng	I don't like the way you sing.
6665009	eng	I didn't know Tom could understand French.
6665010	eng	Let's let Tom finish what he's doing.
6665011	eng	I don't like the way you cook.
6665012	eng	Tom is staying with me this week.
6665013	eng	Can Tom see me?
6665014	eng	I don't like the rainy season.
6665015	eng	I'll sit wait here for Tom.
6665016	eng	Tom is learning French because he eventually wants to live in a French-speaking country.
6665017	eng	I don't like tennis very much.
6665018	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as crazy as Mary seemed to be.
6665019	eng	Tom and Mary eventually got divorced.
6665020	eng	I don't like my mother-in-law.
6665021	eng	I can't very well turn my back on Tom now.
6665022	eng	None of Tom's friends would help him.
6665023	eng	I don't like apples very much.
6665024	eng	Tom is still doing that, I think.
6665025	eng	Tom messed up.
6665026	eng	I washed Tom's car for him.
6665027	eng	I can't figure out how Tom was able to plan a surprise party without me knowing about it.
6665028	eng	I don't know where I was born.
6665029	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as drunk as Mary seemed to be.
6665030	eng	Tom and I are the ones who need help.
6665031	eng	I don't know much about sheep.
6665032	eng	I almost never help Tom with his homework.
6665033	eng	That's not what Tom and I were doing.
6665034	eng	I don't know Boston very well.
6665035	eng	Tom is supposed to be helping us.
6665036	eng	Tom got quiet.
6665037	eng	I don't have to work tomorrow.
6665038	eng	I usually do that with Tom.
6665039	eng	I pressed my ear to the door to see if I could hear what Tom and Mary were talking about.
6665040	eng	I don't have to do that, do I?
6665041	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as fussy as Mary seemed to be.
6665042	eng	Tom and I are going to buy a new car.
6665043	eng	I don't have much of a choice.
6665044	eng	I almost kissed Tom, but I decided not to.
6665045	eng	That's the reason Tom and I are here.
6665046	eng	I don't have expensive tastes.
6665047	eng	Tom is talkative, but Mary isn't.
6665048	eng	Tom came late.
6665049	eng	I don't have any real friends.
6665050	eng	I told Tom to take the job.
6665051	eng	Tom is a vegetarian, so he didn't eat the beef stew that Mary spent all afternoon cooking.
6665052	eng	I don't have any friends here.
6665053	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as lucky as Mary seemed to be.
6665054	eng	Tom always pays attention to details.
6665055	eng	I don't have a microwave oven.
6665056	eng	I advised Tom to not talk to Mary anymore.
6665057	eng	The person Tom is talking to is Mary.
6665058	eng	I don't have a lot of friends.
6665059	eng	Tom is terrified, but Mary isn't.
6665060	eng	Is Tom in bed?
6665061	eng	I don't go fishing very often.
6665062	eng	I told Tom to take a break.
6665063	eng	I think the reason Tom didn't recognize me was because I had a beard the last time he saw me.
6665064	eng	I don't enjoy giving speeches.
6665065	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as naive as Mary seemed to be.
6665066	eng	Tom always helps me when I need help.
6665067	eng	I didn't get the job I wanted.
6665068	eng	I admit I did what Tom asked me not to do.
6665069	eng	These clothes are all Tom's and mine.
6665070	eng	I can't very well do that now.
6665071	eng	Tom is the right guy for the job.
6665072	eng	I do love Tom.
6665073	eng	I can't take on any more work.
6665074	eng	I told Tom to study French.
6665075	eng	Tom is staying at his uncle's, because his parents have gone to Boston for a couple of weeks.
6665076	eng	I can't see myself doing that.
6665077	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as ready as Mary seemed to be.
6665078	eng	Tom always has to have the last word.
6665079	eng	I can't go to Boston with you.
6665080	eng	How much of this stuff is Tom's and yours?
6665081	eng	This computer isn't Tom's. It's mine.
6665082	eng	I can't go out with you today.
6665083	eng	Tom is uninsured, but Mary isn't.
6665084	eng	Give Tom time.
6665085	eng	I can't finish this job today.
6665086	eng	I told Tom to stay at home.
6665087	eng	If Tom had been wearing a bullet-proof vest like the other police officers, he probably wouldn't have died.
6665088	eng	I can't do that all by myself.
6665089	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as sharp as Mary seemed to be.
6665090	eng	Tom advised Mary to accept the offer.
6665091	eng	I can't come to work tomorrow.
6665092	eng	How disappointed do you think Tom will be?
6665093	eng	Tom adapted to the new circumstances.
6665094	eng	I can't afford all this stuff.
6665095	eng	Tom is unmarried, but Mary isn't.
6665096	eng	Does Tom work?
6665097	eng	I ate breakfast all by myself.
6665098	eng	I told Tom to learn karate.
6665099	eng	If Tom had been wearing a bullet-proof vest like the other police officers, he probably wouldn't have been killed.
6665100	eng	I almost never work on Monday.
6665101	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as tense as Mary seemed to be.
6665102	eng	Tom got rich.
6665103	eng	I almost never make a mistake.
6665104	eng	Here's a picture of Tom wearing a red tie.
6665105	eng	Goodbye, Tom.
6665106	eng	I almost hit a telephone pole.
6665107	eng	Tom is willing to pay up to $300.
6665108	eng	Go after Tom.
6665109	eng	I almost drowned in the river.
6665110	eng	I told Tom to buy that car.
6665111	eng	I almost always win arguments.
6665112	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as tired as Mary seemed to be.
6665113	eng	Tom belched.
6665114	eng	I almost always do that alone.
6665115	eng	Do you think Tom was telling us the truth?
6665116	eng	Bye, Tom.
6665117	eng	I admitted I'd made a mistake.
6665118	eng	Tom is with his dogs in the park.
6665119	eng	Every muscle in my body aches.
6665120	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't go.
6665121	eng	You'll be sorry you did that.
6665122	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as upset as Mary seemed to be.
6665123	eng	You'll be happy you did that.
6665124	eng	You think Tom is good-looking, don't you?
6665125	eng	You'd better watch your back.
6665126	eng	Tom isn't as careless as Mary is.
6665127	eng	You need to be ready by 2:30.
6665128	eng	I tied Tom's shoes for him.
6665129	eng	You look like you're unhappy.
6665130	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as weird as Mary seemed to be.
6665131	eng	You have very good instincts.
6665132	eng	You should really ask Tom what he thinks.
6665133	eng	You don't seem too concerned.
6665134	eng	Tom isn't as competitive as I am.
6665135	eng	You don't seem to be nervous.
6665136	eng	I think Tom is just sleepy.
6665137	eng	You don't look too convinced.
6665138	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as young as Mary seemed to be.
6665139	eng	You don't help me very often.
6665140	eng	You don't seem to be as motivated as Tom.
6665141	eng	You didn't eat that, did you?
6665142	eng	Tom isn't as hardworking as I am.
6665143	eng	Will you go to Boston by bus?
6665144	eng	I talked to Tom about that.
6665145	eng	Where did you go last Monday?
6665146	eng	Tom doesn't practice the piano as much as Mary does.
6665147	eng	What did you eat for dessert?
6665148	eng	You don't seem to be as ambitious as Tom.
6665149	eng	We moved to Boston last fall.
6665150	eng	Tom isn't as pessimistic as I am.
6665151	eng	This didn't cost me anything.
6665152	eng	I parked Tom's car for him.
6665153	eng	Tell me what I'm doing wrong.
6665154	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as angry as Mary seems to be.
6665155	eng	Tell me if I get in your way.
6665156	eng	Which pairs of shoes are Tom's and yours?
6665157	eng	Tell me exactly what you did.
6665158	eng	Tom isn't as sociable as Mary is.
6665159	eng	Take all this to the kitchen.
6665160	eng	I mowed Tom's lawn for him.
6665161	eng	Now is a bad time to do that.
6665162	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as bored as Mary seems to be.
6665163	eng	Mary is the cutest girl here.
6665164	eng	We're all convinced that Tom is innocent.
6665165	eng	Let's get something to drink.
6665166	eng	Tom isn't conceited, but Mary is.
6665167	eng	It took about thirty minutes.
6665168	eng	I left Tom's house at 2:30.
6665169	eng	Is this store open on Monday?
6665170	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as brave as Mary seems to be.
6665171	eng	If you need my help, call me.
6665172	eng	We can't hide the truth from Tom anymore.
6665173	eng	I've been tempted to do that.
6665174	eng	Tom isn't confident, but Mary is.
6665175	eng	I'm the one who planned this.
6665176	eng	I hope Tom tells the truth.
6665177	eng	I'm the one who did all this.
6665178	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as crazy as Mary seems to be.
6665179	eng	I'm going to quit doing that.
6665180	eng	Tom's parents died when Tom was thirteen.
6665181	eng	I'm going to miss doing this.
6665182	eng	Tom isn't dangerous, but Mary is.
6665183	eng	I'm going to miss doing that.
6665184	eng	I heard Tom in the kitchen.
6665185	eng	I'm going to let you do that.
6665186	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as drunk as Mary seems to be.
6665187	eng	I'm going to get better soon.
6665188	eng	Tom's mother told him to wash the dishes.
6665189	eng	I'm going to be leaving soon.
6665190	eng	Tom isn't depressed, but Mary is.
6665191	eng	I'm going to be home tonight.
6665192	eng	I have a huge crush on Tom.
6665193	eng	I'm going to be home by 2:30.
6665194	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as fussy as Mary seems to be.
6665195	eng	I'm going to be here tonight.
6665196	eng	Tom's mother told him to do his homework.
6665197	eng	I'm going to be here all day.
6665198	eng	Tom isn't desperate, but Mary is.
6665199	eng	I'm going to be gone all day.
6665200	eng	I have a brother named Tom.
6665201	eng	I'm going to be an architect.
6665202	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as lucky as Mary seems to be.
6665203	eng	I'm expecting that to happen.
6665204	eng	Tom's hands are clean, but Mary's aren't.
6665205	eng	I'm expected to do that, too.
6665206	eng	Tom isn't exhausted, but Mary is.
6665207	eng	I'm beginning to feel hungry.
6665208	eng	I had fun talking with Tom.
6665209	eng	I'm also expected to do that.
6665210	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as naive as Mary seems to be.
6665211	eng	I'm afraid to try doing that.
6665212	eng	Tom's family visited him in the hospital.
6665213	eng	I'll play the guitar for you.
6665214	eng	Tom isn't impatient, but Mary is.
6665215	eng	I'll pick you up around 2:30.
6665216	eng	I had fun dancing with Tom.
6665217	eng	I'll eat this if you do, too.
6665218	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as needy as Mary seems to be.
6665219	eng	I'll be there this afternoon.
6665220	eng	Tom wrote Mary's address on the envelope.
6665221	eng	I'll be there in three hours.
6665222	eng	Tom isn't impulsive, but Mary is.
6665223	eng	I'll be there for a few days.
6665224	eng	I had a big fight with Tom.
6665225	eng	I'll be the person in charge.
6665226	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as ready as Mary seems to be.
6665227	eng	I'll be really busy, won't I?
6665228	eng	Tom wouldn't do anything we asked him to.
6665229	eng	I'll be here only a few days.
6665230	eng	Tom isn't in Boston, but Mary is.
6665231	eng	I'll be here for three weeks.
6665232	eng	I got there before Tom did.
6665233	eng	I'll be getting married soon.
6665234	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as sharp as Mary seems to be.
6665235	eng	I'd be too scared to do that.
6665236	eng	Tom would never forgive me if I did that.
6665237	eng	I won't be there before 2:30.
6665238	eng	Tom isn't obnoxious, but Mary is.
6665239	eng	I wish I had a car like this.
6665240	eng	I got in the boat with Tom.
6665241	eng	I want to buy a new trombone.
6665242	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as smart as Mary seems to be.
6665243	eng	I usually do that on Mondays.
6665244	eng	Tom will go to Boston tomorrow, won't he?
6665245	eng	I think we should start over.
6665246	eng	Tom isn't organized, but Mary is.
6665247	eng	I think I now know the truth.
6665248	eng	I got Tom to drive me home.
6665249	eng	I stayed at home last Monday.
6665250	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as tense as Mary seems to be.
6665251	eng	I shaved my head last spring.
6665252	eng	Tom went to the park on Monday afternoon.
6665253	eng	I'm not all that busy nowadays.
6665254	eng	Tom isn't satisfied, but Mary is.
6665255	eng	I need to clean up this mess.
6665256	eng	I got Tom a glass of water.
6665257	eng	I need to buy a new computer.
6665258	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as tired as Mary seems to be.
6665259	eng	I haven't gotten my visa yet.
6665260	eng	Tom went to night school for three years.
6665261	eng	I have plans to go to Boston.
6665262	eng	Tom isn't skeptical, but Mary is.
6665263	eng	I have nothing to talk about.
6665264	eng	I don't want Tom's old job.
6665265	eng	I have a son who's in prison.
6665266	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as upset as Mary seems to be.
6665267	eng	I have a lot of French books.
6665268	eng	Tom went to get some water from the well.
6665269	eng	I have a habit of doing that.
6665270	eng	Tom isn't stupid. He's just lazy.
6665271	eng	I have a diplomatic passport.
6665272	eng	I don't think Tom was late.
6665273	eng	I have a daughter named Mary.
6665274	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as weird as Mary seems to be.
6665275	eng	I have a calendar on my desk.
6665276	eng	Tom went to Boston to study architecture.
6665277	eng	I have a Canadian girlfriend.
6665278	eng	Tom isn't talkative, but Mary is.
6665279	eng	I had good reason to do that.
6665280	eng	I don't think Tom was hurt.
6665281	eng	I had an operation last week.
6665282	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as young as Mary seems to be.
6665283	eng	I had an important job to do.
6665284	eng	Tom went swimming every Monday last year.
6665285	eng	I had a hard time doing that.
6665286	eng	Tom isn't unmarried, but Mary is.
6665287	eng	I had a good time doing that.
6665288	eng	I don't think Tom was home.
6665289	eng	I got up and started dancing.
6665290	eng	Tom entertained us by telling us some funny stories.
6665291	eng	I got to the station at 2:30.
6665292	eng	Tom went from Boston to Chicago by plane.
6665293	eng	I got to school just in time.
6665294	eng	Tom left Boston in early October.
6665295	eng	I got three weeks' detention.
6665296	eng	I don't think Tom was here.
6665297	eng	I got talked into doing that.
6665298	eng	Tom entertained us by telling us some ghost stories.
6665299	eng	I got stuck in a traffic jam.
6665300	eng	Tom wasn't satisfied with Mary's answers.
6665301	eng	I got straight A's in school.
6665302	eng	Tom likes chocolate, but I don't.
6665303	eng	I got scolded by the teacher.
6665304	eng	I don't think Tom was done.
6665305	eng	I got out of jail in October.
6665306	eng	Tom forgot the name of the person he was talking to.
6665307	eng	I got on my bicycle and left.
6665308	eng	Tom wasn't as upset as I thought he'd be.
6665309	eng	I got everything I asked for.
6665310	eng	Tom likes me and I like him, too.
6665311	eng	I get good grades in science.
6665312	eng	I don't think Tom was busy.
6665313	eng	I felt I had to do something.
6665314	eng	Tom gets home at about 2:30 every day except Monday.
6665315	eng	I don't wear a hat every day.
6665316	eng	Tom wasn't allowed to tell Mary anything.
6665317	eng	I don't want to work outside.
6665318	eng	Tom looked at me like I was nuts.
6665319	eng	I don't want to visit Boston.
6665320	eng	I don't think Tom is weird.
6665321	eng	I don't want to study abroad.
6665322	eng	Tom goes home and has lunch with his wife every day.
6665323	eng	I don't want to go to prison.
6665324	eng	Tom wasn't able to do that, but Mary was.
6665325	eng	I don't want to be suspended.
6665326	eng	Tom looks like he has a headache.
6665327	eng	I don't want to be seen here.
6665328	eng	I don't think Tom is tough.
6665329	eng	I don't usually do that here.
6665330	eng	Tom got scared as soon as he saw the robber's knife.
6665331	eng	I don't understand it myself.
6665332	eng	Tom washed the apple before he peeled it.
6665333	eng	I don't think that I can win.
6665334	eng	Tom loved Mary and she loved him.
6665335	eng	I don't regret what happened.
6665336	eng	I don't think Tom is timid.
6665337	eng	I don't plan to study French.
6665338	eng	Tom handed me a shovel and told me to start digging.
6665339	eng	I don't love my wife anymore.
6665340	eng	Tom washed the apple and began eating it.
6665341	eng	I don't like you much either.
6665342	eng	Tom might cause us some problems.
6665343	eng	I don't like lukewarm coffee.
6665344	eng	I don't think Tom is sorry.
6665345	eng	I don't like living downtown.
6665346	eng	Tom has two cats. One's white and the other's black.
6665347	eng	I don't like giving speeches.
6665348	eng	Tom was unfazed by that, but Mary wasn't.
6665349	eng	I don't have much experience.
6665350	eng	Tom moved from Boston to Chicago.
6665351	eng	I don't have a place to live.
6665352	eng	I don't think Tom is lucky.
6665353	eng	I don't go to work on Monday.
6665354	eng	Tom hasn't been to Boston as many times as Mary has.
6665355	eng	I don't go to Boston anymore.
6665356	eng	Tom was the one who suggested doing that.
6665357	eng	I don't even want it anymore.
6665358	eng	Tom needs to change his behavior.
6665359	eng	I don't come here that often.
6665360	eng	I don't think Tom is bossy.
6665361	eng	I can't understand this poem.
6665362	eng	Tom is a guy who's not afraid to tell it like it is.
6665363	eng	I can't tie my own shoes yet.
6665364	eng	Tom was the last one to leave the office.
6665365	eng	I can't teach French anymore.
6665366	eng	Tom noticed a spot on John's tie.
6665367	eng	I can't take credit for that.
6665368	eng	I don't think Tom is alive.
6665369	eng	I can't speak French, either.
6665370	eng	Tom is always complaining about something, isn't he?
6665371	eng	I can't play piano very well.
6665372	eng	Tom was surprised that Mary quit her job.
6665373	eng	I can't go to Boston, either.
6665374	eng	Tom promised you that, didn't he?
6665375	eng	I can't give this to you yet.
6665376	eng	I don't see Tom very often.
6665377	eng	I can't give this to you now.
6665378	eng	Tom is convinced that Mary won't ever do that again.
6665379	eng	I can't get this window open.
6665380	eng	Tom was the only one who knew how to do that.
6665381	eng	I can't get this bottle open.
6665382	eng	Tom remained in his room all day.
6665383	eng	I can't do the job by myself.
6665384	eng	I don't see Tom that often.
6665385	eng	I almost never walk anywhere.
6665386	eng	Tom is interested in knowing what's going to happen.
6665387	eng	I almost never smile anymore.
6665388	eng	Tom was living in Australia at that time.
6665389	eng	I almost never laugh anymore.
6665390	eng	Tom said he didn't feel anything.
6665391	eng	I almost never ask questions.
6665392	eng	I don't care, but Tom does.
6665393	eng	I almost got hit by the ball.
6665394	eng	Tom is just not the kind of person I thought he was.
6665395	eng	I almost drowned last summer.
6665396	eng	Tom walked to the other side of the room.
6665397	eng	I agreed to be there by 2:30.
6665398	eng	Tom said he felt a little guilty.
6665399	eng	Don't do that while I'm here.
6665400	eng	I can't help Tom right now.
6665401	eng	Do me a favor and just leave.
6665402	eng	Tom is my neighbor, but I don't know him very well.
6665403	eng	Can we go hiking next Monday?
6665404	eng	Tom usually eats lunch at twelve o'clock.
6665405	eng	Can I get you some breakfast?
6665406	eng	Tom said he felt a little stupid.
6665407	eng	You'll be safe here with us.
6665408	eng	I can't get Tom to kiss me.
6665409	eng	You'll be safe here with me.
6665410	eng	Tom is planning to stay in Boston for several weeks.
6665411	eng	You'll be glad you did that.
6665412	eng	Tom told me what he'd like for Christmas.
6665413	eng	You sound like an old woman.
6665414	eng	Tom said he felt like an outcast.
6665415	eng	You don't seem very excited.
6665416	eng	Have Tom and I missed much?
6665417	eng	You don't seem to be hungry.
6665418	eng	Tom is too young to understand what's happening.
6665419	eng	You don't seem to be afraid.
6665420	eng	Tom told me what he wanted for Christmas.
6665421	eng	You don't seem much happier.
6665422	eng	Tom said he felt very humiliated.
6665423	eng	You don't look very relaxed.
6665424	eng	Have Tom and I done enough?
6665425	eng	You don't look very healthy.
6665426	eng	Tom is very proud of what he's been able to achieve.
6665427	eng	You don't have to leave yet.
6665428	eng	Tom told me to keep what happened secret.
6665429	eng	You can't have a cookie now.
6665430	eng	Tom said he wanted us to do that.
6665431	eng	You can have another cookie.
6665432	eng	Does Tom speak French, too?
6665433	eng	Why are you holding a knife?
6665434	eng	Tom isn't as difficult to get along with as Mary is.
6665435	eng	What time will you get home?
6665436	eng	Tom told me that Mary would be skeptical.
6665437	eng	What time will you get here?
6665438	eng	Tom said he was a little nervous.
6665439	eng	What else will you be doing?
6665440	eng	Does Tom have enough money?
6665441	eng	We need a permit to do that.
6665442	eng	Tom left for Boston as soon as he got Mary's letter.
6665443	eng	We have a mess to deal with.
6665444	eng	Tom spent New Year's Eve with his family.
6665445	eng	We got lost on our way here.
6665446	eng	Tom said he was looking for Mary.
6665447	eng	That movie wasn't very good.
6665448	eng	Does Tom have any children?
6665449	eng	Tell me what you plan to do.
6665450	eng	Tom never really got into trouble when he was a kid.
6665451	eng	Let's stay here for a while.
6665452	eng	Tom spends too much time on his computer.
6665453	eng	Is that blood on your shoes?
6665454	eng	Tom said he was much happier now.
6665455	eng	I, too, have been to Boston.
6665456	eng	Can Tom get tickets for us?
6665457	eng	I'm too busy to do that now.
6665458	eng	Tom plays poker with his friends every Monday night.
6665459	eng	I'm really happy to see you.
6665460	eng	Tom spends a lot of time on his computer.
6665461	eng	I'm not old enough to drink.
6665462	eng	Tom said that he's forgiven Mary.
6665463	eng	I'm irritated by that noise.
6665464	eng	Are those Tom's sunglasses?
6665465	eng	I'm going to try to do that.
6665466	eng	Tom said I don't have to do that if I don't want to.
6665467	eng	I'm going to try doing that.
6665468	eng	Tom sometimes visits his father's office.
6665469	eng	I'm going to drive you home.
6665470	eng	Tom said that was no coincidence.
6665471	eng	I'm going to come home soon.
6665472	eng	Are these sunglasses Tom's?
6665473	eng	I'm going to come back soon.
6665474	eng	Tom said Mary didn't look very much like her mother.
6665475	eng	I'm going to buy a used car.
6665476	eng	Tom sneezes every time he's near flowers.
6665477	eng	I'm going to be there today.
6665478	eng	Tom saw a rabbit in his backyard.
6665479	eng	I'm going to be an engineer.
6665480	eng	All Tom wants is the truth.
6665481	eng	I'm going to always be here.
6665482	eng	Tom said he'd be willing to help us paint the fence.
6665483	eng	I'm getting better at chess.
6665484	eng	Tom sells vegetables at a roadside stand.
6665485	eng	I'm being forced to do that.
6665486	eng	Tom says he can't go any further.
6665487	eng	I'm beginning to feel tired.
6665488	eng	We barely see Tom anymore.
6665489	eng	I'm an expert at doing that.
6665490	eng	Tom said he's interested in learning how to do that.
6665491	eng	I'm already able to do that.
6665492	eng	Tom seems to really think that'll happen.
6665493	eng	I'm almost ready to do that.
6665494	eng	Tom says he can't wait that long.
6665495	eng	I'm able to do that as well.
6665496	eng	We all saw Tom doing that.
6665497	eng	I'll visit Boston next week.
6665498	eng	Tom told me that Mary would be desperate to do that.
6665499	eng	I'll teach you how to skate.
6665500	eng	Tom seems to really be in love with Mary.
6665501	eng	I'll start dieting tomorrow.
6665502	eng	Tom says that would never happen.
6665503	eng	I'll play football tomorrow.
6665504	eng	Tom's house wasn't locked.
6665505	eng	I'll lend you what you need.
6665506	eng	Tom told me that Mary would be motivated to do that.
6665507	eng	I'll leave as soon as I can.
6665508	eng	Tom seems to be really happy, doesn't he?
6665509	eng	I'll get dirty if I do that.
6665510	eng	Tom seemed busy, but Mary didn't.
6665511	eng	I'll be very busy next week.
6665512	eng	Tom's front door was open.
6665513	eng	I'll be too busy to do that.
6665514	eng	Tom told me that Mary would be reluctant to do that.
6665515	eng	I'll be thirteen next month.
6665516	eng	Tom seemed to have a good time in Boston.
6665517	eng	I'll be thirteen in October.
6665518	eng	Tom seemed to be unaware of that.
6665519	eng	I'll be staying for a while.
6665520	eng	Tom worked until midnight.
6665521	eng	I'll be ready to leave soon.
6665522	eng	Tom tried to pretend like he was having a good time.
6665523	eng	I'll be here this afternoon.
6665524	eng	Tom seemed to be really happy, didn't he?
6665525	eng	I'll be here for three days.
6665526	eng	Tom seems more relaxed than Mary.
6665527	eng	I'll be here for a few days.
6665528	eng	Tom will change his mind.
6665529	eng	I'd get fired if I did that.
6665530	eng	Tom understands French a lot better than he lets on.
6665531	eng	I won't be home next Monday.
6665532	eng	Tom saw something that he shouldn't have.
6665533	eng	I wasn't all that surprised.
6665534	eng	Tom seems to really like it here.
6665535	eng	I was late for school today.
6665536	eng	Tom went to get his stuff.
6665537	eng	I want to buy that painting.
6665538	eng	Tom very often makes mistakes when he speaks French.
6665539	eng	I want to buy a rice cooker.
6665540	eng	Tom said it didn't look like I was tired.
6665541	eng	I sometimes do that at home.
6665542	eng	Tom showed Mary where John lived.
6665543	eng	I seldom do that on Mondays.
6665544	eng	Tom went into the library.
6665545	eng	I need to finish this today.
6665546	eng	Tom wanted to be here, but he's at home sick in bed.
6665547	eng	I need a new pair of gloves.
6665548	eng	Tom said Mary didn't look very confident.
6665549	eng	I know every inch of Boston.
6665550	eng	Tom spilled his drink on himself.
6665551	eng	I just felt like doing that.
6665552	eng	Tom went inside the house.
6665553	eng	I hope you enjoy doing that.
6665554	eng	Tom was out there in the woods by himself all night.
6665555	eng	I hope to be famous someday.
6665556	eng	Tom said Mary didn't look like a teacher.
6665557	eng	I haven't broken my promise.
6665558	eng	Tom told Mary why he was leaving.
6665559	eng	I have some weird neighbors.
6665560	eng	Tom went home early today.
6665561	eng	I have blisters on my hands.
6665562	eng	Tom was present at today's meeting, but Mary wasn't.
6665563	eng	I have an old mahogany desk.
6665564	eng	Tom said Mary didn't look happy about it.
6665565	eng	I have a very stressful job.
6665566	eng	Tom used to be a tugboat captain.
6665567	eng	I have a son who's a doctor.
6665568	eng	Tom wasn't last. Mary was.
6665569	eng	I have a son and a daughter.
6665570	eng	Tom wasn't present at today's meeting, but Mary was.
6665571	eng	I have a son about your age.
6665572	eng	Tom quit that job after just three weeks.
6665573	eng	I have a pretty good memory.
6665574	eng	Tom was annoyed, but Mary wasn't.
6665575	eng	I have a lot to think about.
6665576	eng	Tom wanted to see monkeys.
6665577	eng	I have a lot of friends now.
6665578	eng	Tom went duck hunting with his friends last weekend.
6665579	eng	I have a grandson in Boston.
6665580	eng	Tom pretended that he didn't notice Mary.
6665581	eng	I have a degree in forestry.
6665582	eng	Tom was baffled, but Mary wasn't.
6665583	eng	I have a black belt in judo.
6665584	eng	Tom thought you knew Mary.
6665585	eng	I have a big test next week.
6665586	eng	Tom will have to leave if he doesn't behave himself.
6665587	eng	I have a bad hangover today.
6665588	eng	Tom picked an apple and handed it to Mary.
6665589	eng	I had my hair cut yesterday.
6665590	eng	Tom was careful, but Mary wasn't.
6665591	eng	I had good reason to be mad.
6665592	eng	Tom thought Mary was rich.
6665593	eng	I had another glass of wine.
6665594	eng	Tom won't be going to Boston with us, but Mary will.
6665595	eng	I had an accident in Boston.
6665596	eng	Tom noticed something weird was going on.
6665597	eng	I had all kinds of problems.
6665598	eng	Tom was curious, but Mary wasn't.
6665599	eng	I had a nice time in Boston.
6665600	eng	Tom stole Mary's umbrella.
6665601	eng	I had a bad cold last month.
6665602	eng	Tom won't likely do that unless Mary asks him to.
6665603	eng	I got thrown out of the bar.
6665604	eng	Tom needs to change the way he does that.
6665605	eng	I got the last piece of pie.
6665606	eng	Tom was excited, but Mary wasn't.
6665607	eng	I got the children to laugh.
6665608	eng	Tom stole Mary's passport.
6665609	eng	I got the chance to do that.
6665610	eng	What are Tom and I expected to do when we get there?
6665611	eng	I got stopped by the police.
6665612	eng	Tom must've left his umbrella on the bus.
6665613	eng	I got rid of my old bicycle.
6665614	eng	Tom was excused, but Mary wasn't.
6665615	eng	I got paid a lot to do that.
6665616	eng	Tom stayed inside all day.
6665617	eng	I got out of jail on Monday.
6665618	eng	When Tom was a child, he went to Boston three times.
6665619	eng	I got married to a Canadian.
6665620	eng	Tom moved the chair closer to the window.
6665621	eng	I got hurt when I fell down.
6665622	eng	Tom was frantic, but Mary wasn't.
6665623	eng	I got home just before 2:30.
6665624	eng	I got here just before 2:30.
6665625	eng	Whenever Tom comes to Boston, he stays at our house.
6665626	eng	I got back on my motorcycle.
6665627	eng	Tom looks like he really needs a holiday.
6665628	eng	I got back home before 2:30.
6665629	eng	Tom was furious, but Mary wasn't.
6665630	eng	I got a ticket for speeding.
6665631	eng	Tom should stay with Mary.
6665632	eng	I got a new pair of glasses.
6665633	eng	Would you like to see a picture of Tom hang gliding?
6665634	eng	I felt obligated to do that.
6665635	eng	Tom lit the candle that was on the table.
6665636	eng	I felt a tap on my shoulder.
6665637	eng	Tom was glad that Mary came over.
6665638	eng	I felt a little intimidated.
6665639	eng	Tom should listen to Mary.
6665640	eng	I feel obligated to do that.
6665641	eng	You don't seem convinced that Tom wanted to do that.
6665642	eng	I feel a little intimidated.
6665643	eng	Tom likes reading science fiction novels.
6665644	eng	I don't yet know what to do.
6665645	eng	Tom was grouchy, but Mary wasn't.
6665646	eng	I don't want to sell my car.
6665647	eng	I don't want to say goodbye.
6665648	eng	You don't seem to be as careless as Tom seems to be.
6665649	eng	I don't want to go home yet.
6665650	eng	Tom jumped at the chance to go to Boston.
6665651	eng	I don't want to go by train.
6665652	eng	Tom was helpful, but Mary wasn't.
6665653	eng	I don't want to change that.
6665654	eng	Tom seemed very concerned.
6665655	eng	I don't want to be like you.
6665656	eng	You don't seem to be as confused as Tom seems to be.
6665657	eng	I don't want to be a doctor.
6665658	eng	Tom isn't used to doing that in the dark.
6665659	eng	I don't usually wear makeup.
6665660	eng	Tom was nervous, but Mary wasn't.
6665661	eng	I don't think you'd do that.
6665662	eng	Tom seemed really worried.
6665663	eng	I don't think it's possible.
6665664	eng	You don't seem to be as creative as Tom seems to be.
6665665	eng	I don't really like oysters.
6665666	eng	Tom isn't likely to be in his office now.
6665667	eng	I don't really get out much.
6665668	eng	Tom was patient, but Mary wasn't.
6665669	eng	I don't play guitar anymore.
6665670	eng	Tom said that worried him.
6665671	eng	I don't often get depressed.
6665672	eng	You don't seem to be as gullible as Tom seems to be.
6665673	eng	I don't often do that alone.
6665674	eng	Tom isn't as hesitant to do that as I am.
6665675	eng	I don't live near my office.
6665676	eng	Tom was pleased, but Mary wasn't.
6665677	eng	I don't live here in Boston.
6665678	eng	Tom said he wasn't lonely.
6665679	eng	I don't know who stabbed me.
6665680	eng	You don't seem to be as homesick as Tom seems to be.
6665681	eng	I don't have much free time.
6665682	eng	Tom is the youngest student in our class.
6665683	eng	I don't enjoy watching golf.
6665684	eng	Tom was present, but Mary wasn't.
6665685	eng	I don't come here that much.
6665686	eng	Tom said he was all alone.
6665687	eng	You don't seem to be as stubborn as Tom seems to be.
6665688	eng	Tom is studying to be a graphic designer.
6665689	eng	I didn't hear any screaming.
6665690	eng	Tom was puzzled, but Mary wasn't.
6665691	epo	Ankaŭ Tomo igas min feliĉa.
6665692	nld	Ook Tom maakt me gelukkig.
6665693	eng	I didn't agree to come back.
6665694	eng	Tom said he needed a rest.
6665695	eng	I can't take care of myself.
6665696	eng	You don't seem to be as talented as Tom seems to be.
6665697	eng	I can't stop looking at you.
6665698	eng	Tom is still very much in love with Mary.
6665699	eng	I can't stay here by myself.
6665700	eng	Tom was serious, but Mary wasn't.
6665701	eng	I can't really do much else.
6665702	eng	Tom said he felt terrific.
6665703	eng	I can't handle this anymore.
6665704	eng	You don't seem to be doing what Tom asked you to do.
6665705	eng	I can't grow a mustache yet.
6665706	eng	Tom is still unconvinced, but Mary isn't.
6665707	eng	I can't get rid of my cough.
6665708	eng	Tom was shocked, but Mary wasn't.
6665709	eng	I can't get my car to start.
6665710	eng	Tom said he felt terrible.
6665711	eng	I can't eat food this spicy.
6665712	eng	You know Tom is very unlikely to do that, don't you?
6665713	eng	I can't comment on that now.
6665714	eng	Tom is returning from Australia tomorrow.
6665715	eng	I can't be so easily fooled.
6665716	eng	Tom was stunned, but Mary wasn't.
6665717	eng	I almost never win at chess.
6665718	eng	Tom said he felt repulsed.
6665719	eng	I almost never use my phone.
6665720	eng	Before I could say anything, Tom walked out the door.
6665721	eng	I almost never go to Boston.
6665722	eng	Tom is out there in the woods by himself.
6665723	eng	I almost never do that here.
6665724	eng	Tom was thirsty, but Mary wasn't.
6665725	eng	I almost became a paramedic.
6665726	eng	Tom said he felt relieved.
6665727	eng	I admitted I didn't do that.
6665728	eng	Could you please ask Tom if he's planning to help us?
6665729	eng	I admit that I've done that.
6665730	eng	Tom is the only one here planning to do that.
6665731	eng	Either I'm right or you are.
6665732	eng	Tom was trapped, but Mary wasn't.
6665733	eng	You don't seem to be happy.
6665734	eng	Tom said he felt rejected.
6665735	eng	You don't seem to be drunk.
6665736	eng	Do you really think Tom is the person we should hire?
6665737	eng	You don't look tired to me.
6665738	eng	Tom is one of the best guitarists I know.
6665739	eng	You don't look that strong.
6665740	eng	Tom was unlucky, but Mary wasn't.
6665741	eng	You don't look happy to me.
6665742	eng	Tom said he felt left out.
6665743	eng	These flowers are for Mary.
6665744	eng	Don't you think that Tom is too old to be doing that?
6665745	eng	That guy is looking at you.
6665746	eng	Tom is one of the best carpenters I know.
6665747	eng	Please don't be late again.
6665748	eng	Tom was worried, but Mary wasn't.
6665749	eng	Let me help you to do that.
6665750	eng	Tom said he felt homesick.
6665751	eng	I'm the one who left early.
6665752	eng	I advised Tom not to borrow too much money from Mary.
6665753	eng	I'm the one who called 911.
6665754	eng	Tom is in the garage, working on his car.
6665755	eng	I'm not having a good time.
6665756	eng	Tom was wrong and Mary was right.
6665757	eng	I'm not going to die, am I?
6665758	eng	Tom said he felt excluded.
6665759	eng	I'm going to try to escape.
6665760	eng	I advised Tom not to leave his windows open at night.
6665761	eng	I'm going to figure it out.
6665762	eng	Tom is going back to Australia next week.
6665763	eng	I'm going to do that today.
6665764	eng	Tom washed himself in the stream.
6665765	eng	I'm going to do that later.
6665766	eng	Tom said he felt confused.
6665767	eng	I'm going to do that alone.
6665768	eng	I advised Tom to take the money he was being offered.
6665769	eng	I'm going to call the cops.
6665770	eng	Tom is alone in his room, reading a book.
6665771	eng	I'm going to be late again.
6665772	eng	Tom wasn't as surprised as I was.
6665773	eng	I'm busy and can't do that.
6665774	eng	Tom said he felt betrayed.
6665775	eng	I'm at the top of my class.
6665776	eng	I can't remember the last time I ate dinner with Tom.
6665777	eng	I'm about ready to do that.
6665778	eng	Tom is worried about what might happen.
6665779	eng	I'll help as much as I can.
6665780	eng	Tom wasn't careful, but Mary was.
6665781	eng	I'll get up early tomorrow.
6665782	eng	Tom recognized Mary's dog.
6665783	eng	I'll call you this evening.
6665784	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so determined to do that.
6665785	eng	I'll be thirteen next year.
6665786	eng	Tom is a painter, but he's not very good.
6665787	eng	I'll be there this evening.
6665788	eng	Tom wasn't curious, but Mary was.
6665789	eng	I'll be lonely without you.
6665790	eng	Tom packed a bag and left.
6665791	eng	I'll be here all day today.
6665792	eng	I don't know exactly what time Tom is going to leave.
6665793	eng	I'll be busy tomorrow, too.
6665794	eng	Tom is a better bass player than Mary is.
6665795	eng	I'll be back in a few days.
6665796	eng	Tom wasn't excited, but Mary was.
6665797	eng	I'll be at today's meeting.
6665798	eng	Tom noticed something odd.
6665799	eng	I won't sign this contract.
6665800	eng	I don't know how much time it'll take Tom to do that.
6665801	eng	I think I've been betrayed.
6665802	eng	Tom has trouble controlling his emotions.
6665803	eng	I still don't know to swim.
6665804	eng	Tom wasn't furious, but Mary was.
6665805	eng	I should take one of these.
6665806	eng	Tom never works on Monday.
6665807	eng	I seldom do that by myself.
6665808	eng	I don't know when Tom and I are supposed to be there.
6665809	eng	I quickly ran out of money.
6665810	eng	Tom has locked himself out of his office.
6665811	eng	I often do that on Mondays.
6665812	eng	Tom wasn't grouchy, but Mary was.
6665813	eng	I often buy clothes online.
6665814	eng	Tom never drinks red wine.
6665815	eng	I often attend conferences.
6665816	eng	I don't like living in Boston and Tom doesn't either.
6665817	eng	I never was a good student.
6665818	eng	Tom has found another girlfriend already.
6665819	eng	I hope I don't get nervous.
6665820	eng	Tom wasn't helpful, but Mary was.
6665821	eng	I have blisters on my feet.
6665822	eng	Tom never cooks on Monday.
6665823	eng	I have a steady girlfriend.
6665824	eng	I don't need to know why Tom doesn't want to do that.
6665825	eng	I have a sister named Mary.
6665826	eng	Tom has everything a man could ever want.
6665827	eng	I have a safe in my office.
6665828	eng	Tom wasn't nervous, but Mary was.
6665829	eng	I have a right to be upset.
6665830	eng	Tom needs to take it easy.
6665831	eng	I have a right to be angry.
6665832	eng	I don't really have to go with Tom, but I'm going to.
6665833	eng	I have a possible solution.
6665834	eng	Tom has done that at least once, I think.
6665835	eng	I have a migraine headache.
6665836	eng	Tom wasn't patient, but Mary was.
6665837	eng	I have a mess to deal with.
6665838	eng	Tom loves being in Boston.
6665839	eng	I have many friends here.
6665840	eng	I don't think Tom can do what you've asked him to do.
6665841	eng	I have a lot of will power.
6665842	eng	Tom has decided to ask Mary to marry him.
6665843	eng	I have a lot of good ideas.
6665844	eng	Tom wasn't pleased, but Mary was.
6665845	eng	I have a lot of experience.
6665846	eng	Tom liked it in Australia.
6665847	eng	I have a lot of bad habits.
6665848	eng	I don't think Tom will be sleeping when we get there.
6665849	eng	I have a family to support.
6665850	eng	Tom has been here in Boston all his life.
6665851	eng	I have a degree in biology.
6665852	eng	Tom wasn't present, but Mary was.
6665853	eng	I have a couple of tattoos.
6665854	eng	Tom knows he can trust us.
6665855	eng	I have a chance of winning.
6665856	eng	I may be stubborn, but I'm not as stubborn as Tom is.
6665857	eng	I have a Canadian passport.
6665858	eng	Tom has been here at least once, I think.
6665859	eng	I had my secretary do that.
6665860	eng	Tom wasn't serious, but Mary was.
6665861	eng	I had good reason to worry.
6665862	eng	Tom knows he can trust me.
6665863	eng	I had a duplicate key made.
6665864	eng	I stopped what I was doing and turned to look at Tom.
6665865	eng	I got up and left the room.
6665866	eng	Tom has been hanging out with Mary a lot.
6665867	eng	I got to my office on time.
6665868	eng	Tom wasn't shocked, but Mary was.
6665869	eng	I got stung by a jellyfish.
6665870	eng	Tom knew that it was over.
6665871	eng	I got more than I expected.
6665872	eng	I thought Tom would be able to swim better than that.
6665873	eng	I got home at exactly 2:30.
6665874	eng	Tom has always been a bit of an idealist.
6665875	eng	I got here just after 2:30.
6665876	eng	Tom wasn't thirsty, but Mary was.
6665877	eng	I got fired for doing that.
6665878	eng	Tom knew he had hurt Mary.
6665879	eng	I got fined for doing that.
6665880	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't believe everything Mary says.
6665881	eng	I got expelled from school.
6665882	eng	Tom had to leave Mary at home by herself.
6665883	eng	I got a lot more than that.
6665884	eng	Tom wasn't trapped, but Mary was.
6665885	eng	I got a loan from the bank.
6665886	eng	Tom kissed Mary goodnight.
6665887	eng	I got a job as a carpenter.
6665888	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't buy anything from that store.
6665889	eng	I felt utterly overwhelmed.
6665890	eng	Tom feels really bad about what happened.
6665891	eng	I felt the rain on my face.
6665892	eng	Tom wasn't worried, but Mary was.
6665893	eng	I felt completely helpless.
6665894	eng	Tom isn't up, but Mary is.
6665895	eng	I don't yet know the truth.
6665896	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't go out after dark by himself.
6665897	eng	I don't want to wear jeans.
6665898	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to swim by herself.
6665899	eng	I don't want to go, either.
6665900	eng	Tom went to Boston for a funeral.
6665901	eng	I don't want to go hunting.
6665902	eng	Tom isn't really sleeping.
6665903	eng	I don't use a cane anymore.
6665904	eng	I warned Tom not to pitch his tent so near the river.
6665905	eng	I don't teach here anymore.
6665906	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to stay any longer.
6665907	eng	I don't often swim anymore.
6665908	eng	Tom will do that, but Mary won't.
6665909	eng	I don't often drink coffee.
6665910	eng	Tom isn't really a doctor.
6665911	eng	I don't like to eat onions.
6665912	eng	I went to the supermarket to buy some things for Tom.
6665913	eng	I don't like that too much.
6665914	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to leave the house.
6665915	eng	I don't like my stepmother.
6665916	eng	Tom will have to help me do that.
6665917	eng	I don't like being outside.
6665918	eng	Tom isn't in, but Mary is.
6665919	eng	I don't know the truth yet.
6665920	eng	I'd already bought my ticket by the time Tom arrived.
6665921	eng	I don't have a rice cooker.
6665922	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to call the police.
6665923	eng	I don't go fishing anymore.
6665924	eng	Tom worked here for three months.
6665925	eng	I don't fit in here at all.
6665926	eng	Tom isn't from a big city.
6665927	eng	I don't ever walk anywhere.
6665928	eng	I'm the one who taught Tom how to play the saxophone.
6665929	eng	I don't eat rice every day.
6665930	eng	Tom doesn't understand what we're saying.
6665931	eng	I don't drink beer at home.
6665932	eng	Tom's car must've cost him a lot.
6665933	eng	I don't care how you dress.
6665934	eng	Tom isn't as ugly as Mary.
6665935	eng	I didn't say anything else.
6665936	eng	I haven't been to Boston as many times as Tom has.
6665937	eng	I didn't get enough to eat.
6665938	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as stupid as Mary.
6665939	eng	I can't survive here alone.
6665940	eng	Tom's son has run away from home.
6665941	eng	I can't meet you on Monday.
6665942	eng	Tom isn't as thin as I am.
6665943	eng	I can't get this door open.
6665944	eng	If I'd known Tom's phone number, I'd have called him.
6665945	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as strong as Mary.
6665946	eng	I can't decide where to go.
6665947	eng	We need to discuss that with Tom.
6665948	eng	I can't decide what to buy.
6665949	eng	Tom isn't as slow as I am.
6665950	eng	I can't come to work today.
6665951	eng	It looked like Tom wanted to say more, but he didn't.
6665952	eng	I almost spilled my coffee.
6665953	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as direct as Mary.
6665954	eng	I almost never get nervous.
6665955	eng	What happened changed Tom's life.
6665956	eng	I almost never eat dessert.
6665957	eng	Tom isn't as sick as I am.
6665958	eng	I almost never eat chicken.
6665959	eng	Let's go over to Tom's house and see what he's doing.
6665960	eng	I almost always wear a hat.
6665961	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as bright as Mary.
6665962	eng	I almost agreed to do that.
6665963	eng	Why do you think Tom is so angry?
6665964	eng	Don't go there by yourself.
6665965	eng	Tom isn't as rich as I am.
6665966	eng	You sound like an old man.
6665967	eng	Let's go over to Tom's place and see what he's doing.
6665968	eng	You need to get here soon.
6665969	eng	Tom doesn't know why Mary and I are here.
6665970	eng	You have to buy this, too.
6665971	eng	You don't want Tom to go, do you?
6665972	eng	You don't seem to be busy.
6665973	eng	Tom isn't as poor as I am.
6665974	eng	You don't seem interested.
6665975	eng	That must've happened while Tom and I were in Boston.
6665976	eng	Would you help me do this?
6665977	eng	Tom doesn't know how to start a campfire.
6665978	eng	Please turn the radio off.
6665979	eng	You think Tom is cute, don't you?
6665980	eng	Let's play a different game.
6665981	eng	Tom isn't as neat as I am.
6665982	eng	Let me carry that for you.
6665983	eng	The last time I saw Tom, he was headed for the beach.
6665984	eng	Is the zoo open on Monday?
6665985	eng	Tom doesn't have very many close friends.
6665986	eng	I'm very happy I did that.
6665987	eng	Ask Tom if he's going out tonight.
6665988	eng	I'm the one who does that.
6665989	eng	Tom isn't as busy as I am.
6665990	eng	I'm not carrying a weapon.
6665991	eng	The person Tom and I were waiting for didn't turn up.
6665992	eng	I'm going to get divorced.
6665993	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to drive home drunk.
6665994	eng	I'm going to do that, too.
6665995	eng	Could you please help Tom do that?
6665996	eng	I'm going to do that soon.
6665997	eng	Tom isn't as bald as I am.
6665998	eng	I'm going to deal with it.
6665999	eng	The policeman handcuffed Tom's hands behind his back.
6666000	eng	I'm going to come get you.
6666001	eng	Tom didn't seem to be as relaxed as Mary.
6666002	eng	I'm going to come by taxi.
6666003	eng	Didn't Tom ask you not to do that?
6666004	eng	I'm going to be just fine.
6666005	eng	Tom isn't OK, but Mary is.
6666006	eng	I'm going to be in charge.
6666007	eng	This is a picture of Tom and I when we were students.
6666008	eng	I'm going to be home soon.
6666009	eng	Tom didn't seem interested in doing that.
6666010	eng	I'm going to be done soon.
6666011	eng	Do Tom and I have to do that, too?
6666012	eng	I'm going to be back soon.
6666013	eng	Tom is young and handsome.
6666014	eng	I'm being made to do that.
6666015	eng	This is a picture of the ship that Tom and I were on.
6666016	eng	I'm also going to do that.
6666017	eng	Tom didn't go to John and Mary's wedding.
6666018	eng	I'll study French tonight.

6666021	eng	Tom is working three jobs.
6666022	eng	I'll play soccer tomorrow.

6666038	eng	I'll be back this evening.
6666039	eng	Tom always drinks his coffee black and without sugar.
6666040	eng	I'll be back around 2:30.
6666041	eng	Tom ate something that he shouldn't have.
6666042	eng	I wish you'd quit whining.
6666043	eng	I advised Tom to consult a lawyer.
6666044	eng	I wasn't able to fix that.
6666045	eng	Tom is up, but Mary isn't.
6666046	eng	I usually do that at home.
6666047	eng	Tom always eats breakfast, but Mary hardly ever does.
6666048	eng	I think that's a bad idea.
6666049	eng	Tom asked why he was required to do that.
6666050	eng	I sometimes do that alone.
6666051	eng	I advised Tom to go to the police.
6666052	eng	I plan to keep my promise.
6666053	eng	Tom is thirteen years old.
6666054	eng	I often do that by myself.
6666055	eng	Tom and I are the only ones who are going to do that.
6666056	eng	I never said such a thing.
6666057	eng	Tom asked me to tell Mary why I did that.
6666058	eng	I have some more bad news.
6666059	eng	I advised Tom to keep his promise.

6666112	eng	I got a haircut yesterday.
6666113	eng	Tom and Mary talked about what they were going to do.
6666114	eng	I got a chance to do that.

6666228	eng	I'm going to college now.
6666229	eng	I don't like Tom's sense of humor.
6666230	eng	I'm going to change that.
6666231	eng	Tom has to tell the truth.
6666232	eng	I'm going to beat you up.
6666233	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as bright as Mary seems to be.
6666234	eng	I'm able to do that, too.
6666235	eng	The cake that Tom made didn't taste good.
6666236	eng	I'll try again next week.
6666237	eng	I don't mind helping Tom a little.
6666238	eng	I'll stay here till 2:30.
6666239	eng	Tom has had a bad morning.
6666240	eng	I'll stay here all month.
6666241	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as forgetful as he used to be.
6666242	eng	I'll see you next Monday.
6666243	eng	Some people say that Tom and I are weird.
6666244	eng	I'll do that later today.
6666245	eng	I don't study as much as Tom does.
6666246	eng	I'll do that after lunch.
6666247	eng	Tom has changed his plans.
6666248	eng	I'll buy the cheaper one.
6666249	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as greedy as Mary seems to be.
6666250	eng	I'll be thirty next year.
6666251	eng	Please ask Tom if he's going out tonight.
6666252	eng	I'll be on duty tomorrow.
6666253	eng	I don't think I'd let Tom do that.
6666254	eng	I'll be home by midnight.
6666255	eng	Tom has been lying to you.
6666256	eng	I'll be here three weeks.
6666257	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as scared as Mary seems to be.
6666258	eng	I'll be here all evening.
6666259	eng	Next year, Tom and I are going to Boston.
6666260	eng	I'll be back later today.
6666261	eng	I don't think Tom is conservative.
6666262	eng	I'd be scared to do that.
6666263	eng	Tom has been eating a lot.
6666264	eng	I won't buy that for you.
6666265	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as sleepy as Mary seems to be.
6666266	eng	I won't be able to fix that.
6666267	eng	Next week, Tom and I are going to Boston.
6666268	eng	I was the first one here.
6666269	eng	I don't think Tom is disorganized.
6666270	eng	I usually get up at 6:30.
6666271	eng	Tom has altered his plans.
6666272	eng	I sometimes do that here.
6666273	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be as stupid as Mary seems to be.
6666274	eng	I seldom do that at home.
6666275	eng	It would be better if Tom didn't do that.
6666276	eng	I hope I didn't bore you.
6666277	eng	I don't think Tom was embarrassed.
6666278	eng	I have to work on Monday.
6666279	eng	Tom grew up on this ranch.
6666280	eng	I have to study tomorrow.
6666281	eng	Tom encouraged Mary to write a letter to her parents.
6666282	eng	I have a younger brother.
6666283	eng	If Tom and I are late, don't wait for us.
6666284	eng	I have a terrible memory.
6666285	eng	I don't think Tom was sympathetic.
6666286	eng	I have a store in Boston.
6666287	eng	Tom got very good at singing.
6666288	eng	I have a similar problem.
6666289	eng	Tom folded the blankets and put them into the closet.
6666290	eng	I have a rock collection.
6666291	eng	I've forgotten how to get to Tom's place.
6666292	eng	I have a lot on my plate.
6666293	eng	I don't think Tom will be present.
6666294	eng	I have a lot of property.
6666295	eng	Tom got run over by a car.
6666296	eng	I have a fairly good job.
6666297	eng	Tom has already taken Mary's suitcase out to the car.
6666298	eng	I have a criminal record.
6666299	eng	I'm the one who told Tom where you lived.
6666300	eng	I have a cramp in my leg.
6666301	eng	I don't think Tom will likely cry.
6666302	eng	I had no time to do that.
6666303	eng	Tom got pretty good at it.
6666304	eng	I got shampoo in my eyes.
6666305	eng	Tom has his ex-girlfriend's name tattooed on his arm.
6666306	eng	I got promoted last week.
6666307	eng	I'm the one who told Tom to stay at home.
6666308	eng	I got out of the taxicab.
6666309	eng	I don't want to see Tom right now.
6666310	eng	I got out of the bathtub.
6666311	eng	Tom got out of the shower.
6666312	eng	I got married very young.
6666313	eng	Tom has lied to me in the past, so I don't trust him.
6666314	eng	I got married last month.
6666315	eng	I'm the one who helped Tom the other day.
6666316	eng	I got it wrong, didn't I?
6666317	eng	I don't yet know what Tom will do.
6666318	eng	I got here at about 2:30.
6666319	eng	Tom got lost in the crowd.
6666320	eng	I got attacked by a bear.
6666321	eng	Tom is enthusiastic about doing that, but Mary isn't.
6666322	eng	I got a standing ovation.
6666323	eng	I'm not as hesitant to do that as Tom is.
6666324	eng	I forgot to lock my bike.
6666325	eng	I got into trouble because of Tom.
6666326	eng	I felt obligated to help.
6666327	eng	Tom got extremely jealous.
6666328	eng	I felt a little left out.
6666329	eng	Tom is old enough to get a senior citizen's discount.
6666330	eng	I feel obligated to help.
6666331	eng	I'm going to discuss that with Tom later.
6666332	eng	I don't want to sit down.
6666333	eng	I guess Tom and I are getting old.
6666334	eng	I don't want to be found.
6666335	eng	Tom drives a Japanese car.
6666336	eng	I don't want to be first.
6666337	eng	Tom may look smart, but he's actually not very smart.
6666338	eng	I don't want to be fired.
6666339	eng	I'm going to ask Tom to do that for Mary.
6666340	eng	I don't think you'll win.
6666341	eng	I had a date with Tom last Monday.
6666342	eng	I don't think we can win.
6666343	eng	Tom doesn't usually snore.
6666344	eng	I don't think it'll snow.
6666345	eng	Tom said I didn't look like I was having a good time.
6666346	eng	I don't think I did that.
6666347	eng	I'll try to do that before Tom gets here.
6666348	eng	I don't smoke cigarettes.
6666349	eng	I have no idea where Tom did that.
6666350	eng	I don't see it like that.
6666351	eng	Tom didn't steal anything.
6666352	eng	I don't plan to be there.
6666353	eng	Tom said I don't need to do anything I don't want to.
6666354	eng	I don't often drink beer.
6666355	eng	I'll tell Tom what to say at the meeting.
6666356	eng	I don't need to go there.
6666357	eng	I haven't discussed that with Tom.
6666358	eng	I don't need to be there.
6666359	eng	Tom didn't show up at all.
6666360	eng	I don't mind getting wet.
6666361	eng	Tom said Mary didn't look like either of her parents.
6666362	eng	I don't live near I work.
6666363	eng	I'll tell Tom what he should say to Mary.
6666364	eng	I don't like to be early.
6666365	eng	I haven't seen Tom do that before.
6666366	eng	I don't like tennis much.
6666367	eng	Tom didn't drink anything.
6666368	eng	I don't like sports much.
6666369	eng	Tom said it didn't look like Mary was having any fun.
6666370	eng	I don't know who shot me.
6666371	eng	I'll give this book back to Tom tomorrow.
6666372	eng	I don't know much either.
6666373	eng	I hope Tom doesn't try to kiss me.
6666374	eng	I don't have what I need.
6666375	eng	Tom couldn't pay his rent.
6666376	eng	I don't have the tickets.
6666377	eng	Tom said it looked like Mary wasn't enjoying herself.
6666378	eng	I don't do that that way.
6666379	eng	I'll be surprised if Tom doesn't do that.
6666380	eng	I don't believe I'll win.
6666381	eng	I like Tom's straight-forwardness.
6666382	eng	I deserve another chance.
6666383	eng	Tom couldn't contact Mary.
6666384	eng	I can't wait to graduate.
6666385	eng	Tom said that was the first time he tried to do that.
6666386	eng	I can't tie my shoelaces.
6666387	eng	I wish I could get Tom to do that for me.
6666388	eng	I can't tie my own shoes.
6666389	eng	I saw Tom standing in the doorway.
6666390	eng	I can't stand loud music.
6666391	eng	Tom can't go to the dance.
6666392	eng	I can't speak any French.
6666393	eng	Tom says I don't need to go there if I don't want to.
6666394	eng	I can't seem to ever win.
6666395	eng	I told Tom to leave early in the morning.
6666396	eng	I can't buy that for you.
6666397	eng	I should've told Tom not to smoke.
6666398	eng	I can't believe our luck.
6666399	eng	Tom began to yell at Mary.
6666400	eng	I almost never eat fruit.
6666401	eng	Tom stared out of the window, watching the snow fall.
6666402	eng	I almost lost my balance.
6666403	eng	I told Tom that I understood how he felt.
6666404	eng	I almost forgot my money.
6666405	eng	I think Tom is still under thirty.
6666406	eng	I almost died that night.
6666407	eng	Tom became very talkative.
6666408	eng	I almost died last night.
6666409	eng	Tom stopped what he was doing and answered his phone.
6666410	eng	I admit I didn't do that.
6666411	eng	I told Tom not to stay out late at night.
6666412	eng	Does this look OK to you?
6666413	eng	I think we should let Tom do that.
6666414	eng	Did your interview go OK?
6666415	eng	Tom became very skeptical.
6666416	eng	Boston is worth visiting.
6666417	eng	Tom taught French in Boston before moving to Chicago.
6666418	eng	You'll feel better soon.
6666419	eng	I told Tom not to go to Boston with Mary.
6666420	eng	You don't seem to agree.
6666421	eng	I told Tom he should buy that car.
6666422	eng	You don't look too sure.
6666423	eng	Tom became very irritated.
6666424	eng	You don't look thrilled.
6666425	eng	Tom told me that Mary would be determined to do that.
6666426	eng	That noise irritates me.
6666427	eng	I told Tom not to believe what Mary said.
6666428	eng	My wife is an alcoholic.
6666429	eng	I told Tom he should learn karate.
6666430	eng	Let's go out for dinner.
6666431	eng	Tom became very impatient.
6666432	eng	Let me fix that for you.
6666433	eng	Tom told me that he didn't remember Mary's last name.
6666434	eng	I'm going to get better.
6666435	eng	I told Tom he should go there by bicycle.
6666436	eng	I'm going to come later.
6666437	eng	I told Tom he should stay at home.
6666438	eng	I'm going to come early.
6666439	eng	Tom became very disgusted.
6666440	eng	I'm expected to do that.
6666441	eng	Tom told me that he just needed a shoulder to cry on.
6666442	eng	I'm able to do that now.
6666443	eng	I told Tom he should eat more vegetables.
6666444	eng	I'll take both of these.
6666445	eng	I told Tom he should take a break.
6666446	eng	I'll stay until the end.
6666447	eng	Tom became very desperate.
6666448	eng	I'll help you all I can.
6666449	eng	Tom walked out of the store, carrying three packages.
6666450	eng	I'll graduate next year.
6666451	eng	I thought Tom was going to help us today.
6666452	eng	I'll give you this book.
6666453	eng	I told Tom he should take the job.
6666454	eng	I'll be working tonight.
6666455	eng	Tom became very depressed.
6666456	eng	I'll be there very soon.
6666457	eng	Tom was amused by what was going on, but Mary wasn't.
6666458	eng	I'll be here until noon.
6666459	eng	I think Tom should've been more discreet.
6666460	eng	I'll be back home soon.
6666461	eng	I told Tom to eat more vegetables.
6666462	eng	I'd prefer to go by car.
6666463	eng	Tom became very concerned.
6666464	eng	I won't try to stop you.
6666465	eng	Tom was difficult to get along with, but Mary wasn't.
6666466	eng	I won't allow you to go.
6666467	eng	I should've agreed to ask Tom to do that.
6666468	eng	I was sick last weekend.
6666469	eng	I told Tom to go there by bicycle.
6666470	eng	I usually do that alone.
6666471	eng	Tom asked me to find Mary.
6666472	eng	I tend to forget things.
6666473	eng	Tom was finished doing that by 2:30, but Mary wasn't.
6666474	eng	I often do that at home.
6666475	eng	I should've agreed to accept Tom's offer.
6666476	eng	I never do that at home.
6666477	eng	I urged Tom to apply for that job.
6666478	eng	I have two teenage sons.
6666479	eng	Tom asked if I liked math.
6666480	eng	I have an upset stomach.
6666481	eng	Tom was sitting at a table near the window with Mary.
6666482	eng	I have a younger sister.
6666483	eng	I reached out and touched Tom's shoulder.
6666484	eng	I have a scar on my arm.
6666485	eng	I used to get along well with Tom.
6666486	eng	I have a plane to catch.
6666487	eng	Tom asked if I liked Mary.
6666488	eng	I have a nice apartment.
6666489	eng	Tom wasn't able to do everything he promised he'd do.
6666490	eng	I have a lot on my mind.
6666491	eng	I hope Tom doesn't tell Mary what we did.
6666492	eng	I have a lot of enemies.
6666493	eng	I wish I could get Tom to do that.
6666494	eng	I have a lot of clothes.
6666495	eng	Tom and Mary are retirees.
6666496	eng	I have a gym membership.
6666497	eng	Tom wasn't able to make himself understood in French.
6666498	eng	I have a gun collection.
6666499	eng	I have no idea why Tom wished to do that.
6666500	eng	I have a grown daughter.
6666501	eng	I wish I had more pictures of Tom.
6666502	eng	I have a date on Monday.
6666503	eng	Tom and I seldom disagree.
6666504	eng	I have a cut on my foot.
6666505	eng	Tom wasn't amused by what was going on, but Mary was.
6666506	eng	I have a bit of a fever.
6666507	eng	I have no idea when Tom wants to do that.
6666508	eng	I had my hearing tested.
6666509	eng	I wonder if Tom is waiting for me.
6666510	eng	I had another operation.
6666511	eng	Tom and I aren't sleeping.
6666512	eng	I had a lot of problems.
6666513	eng	Tom wasn't difficult to get along with, but Mary was.
6666514	eng	I had a bad day at work.
6666515	eng	I have no idea when Tom needs to do that.
6666516	eng	I got sick last weekend.
6666517	eng	I wonder what Tom is thinking now.
6666518	eng	I got promoted recently.
6666519	eng	Tom and I aren't prepared.
6666520	eng	I got my teeth whitened.
6666521	eng	Tom wasn't finished doing that by 2:30, but Mary was.
6666522	eng	I got my hearing tested.
6666523	eng	I have no idea what Tom's dog looks like.
6666524	eng	I got married last week.
6666525	eng	I wonder why Tom is so aggressive.
6666526	eng	I got here before Tom did.
6666527	eng	Tom and I aren't done yet.
6666528	eng	I got fired from my job.
6666529	eng	Tom's lights were out, so I didn't knock on his door.
6666530	eng	I got back into the car.
6666531	eng	I have a watch just like the one Tom has.
6666532	eng	I got a speeding ticket.
6666533	eng	I wonder why Tom is so busy today.
6666534	eng	I felt quite threatened.
6666535	eng	Tom and I aren't dead yet.
6666536	eng	I felt alone in the bar.
6666537	eng	We showed Tom some of the pictures we took in Boston.
6666538	eng	I felt a little nervous.
6666539	eng	I have a feeling that Tom might be there.
6666540	eng	I feel much happier now.
6666541	eng	I'll be very mad if Tom does that.
6666542	eng	I feel a little nervous.
6666543	eng	Tom and I aren't children.
6666544	eng	I don't wish to do that.
6666545	eng	When Tom was in the hospital, he read a lot of books.
6666546	eng	I don't think we'll win.
6666547	eng	I had no idea what Tom was talking about.
6666548	eng	I don't sing very often.
6666549	eng	I'll be with Tom all day tomorrow.
6666550	eng	I don't plan to give up.
6666551	eng	Tom and I are really busy.
6666552	eng	I don't love my husband.
6666553	eng	Why are Tom and I always the ones who have to suffer?
6666554	eng	I don't like smoky bars.
6666555	eng	I had no idea that Tom wanted to do that.
6666556	eng	I don't like salty food.
6666557	eng	I'll sit wait until Tom gets here.
6666558	eng	I don't like my new job.
6666559	eng	Tom always asks about you.
6666560	eng	I don't like being here.
6666561	eng	You don't seem to be as ambitious as Tom seems to be.
6666562	eng	I don't know how to ski.
6666563	eng	I had a crush on Tom when I was thirteen.
6666564	eng	I don't have a visa yet.
6666565	eng	I'll tell Tom about what happened.
6666566	eng	I don't have a basement.
6666567	eng	Tom almost never helps us.
6666568	eng	I don't get this at all.
6666569	eng	You don't seem to be as assertive as Tom seems to be.
6666570	eng	I don't carry much cash.
6666571	eng	I got mad at Tom for not listening to me.
6666572	eng	I can't stand punk rock.
6666573	eng	I'll tell Tom to do that for Mary.
6666574	eng	I can't really help you.
6666575	eng	Tom almost killed himself.
6666576	eng	I can't make it tonight.
6666577	eng	You don't seem to be as committed as Tom seems to be.
6666578	eng	I can't find a good job.
6666579	eng	I got back in the car and waited for Tom.
6666580	eng	I can't believe my luck.
6666581	eng	I'll tell Tom what has to be done.
6666582	eng	I almost never eat pork.
6666583	eng	These cookies are for Tom.
6666584	eng	I almost never eat meat.
6666585	eng	You don't seem to be as concerned as Tom seems to be.
6666586	eng	I almost never eat fish.
6666587	eng	I got Tom to do what we wanted him to do.
6666588	eng	I almost never eat beef.
6666589	eng	I'll tell Tom what he needs to do.
6666590	eng	I almost never did that.
6666591	eng	These books are all Tom's.
6666592	eng	I almost froze to death.
6666593	eng	You don't seem to be as confident as Tom seems to be.
6666594	eng	I admit I sometimes cry.
6666595	eng	I don't yet know what Tom is going to do.
6666596	eng	I admit I often do that.
6666597	eng	I'll try to keep Tom from leaving.
6666598	eng	Do you have Mondays off?
6666599	eng	That isn't what Tom wants.
6666600	eng	Are they open on Monday?
6666601	eng	You don't seem to be as depressed as Tom seems to be.
6666602	eng	All I want is the truth.
6666603	eng	I don't want Tom to go to Boston with us.
6666604	eng	You'll be missed a lot.
6666605	eng	I'll try to stop Tom from leaving.
6666606	eng	You don't seem to care.
6666607	eng	Tell me why Tom is crying.
6666608	eng	You don't look pleased.
6666609	eng	You don't seem to be as desperate as Tom seems to be.
6666610	eng	You don't look nervous.
6666611	eng	I don't understand why Tom acts that way.
6666612	eng	What's in that package?
6666613	eng	I'm better at doing that than Tom.
6666614	eng	Please help me do this.
6666615	eng	Maybe Tom and I are wrong.
6666616	eng	Let me give you a ride.
6666617	eng	You don't seem to be as exhausted as Tom seems to be.
6666618	eng	Let me get you a towel.
6666619	eng	I don't think what Tom said was accurate.
6666620	eng	It's time to start now.
6666621	eng	I'm going to allow Tom to do that.
6666622	eng	It was hard to do that.
6666623	eng	Let's let Tom handle that.
6666624	eng	It was easy to do that.
6666625	eng	You don't seem to be as impatient as Tom seems to be.
6666626	eng	I've just eaten dinner.
6666627	eng	I don't think Tom will be home on Monday.
6666628	eng	I've agreed to do that.
6666629	eng	I'm going to come back to get Tom.
6666630	eng	I'm so glad I did that.
6666631	eng	Let's go fishing with Tom.
6666632	eng	I'm happy you did that.
6666633	eng	You don't seem to be as impressed as Tom seems to be.
6666634	eng	I'm good at doing that.
6666635	eng	I don't think Tom will be busy next week.
6666636	eng	I'm going to be a cook.
6666637	eng	I'm happy as long as Tom is happy.
6666638	eng	I'm going to bat third.
6666639	eng	Isn't that Tom's umbrella?
6666640	eng	I'm doing that already.
6666641	eng	You don't seem to be as irritated as Tom seems to be.
6666642	eng	I'm anxious to do that.
6666643	eng	I don't think Tom was through doing that.
6666644	eng	I'm already doing that.
6666645	eng	I'm the one who does that for Tom.
6666646	eng	I'm allowed to do that.
6666647	eng	Isn't that Tom's daughter?
6666648	eng	I'm a little bit scared.
6666649	eng	You don't seem to be as miserable as Tom seems to be.
6666650	eng	I'll wash my car today.
6666651	eng	I don't think Tom was tempted to do that.
6666652	eng	I'll leave when you do.
6666653	eng	I'm tired of hanging out with Tom.
6666654	eng	I'll be here till 2:30.
6666655	eng	I've agreed to let Tom go.
6666656	eng	I'll be here on Monday.
6666657	eng	You don't seem to be as motivated as Tom seems to be.
6666658	eng	I'll be here next week.
6666659	eng	I don't think Tom needs to do that today.
6666660	eng	I've agreed to accept Tom's offer.
6666661	eng	I wish I could go, too.
6666662	eng	I'm not as fast as Tom is.
6666663	eng	I was bored, so I left.
6666664	eng	You don't seem to be as organized as Tom seems to be.
6666665	eng	I usually do that here.
6666666	eng	I don't think Tom is old enough to drive.
6666667	eng	I seldom do that alone.
6666668	eng	I've agreed to ask Tom to do that.
6666669	eng	I'm not so busy nowadays.
6666670	eng	I'm going to buy Tom that.
6666671	eng	I have to do that, too.
6666672	eng	You'll be surprised when you see how tall Tom is now.
6666673	eng	I have a terrible cold.
6666674	eng	I don't think Tom is old enough to drink.
6666675	eng	I have a swimming pool.
6666676	eng	It looked like Tom was having fun.
6666677	eng	I have a stressful job.
6666678	eng	I waxed Tom's car for him.
6666679	eng	I have a lot of energy.
6666680	eng	I advised Tom not to waste his time trying to do that.
6666681	eng	I have a large bedroom.
6666682	eng	I don't think Tom is good enough for you.
6666683	eng	I have a decent salary.
6666684	eng	It seems Tom is telling the truth.
6666685	eng	I have a black bicycle.
6666686	eng	I told Tom to work harder.
6666687	eng	I have a big apartment.
6666688	eng	I can't afford to buy the car Tom thinks I should buy.
6666689	eng	I had dinner by myself.
6666690	eng	I don't think Tom is as creative as Mary.
6666691	eng	I had a really bad day.
6666692	eng	Maybe Tom and I are both mistaken.
6666693	eng	I got up an hour early.
6666694	eng	I told Tom to leave early.
6666695	eng	I got this for nothing.
6666696	eng	I didn't want Tom to go to Boston, but he went anyway.
6666697	eng	I got the job I wanted.
6666698	eng	I don't think I'll permit Tom to do that.
6666699	eng	I got the answer right.
6666700	eng	My favorite singer is Tom Jackson.
6666701	eng	I got stuck in the mud.
6666702	eng	I told Tom to be punctual.
6666703	eng	I got poked in the eye.
6666704	eng	I don't believe Tom really plans to do that this week.
6666705	eng	I got out of the water.
6666706	eng	I don't think I need to help Tom anymore.
6666707	eng	I got off the elevator.
6666708	eng	None of Tom's classmates likes him.
6666709	eng	I got kicked by a mule.
6666710	eng	I told Tom he should rest.
6666711	eng	I got home around 2:30.
6666712	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to meet him in the park.
6666713	eng	I got here before noon.
6666714	eng	I don't remember seeing Tom at the party.
6666715	eng	I got back into my car.
6666716	eng	None of Tom's friends can do that.
6666717	eng	I felt like an outcast.
6666718	eng	I think Tom is just tired.
6666719	eng	I felt a little guilty.
6666720	eng	I don't think I'll be able to convince Tom to do that.
6666721	eng	I feel like going home.
6666722	eng	I don't like the kind of music Tom plays.
6666723	eng	I feel like an outcast.
6666724	eng	Tell Tom what he's supposed to do.
6666725	eng	I don't want to try it.
6666726	eng	I seldom do that with Tom.
6666727	eng	I don't think I'll win.
6666728	eng	I don't think Tom is smart enough to get into Harvard.
6666729	eng	I don't own a computer.
6666730	eng	I don't like it when you and Tom do that.
6666731	eng	I don't like green tea.
6666732	eng	That's not why Tom and I are here.
6666733	eng	I don't know who's who.
6666734	eng	I see Tom is still asleep.
6666735	eng	I don't have seniority.
6666736	eng	I don't think Tom will be awake at this time of night.
6666737	eng	I don't have a husband.
6666738	eng	I don't like Tom, but I like his brother.
6666739	eng	I don't give up easily.
6666740	eng	Tom and I are better than you are.
6666741	eng	I don't eat much fruit.
6666742	eng	I often ask Tom questions.
6666743	eng	I don't do that at all.
6666744	eng	I don't think Tom will be in his office tomorrow morning.
6666745	eng	I don't care who comes.
6666746	eng	I don't know why Tom wants me to do that.
6666747	eng	I can't play the flute.
6666748	eng	Tom and I are faster than you are.
6666749	eng	I can't leave just yet.
6666750	eng	I heard that Tom was dead.
6666751	eng	I ate dinner by myself.
6666752	eng	I don't think Tom would be surprised if Mary did that.
6666753	eng	I almost never eat out.
6666754	eng	I don't know why Tom wants Mary to leave.
6666755	eng	I almost never ask why.
6666756	eng	Tom and I weren't here last night.
6666757	eng	I admit I wasn't happy.
6666758	eng	I have a cousin named Tom.
6666759	eng	Do you have Monday off?
6666760	eng	I don't think you can convince Tom to stop doing that.
6666761	eng	Boston is a large city.
6666762	eng	I don't know why Tom doesn't like Boston.
6666763	eng	Are you open on Monday?
6666764	eng	Tom and Mary broke up a while ago.
6666765	eng	Are you free on Monday?
6666766	eng	I had Tom paint the fence.
6666767	eng	Are these your glasses?
6666768	eng	I got a book down from the shelf and handed it to Tom.
6666769	eng	You need to get going.
6666770	eng	I don't know what Tom is doing out there.
6666771	eng	You don't seem hungry.
6666772	eng	Tom arrived from Boston yesterday.
6666773	eng	You don't need to pay.
6666774	eng	I got in the car with Tom.
6666775	eng	You don't look scared.
6666776	eng	I got mad at Tom because he was making a lot of noise.
6666777	eng	You can borrow my pen.
6666778	eng	I don't know if Tom likes spinach or not.
6666779	eng	Tom arrived in Boston last Monday.
6666780	eng	We'll really miss you.
6666781	eng	I felt really bad for Tom.
6666782	eng	My handbag was stolen.
6666783	eng	I had a crush on Tom when I was in junior high school.
6666784	eng	May I sit next to you?
6666785	eng	I don't know how much time Tom will need.
6666786	eng	Let's go out and play.
6666787	eng	Tom asked Mary to go talk to John.
6666788	eng	Let me get you a beer.
6666789	eng	I don't trust Tom one bit.
6666790	eng	I've just eaten lunch.
6666791	eng	I have a daughter that goes to the same school as Tom.
6666792	eng	I'm going to fix this.
6666793	eng	I don't know for sure when Tom will come.
6666794	eng	I'm going to fix that.
6666795	eng	Tom asked me if I could help Mary.
6666796	eng	I'm going to be alone.
6666797	eng	I don't think Tom was shy.
6666798	eng	I'm bad at doing that.
6666799	eng	I have no idea why Tom wanted Mary to stop doing that.
6666800	eng	I'll go there for you.
6666801	eng	I don't have any friends here except Tom.
6666802	eng	I'll be there as well.
6666803	eng	Tom asked me to help Mary do that.
6666804	eng	I'll be free tomorrow.
6666805	eng	I don't think Tom was mad.
6666806	eng	I saw the way Tom and Mary were looking at each other.
6666807	eng	I don't feel like talking to Tom tonight.
6666808	eng	I still don't do that.
6666809	eng	Tom asked why Mary had to do that.
6666810	eng	I seldom do that here.
6666811	eng	I don't think Tom is weak.
6666812	eng	I often get home late.
6666813	eng	I should've advised Tom not to believe what Mary says.
6666814	eng	I often do that alone.
6666815	eng	I don't ever go camping with Tom anymore.
6666816	eng	I never do that alone.
6666817	eng	Tom bought himself a new computer.
6666818	eng	I have a step-brother.
6666819	eng	I don't think Tom is safe.
6666820	eng	I have a son your age.
6666821	eng	I told Tom he shouldn't eat anything that Mary cooked.
6666822	eng	I have a pickup truck.
6666823	eng	I don't care whether you help Tom or not.
6666824	eng	I have a lot of sheep.
6666825	eng	Tom called Mary from John's house.
6666826	eng	I have a half-brother.
6666827	eng	I don't think Tom is nuts.
6666828	eng	I have a good job now.
6666829	eng	I had to do that, too.
6666830	eng	I didn't want to stay as long as Tom did.
6666831	eng	I had a great weekend.
6666832	eng	Tom closed the shop early tonight.
6666833	eng	I got there in a taxi.
6666834	eng	I don't think Tom is next.
6666835	eng	I got out of the pool.
6666836	eng	I'm having a hard time getting Tom to do his homework.
6666837	eng	I got out of the bath.
6666838	eng	I didn't think Tom would get so homesick.
6666839	eng	I got on the elevator.
6666840	eng	Tom complains about his job a lot.
6666841	eng	I got home about 2:30.
6666842	eng	I don't think Tom is mean.
6666843	eng	I got here by bicycle.
6666844	eng	I'm not going to do everything Tom has asked me to do.
6666845	eng	I got caught speeding.
6666846	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so terrified.
6666847	eng	I got an F on my test.
6666848	eng	Tom decided to do that by himself.
6666849	eng	I got a perfect score.
6666850	eng	I don't think Tom is lost.
6666851	eng	I felt very confident.
6666852	eng	I'm the one who told Tom about what you did yesterday.
6666853	eng	I felt a little woozy.
6666854	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so talkative.
6666855	eng	I feel a little dazed.
6666856	eng	Tom didn't have an easy childhood.
6666857	eng	I don't want to argue.
6666858	eng	I don't think Tom is hurt.
6666859	eng	I don't often do this.
6666860	eng	Is that white car in front of my house Tom's or yours?
6666861	eng	I don't like shopping.
6666862	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so skeptical.
6666863	eng	I don't have red hair.
6666864	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to touch him.
6666865	eng	I don't have freckles.
6666866	eng	I don't think Tom is high.
6666867	eng	I don't have any cats.
6666868	eng	It doesn't really matter whether Tom does that or not.
6666869	eng	I don't do that a lot.
6666870	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so sarcastic.
6666871	eng	I don't carry a purse.
6666872	eng	Tom died fighting for his country.
6666873	eng	I almost won the race.
6666874	eng	I don't think Tom is free.
6666875	eng	I almost lost my mind.
6666876	eng	It seems Tom and I are the only ones here from Boston.
6666877	eng	I almost got it right.
6666878	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so reluctant.
6666879	eng	I agreed to come back.
6666880	eng	Tom doesn't want Mary to get hurt.
6666881	eng	I admitted doing that.
6666882	eng	I don't think Tom is cool.
6666883	eng	I admitted I did that.
6666884	eng	Let's ask Tom if he'd like to play volleyball with us.
6666885	eng	I admit I wasn't sure.
6666886	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so organized.
6666887	eng	How about next Monday?
6666888	eng	Tom drives a four-wheel drive van.
6666889	eng	Are these your gloves?
6666890	eng	I don't think Tom is back.
6666891	eng	Who drove here today?
6666892	eng	Since Tom and I were tired, we both went to bed early.
6666893	eng	This smells terrible.
6666894	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so obstinate.
6666895	eng	Let's go on a picnic.
6666896	eng	Tom encouraged me to go to Boston.
6666897	eng	I've had a rough day.
6666898	eng	I don't know why Tom left.
6666899	eng	I've agreed to leave.
6666900	eng	That happened three days after Tom got back to Boston.
6666901	eng	I'm going to be busy.
6666902	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so motivated.
6666903	eng	I'm going to a party.
6666904	eng	Tom found Mary crying in her room.
6666905	eng	I'll wait for a week.
6666906	eng	I discussed that with Tom.
6666907	eng	I'll try to be early.
6666908	eng	Tom always wears goggles when he rides his motorcycle.
6666909	eng	I'll go if I have to.
6666910	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so miserable.
6666911	eng	I'll gladly help you.
6666912	eng	Tom gave Mary a tour of his house.
6666913	eng	I'll be needing this.
6666914	eng	I can't seem to avoid Tom.
6666915	eng	I'll be married soon.
6666916	eng	Tom and I are just going to take it easy this weekend.
6666917	eng	I'll be leaving soon.
6666918	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so irritated.
6666919	eng	I'll be here tonight.
6666920	eng	Tom got an opportunity to do that.
6666921	eng	I'll be gone all day.
6666922	eng	I can't go to Tom's party.
6666923	eng	Tom and I are the only ones who don't want to be here.
6666924	eng	I'd almost forgotten.
6666925	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so intrigued.
6666926	eng	I often do that here.
6666927	eng	Tom got interested in art history.
6666928	eng	I often ask for help.
6666929	eng	I advised Tom to go there.
6666930	eng	I have no idea what to do.
6666931	eng	Tom and I are the only ones who survived the accident.
6666932	eng	I never do that here.
6666933	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so impatient.
6666934	eng	I have a step-sister.
6666935	eng	Tom got pretty good at doing that.
6666936	eng	I had a great summer.
6666937	eng	How good a swimmer is Tom?
6666938	eng	I got up before dawn.
6666939	eng	Tom and I aren't going to study together this evening.
6666940	eng	I got plenty of help.
6666941	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so easygoing.
6666942	eng	I got out of the cab.
6666943	eng	Tom got very depressed after that.
6666944	eng	I got in the bathtub.
6666945	eng	How good a drummer is Tom?
6666946	eng	I got bored and left.
6666947	eng	Tom and I weren't the only ones who needed to do that.
6666948	eng	I got back in my car.
6666949	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so desperate.
6666950	eng	I got another chance.
6666951	eng	Tom had a job interview on Monday.
6666952	eng	I got a little drunk.
6666953	eng	Does Tom have a snowboard?
6666954	eng	I felt very isolated.
6666955	eng	Tom and I weren't the only ones who wanted to do that.
6666956	eng	I felt a lot of pain.
6666957	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so depressed.
6666958	eng	I don't want to walk.
6666959	eng	Tom had a ladle in his right hand.
6666960	eng	I don't want to move.
6666961	eng	Could you please help Tom?
6666962	eng	I don't love my wife.
6666963	eng	Tom and Mary are having a dinner party Monday evening.
6666964	eng	I don't like popcorn.
6666965	eng	I didn't think Tom would be so dedicated.
6666966	eng	I don't like jogging.
6666967	eng	Tom had a rough time in Australia.

6673933	eng	Rocks take time to decompose, especially quartz and feldspar.
6673934	eng	Often starting thousands of miles from the ocean, rocks slowly travel down rivers and streams, constantly breaking down along the way. Once they make it to the ocean, they further erode from the constant action of waves and tides.
6673935	eng	Don't you think that's a little premature?
6673936	eng	The tan color of most sand beaches is the result of iron oxide, which tints quartz a light brown, and feldspar, which is brown to tan in its original form.
6673937	eng	Black sand comes from eroded volcanic material such as lava, basalt rocks, and other dark-colored rocks and minerals, and is typically found on beaches near volcanic activity.
6673938	eng	Black-sand beaches are common in Hawaii, the Canary Islands, and the Aleutians.
6673939	eng	The by-products of living things also play an important part in creating sandy beaches. Bermuda's preponderance of pleasantly pink beaches results from the perpetual decay of single-celled, shelled organisms called foraminifera.
6673940	eng	Mary raised her eyebrows.
6673941	eng	The famous white-sand beaches of Hawaii, for example, actually come from the poop of parrotfish. The fish bite and scrape algae off of rocks and dead corals with their parrot-like beaks, grind up the inedible calcium-carbonate reef material (made mostly of coral skeletons) in their guts, and then excrete it as sand.

6675691	eng	The Mississippi River carries millions of tons of nutrient-rich sediment into the Gulf each year.
6675693	eng	You're a quick study.
6675695	eng	Sixty-five percent of U.S. estuaries and coastal water bodies are moderately to severely degraded by excessive nutrient inputs, which lead to algal blooms and low-oxygen (hypoxic) waters that can kill fish and seagrass and reduce essential fish habitats.
6675698	eng	Eutrophication is a big word that describes a big problem in the nation's estuaries.
6675699	eng	The primary culprits in eutrophication appear to be excess nitrogen and phosphorus—from sources including fertilizer runoff and septic system effluent to atmospheric fallout from burning fossil fuels—which enter waterbodies and fuel the overgrowth of algae, which, in turn, reduces water quality and degrades estuarine and coastal ecosystems.
6675706	eng	The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth.

6675708	eng	The longest mountain range on Earth is called the mid-ocean ridge. Spanning 40,389 miles around the globe, it's truly a global landmark.
6675709	eng	About 90 percent of the mid-ocean ridge system is under the ocean.
6675711	eng	About 90 percent of the mid-ocean ridge system is under the ocean. This system of mountains and valleys criss-crosses the globe, resembling the stitches in a baseball. It's formed by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates.
6675713	eng	As the Earth's crust spreads, new ocean floor is created. This process literally renews the surface of our planet.
6675714	eng	If you look at a map of the world's volcanoes, you'll find that most of them form along the boundaries of this great system. In fact, the global mid-ocean ridge system forms the largest single volcanic feature on the Earth.
6675715	eng	The mid-ocean ridge consists of thousands of individual volcanoes or volcanic ridge segments which periodically erupt.
6675717	eng	What percentage of the American population lives near the coast?
6675718	eng	In 2010, 123.3 million people, or 39 percent of the United States’ population lived in counties directly on the shoreline.
6675720	eng	In the United States, counties directly on the shoreline constitute less than 10 percent of the total land area (not including Alaska), but account for 39 percent of the total population. From 1970 to 2010, the population of these counties increased by almost 40%.
6675721	eng	Coastal areas are substantially more crowded than the U.S. as a whole, and population density in coastal areas will continue to increase in the future.
6675722	eng	The population density of coastal shoreline couhe population density of coastal shoreline counties is over six times greater than the corresponding inland counties.
6675723	eng	The majority of marine protected areas in the United States are multiple-use sites, meaning fishing, boating, surfing, diving, and other recreational activities are allowed.

6675734	eng	The highest tides in the world can be found in Canada at the Bay of Fundy, which separates New Brunswick from Nova Scotia.
6675735	eng	At some times of the year the difference between high and low tide in the Bay of Fundy is 16.3 meters, taller than a three-story building.
6675736	eng	The highest tides in the United States can be found near Anchorage, Alaska, with tidal ranges up to 12.2 meters.
6675739	eng	Tidal highs and lows depend on a lot of different factors. The shape and geometry of a coastline play a major role, as do the locations of the Sun and Moon.
6675741	eng	Detailed forecasts are available for high and low tides in all sea ports, but are specific to local conditions.
6675742	eng	That many of the areas of the world with high ranges of tides are in the areas of Alaska, Canada, and northern Europe has created a misconception that the range of tide increases with increasing latitude (as one moves farther from the equator and closer to the poles). This is incorrect.
6675743	eng	In the higher latitudes of the northern hemisphere, the continents of North America, Europe, and Asia are pressed closer together. This “constriction” of the oceans creates the effect of a higher range of tides.
6675744	eng	The greatest number of the Earth's volcanoes occur on the ocean floor.
6675745	eng	Most volcanoes are found along a belt, called the “Ring of Fire” that encircles the Pacific Ocean.
6675746	eng	You're insulting my intelligence.
6675749	eng	Estuaries experience change many times a day due to tides.
6675752	eng	Sixty percent of all active volcanoes occur at the boundaries between tectonic plates.
6675753	eng	Located at the northern end of the Ten Thousand Islands on the gulf coast of Florida, the Rookery Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve represents one of the few remaining undisturbed mangrove estuaries in North America.
6675754	eng	Because of tides, the water levels in an estuary are going up and down several times a day.
6675755	eng	Estuarine organisms can adapt quite well to changing conditions in estuaries. For example, fish or crabs are mobile and can move as needed throughout the day to adjust to changes in the estuary.

6675770	eng	There are about 80 different species of mangrove trees.
6675773	eng	Mangrove forests only grow at tropical and subtropical latitudes near the equator because they cannot withstand freezing temperatures.
6675774	eng	Many mangrove forests can be recognized by their dense tangle of prop roots that make the trees appear to be standing on stilts above the water.
6675775	eng	This tangle of roots allows the trees to handle the daily rise and fall of tides, which means that most mangroves get flooded at least twice per day. The roots also slow the movement of tidal waters, causing sediments to settle out of the water and build up the muddy bottom.
6675779	eng	Mangrove forests stabilize the coastline, reducing erosion from storm surges, currents, waves, and tides.
6675781	eng	The intricate root system of mangroves makes these forests attractive to fish and other organisms seeking food and shelter from predators.

6684386	eng	Scientists are now using a genetic approach to estimate the ages of corals. The method determines when a coral egg and sperm originally met to form the genome of a coral colony. The researchers then track the number of mutations that have accumulated in the genome since that time. Because mutations tend to arise at a relatively constant rate, researchers can estimate the approximate age of the coral genomes in their study.

6684486	eng	Corals are sessile animals that "take root" on the ocean floor. It's no wonder that many people think corals are plants!
6684487	eng	Corals are sessile, which means that they permanently attach themselves to the ocean floor, essentially "taking root" like most plants do.
6684488	rus	Том сказал Мэри, чтобы она больше никогда так не делала.
6684489	eng	Corals are animals because they do not make their own food, as plants do. Corals have tiny, tentacle-like arms that they use to capture their food from the water and sweep into their inscrutable mouths.
6684490	ukr	Я їм не подобаюся.
6684491	eng	Most structures that we call "coral" are, in fact, made up of hundreds to thousands of tiny coral creatures called polyps. Each soft-bodied polyp—most no thicker than a nickel—secretes a hard outer skeleton of limestone (calcium carbonate) that attaches either to rock or the dead skeletons of other polyps.
6684492	rus	Кораллы - это животные или растения?
6684493	eng	In the case of stony or hard corals, these polyp conglomerates grow, die, and endlessly repeat the cycle over time, slowly laying the limestone foundation for coral reefs and giving shape to the familiar corals that reside there. Because of this cycle of growth, death, and regeneration among individual polyps, many coral colonies can live for a very long time.
6684494	eng	Most corals contain algae called zooxanthellae which are plant-like organisms.
6684495	eng	Residing within the coral's tissues, the microscopic algae are well protected and make use of the coral's metabolic waste products for photosynthesis, the process by which plants make their own food.
6684496	eng	The corals benefit, in turn, as the algae produce oxygen, remove wastes, and supply the organic products of photosynthesis that corals need to grow, thrive, and build up the reef.
6684497	eng	This mutual exchange is the reason why coral reefs are the largest structures of biological origin on Earth, and rival old-growth forests in the longevity of their ecological communities.

6684637	eng	Corals are a beautiful and important part of our ocean.
6684638	eng	Once a year, on cues from the lunar cycle and the water temperature, entire colonies of coral reefs simultaneously release their tiny eggs and sperm, called gametes, into the ocean.
6684639	eng	In ways that scientists still do not fully understand, mature corals release their gametes all at the same time. This synchrony is crucial, because the gametes of most coral species are viable for only a few hours. The “blizzard” makes it more likely that fertilization will occur.
6684640	eng	When a coral egg and sperm join together as an embryo, they develop into a coral larva, called a planula. Planulae float in the ocean, some for days and some for weeks, before dropping to the ocean floor. Then, depending on seafloor conditions, the planulae may attach to the substrate and grow into a new coral colony at the slow rate of about .4 inches a year.

6708759	eng	To date, we have explored less than five percent of the ocean.
6708760	eng	Much remains to be learned from exploring the mysteries of the deep.
6708761	eng	The ocean is the lifeblood of Earth, covering more than 70 percent of the planet's surface, driving weather, regulating temperature, and ultimately supporting all living organisms.
6708762	eng	Throughout history, the ocean has been a vital source of sustenance, transport, commerce, growth, and inspiration.
6708763	eng	Ninety-five percent of the world's oceans remain unexplored, unseen by human eyes.
6708764	eng	Salt marshes are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides.
6708765	eng	Pressure increases with ocean depth.
6708766	eng	Pisces V is a three-person submersible that can operate at depths up to 6,500 feet. This vehicle allows scientists to observe the deep sea under tremendous ocean pressure.
6708767	eng	At sea level, the air that surrounds us presses down on our bodies at 14.5 pounds per square inch. You don't feel it because the fluids in your body are pushing outward with the same force.
6708768	eng	The deeper you go under the sea, the greater the pressure of the water pushing down on you. For every 33 feet (10.06 meters) you go down, the pressure increases by 14.5 psi.
6708769	eng	Many animals that live in the sea have no trouble at all with high pressure.
6708770	eng	Whales can withstand dramatic pressure changes because their bodies are more flexible. Their ribs are bound by loose, bendable cartilage, which allows the rib cage to collapse at pressures that would easily snap our bones.
6708771	eng	A whale's lungs can also collapse safely under pressure, which keeps them from rupturing. This allows sperm whales to hunt for giant squid at depths of 7,000 feet or more.
6708772	eng	Why is the ocean salty, but rivers flowing into it are not?
6708773	eng	The water in the ocean collects all of the salt and minerals from all of the rivers that flow into it.
6708774	eng	Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated four billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually.
6708775	eng	An invasive species is an organism that causes ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native.
6708776	eng	Invasive species can harm both the natural resources in an ecosystem as well as threaten human use of these resources.
6708777	eng	An invasive species can be introduced to a new area via the ballast water of oceangoing ships, intentional and accidental releases of aquaculture species, aquarium specimens or bait, and other means.
6708778	eng	Invasive species are capable of causing extinctions of native plants and animals, reducing biodiversity, competing with native organisms for limited resources, and altering habitats. This can result in huge economic impacts and fundamental disruptions of coastal and Great Lakes ecosystems.
6708779	eng	Invasive species are animals or plants from another region of the world that don’t belong in their new environment.
6708780	eng	Invasive species can be introduced to an area by ship ballast water, accidental release, and most often, by people.
6708781	eng	Invasive species can lead to the extinction of native plants and animals, destroy biodiversity, and permanently alter habitats.

6710739	eng	I chose not to do that.
6710740	eng	Tom seemed a bit confused.
6710741	eng	I continued doing that.

6710744	eng	Tom was unable to do this.
6710745	eng	How did you manage this?

6710777	eng	I'm having a senior moment.
6710778	eng	I asked Tom when he did that.
6710779	eng	That's still up in the air.
6710780	eng	Is that really what Tom said?
6710781	eng	You can do that if you try.

6710797	eng	I can now do that by myself.
6710798	eng	I've convinced Tom to do that.
6710799	eng	I have a blister on my foot.

6710808	eng	I asked Tom to do that quickly.
6710809	eng	Can you stay a little longer?

6710811	eng	I apparently have to do that.
6710812	eng	I asked Tom to stop doing that.
6710813	eng	I apparently need to do that.
6710814	eng	I asked Tom why he'd done that.
6710815	eng	I barely had time to do that.
6710816	eng	I assured Tom that I'd do that.
6710817	eng	I could force you to do that.
6710818	eng	Tom tried to do that yesterday.
6710819	eng	I need someone to go with me.
6710820	eng	Tom tried to get Mary to leave.
6710821	eng	I only do that in the summer.

6710823	eng	I think you misunderstood me.
6710824	eng	Tom was unable to speak French.
6710825	eng	I wonder what we ought to do.

6710827	eng	It's not worth talking about.
6710828	eng	I asked Tom if I could kiss him.
6710829	eng	Let's go get a cup of coffee.
6710830	eng	I asked Tom if he could do that.
6710831	eng	How can you be so insensitive?
6710832	eng	I asked Tom not to do that here.
6710833	eng	How hard can it be to do that?
6710834	eng	I asked Tom what the matter was.

6710836	eng	I can help Tom do that, I think.
6710837	eng	I asked Tom why he had to do that.
6710838	eng	Tom tried to do the right thing.
6710839	eng	I began doing that last month.

6710843	eng	I tried to do the right thing.

6710854	eng	I asked if I needed to do that.
6710855	eng	Tom thinks of no one but himself.
6710856	eng	I can do that for you, I think.
6710857	eng	Tom was a close friend of Mary's.
6710858	eng	I could be fired if I did that.
6710859	eng	I asked Tom a couple of questions.

6710865	eng	I begged Tom to do that carefully.
6710866	eng	I'm not the best person to ask.
6710867	eng	I think I forgot to tell Tom that.
6710868	eng	That's not what I meant at all.
6710869	eng	Tom has the best job in the world.
6710870	eng	This is something I believe in.
