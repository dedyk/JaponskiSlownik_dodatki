4013236	eng	Tom and Mary are going to get married next spring.
4013237	eng	Are you sure this is the right spot?
4013238	eng	This seems like a good spot.
4013239	eng	I know that Tom doesn't like spinach.
4013240	eng	Are you still afraid of spiders?
4013241	eng	That was a just figure of speech.
4013242	eng	That was a figure of speech.
4013243	eng	Could you be a little more specific?
4013244	eng	What languages do you know how to speak?
4013245	eng	Tom cleared his throat and began to speak.
4013246	eng	There isn't a moment to spare.
4013247	eng	Could you pass the spaghetti?
4013248	eng	Are you sure there's no meat in this soup?
4013249	eng	It's not as crazy as it sounds.
4013250	eng	It's not quite as bad as it sounds.
4013251	eng	Tom thinks he needs to lose some weight, but Mary doesn't think so.
4013252	eng	Is it too late to say I'm sorry?
4013253	eng	This should be over very soon.
4013254	eng	We've got to do something about this problem soon.
4013255	eng	My shift's over soon.
4013256	eng	This might be over soon.
4013257	eng	This will all be over soon.
4013258	eng	It's going to be morning soon.
4013259	eng	Tom should be back here soon.
4013260	eng	Why didn't you call me sooner?
4013261	eng	Why didn't you come to see me sooner?
4013262	eng	What's the name of your son?
4013263	eng	What did you name your son?
4013264	eng	Can you teach me how to play that song?
4013265	eng	Did you hide it somewhere?
4013266	eng	Would you like to try some?
4013267	eng	Perhaps we could get a drink sometime.
4013268	eng	Would you like to have dinner sometime?
4013269	eng	Let me cook you dinner sometime.
4013270	eng	Before you leave, can I ask you something?
4013271	eng	Can I get your advice on something?
4013272	eng	It looks as though Tom is waiting for something.
4013273	eng	It's obvious Tom is waiting for someone.
4013274	eng	It looks as though Tom is waiting for somebody.
4013275	eng	Could you get me a club soda?
4013276	eng	Aren't you too young to smoke?
4013277	eng	What's that disgusting smell?
4013278	eng	Tom slid down the slide.
4013279	eng	When was the last time you had a good night's sleep?
4013280	eng	Why didn't you tell me Tom was sleeping?
4013281	eng	Tom smothered Mary to death with a pillow while she was sleeping.
4013282	eng	It takes time to master any skill.
4013283	eng	Have you ever gone skiing?
4013284	eng	Have you ever tried skateboarding?
4013285	eng	Do you think Tom can handle the situation?
4013286	eng	Does Tom understand the situation?
4013287	eng	How well do you sing?
4013288	eng	What kind of songs does Tom sing?
4013289	eng	It's really very simple.
4013290	eng	It wasn't really that simple.
4013291	eng	It wasn't quite that simple.
4013292	eng	It can't be that simple.
4013293	eng	Sometimes it's not so simple.
4013294	eng	It's really quite simple.
4013295	eng	It's all really quite simple.
4013296	eng	Actually, it was quite simple.
4013297	eng	That's quite simple.
4013298	eng	It's really all quite simple.
4013299	eng	This was supposed to be simple.
4013300	eng	Tom sat on the window sill.
4013301	eng	There was an eerie silence.
4013302	eng	There was absolute silence.
4013303	eng	It's actually a good sign.
4013304	eng	Maybe that's a good sign.
4013305	eng	Tom isn't really sick.
4013306	eng	Who else is going to be on the show?
4013307	eng	Was that you I heard singing in the shower?
4013308	eng	Tom didn't take a shower.
4013309	eng	Why is everybody shouting?
4013310	eng	Tom doesn't study as hard as he should.
4013311	eng	Tom carried his duffel bag on his shoulder.
4013312	eng	That was just a warning shot.
4013313	eng	When was the last time you had a tetanus shot?
4013314	eng	Do you think Mary's skirt is too short?
4013315	eng	Tom has been arrested for shoplifting.
4013316	eng	Where did you learn to shoot?
4013317	eng	I love those shoes.
4013318	eng	Tom has more than thirty pairs of shoes.
4013319	eng	The police found Tom's blood on Mary's shoes.
4013320	eng	Tom looked down at his dirty shoes.
4013321	eng	Where did you get that shirt?
4013322	eng	Tom was wearing a red shirt.
4013323	eng	Tom is the boy wearing the blue shirt.
4013324	eng	Tom is staying in a homeless shelter.
4013325	eng	It's on the bottom shelf.
4013326	eng	Tom and his workers killed all the infected sheep.
4013327	eng	Is there anything you'd like to share?
4013328	eng	Tom is trying to get back in shape.
4013329	eng	Should we call room service?
4013330	eng	Maybe I can be of service.
4013331	eng	What purpose does this serve?
4013332	eng	What purpose would that serve?
4013333	eng	Are you two getting serious?
4013334	eng	Tom has been sentenced to three consecutive life sentences.
4013335	eng	That doesn't make a lot of sense.
4013336	eng	It doesn't make a lot of sense.
4013337	eng	That doesn't make much sense.
4013338	eng	It doesn't make much sense.
4013339	eng	It's all starting to make sense.
4013340	eng	It's all beginning to make sense.
4013341	eng	It does kind of make sense.
4013342	eng	Tom lacks common sense.
4013343	eng	That just doesn't make any sense.
4013344	eng	Tom decided to buy the car Mary was trying to sell.
4013345	eng	What was the last play you went to see?
4013346	eng	What was the last movie you went to see?
4013347	eng	Who are you here to see?
4013348	eng	There's not much to see.
4013349	eng	There's a lot more to see.
4013350	eng	Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
4013351	eng	How did you get past security?
4013352	eng	Perhaps we should call security.
4013354	eng	It was all over in a matter of seconds.
4013355	eng	Would you excuse me for just one second?
4013356	eng	Would you excuse me for one second?
4013357	eng	Would you excuse us just a second?
4013358	eng	Could you hold on for just a second?
4013359	eng	Could you excuse us a second?
4013360	eng	Could you excuse us for a second?
4013361	eng	Could you hold this for a second?
4013362	eng	Can I talk to you in private for a second?
4013363	eng	Could you hold these for a second?
4013364	eng	Could you come up here for a second?
4013365	eng	Would you excuse me for a second?
4013366	eng	Will you please excuse me for a second?
4013367	eng	Could you hold on a second?
4013368	eng	Would you excuse me a second?
4013369	eng	Let me think for just a second.
4013370	eng	Let me think for a second.
4013371	eng	Please excuse me for a second.
4013372	eng	All right, hold on a second.
4013373	eng	This will only take a second.
4013374	eng	It'll only take a second.
4013375	eng	This should only take a second.
4013376	eng	Could you excuse us a sec?
4013377	eng	Could you hold this for a sec?
4013378	eng	Would you excuse me for a sec?
4013379	eng	Would you like to trade seats?
4013380	eng	Would you please get out of my seat?
4013381	eng	There's a blanket in the back seat.
4013382	eng	Would you please have a seat?
4013383	eng	Could you please take a seat?
4013384	eng	How is the fishing going this season?
4013385	eng	Why do you need a screwdriver?
4013386	eng	I think I just heard somebody scream.
4013387	eng	Let me show you my scrapbook.
4013388	eng	Tell me about your school.
4013389	eng	Do you know where Tom went to school?
4013390	eng	Where do your children go to school?
4013391	eng	Tom sometimes walks to school.
4013392	eng	Tom pretended he was sick so he wouldn't have to go to school.
4013393	eng	Didn't you go to my high school?
4013394	eng	Did you get good grades in junior high school?
4013395	eng	Were you two friends in high school?
4013396	eng	Did you study hard in high school?

4013398	eng	Tom lived three miles away from Mary when they were both in high school.
4013399	eng	Tom and Mary became friends when they were in high school.
4013400	eng	It's been three years since Tom graduated from high school.
4013401	eng	Tom was Mary's boyfriend all through high school.
4013402	eng	What this place needs is a good school.
4013403	eng	Both Tom and Mary were absent from school.
4013404	eng	I met Tom on my way home from school.
4013405	eng	Go get ready for school.
4013406	eng	I've known Tom since elementary school.
4013407	eng	Were you really home schooled?
4013408	eng	Aren't you supposed to be at school?
4013409	eng	Are we still going to go over to Tom's after school?
4013410	eng	Tom plays football every day after school.
4013411	eng	Tom often plays tennis after school.
4013412	eng	Tom invited me to his house after school.
4013413	eng	Tom used to help his father in the store after school.
4013414	eng	What's next on your schedule?
4013415	eng	Were you on a tight schedule?
4013416	eng	You seem to be on a very tight schedule.
4013417	eng	What's next on the schedule?
4013418	eng	Let me check the schedule.
4013419	eng	Tom admitted he was scared.
4013420	eng	What makes you think I'm scared?
4013421	eng	There's no reason to be scared.
4013422	eng	Is there anything else you want to say?
4013423	eng	Is there anything left to say?
4013424	eng	What are you actually trying to say?
4013425	eng	What exactly are you going to say?
4013426	eng	Well, don't you have anything to say?
4013427	eng	What more is there to say?
4013428	eng	What's it you expect me to say?
4013429	eng	Is there anything you'd like to say?
4013430	eng	Well, what was I supposed to say?
4013431	eng	There isn't much left to say.
4013432	eng	There isn't much to say.
4013433	eng	It just seemed like the right thing to say.
4013434	eng	That was the wrong thing to say.
4013435	eng	That was a terrible thing to say.
4013436	eng	That's a terrible thing to say.
4013437	eng	That's not a very nice thing to say.
4013438	eng	That's not a nice thing to say.
4013439	eng	There's not much else to say.
4013440	eng	What does the sign say?
4013441	eng	What do you think I should say?
4013442	eng	That's what everyone says.
4013443	eng	Did you hear what they were saying?
4013444	eng	I couldn't hear what they were saying.
4013445	eng	Can you hear what Tom is saying?

4013455	eng	Did you think I was being sarcastic?
4013456	eng	Can I have another sandwich?
4013457	eng	It looks exactly the same.
4013458	eng	Everything looks exactly the same.
4013459	eng	It's not quite the same.
4013460	eng	It won't be quite the same.
4013461	eng	Tom receives a very high salary.
4013462	eng	What kind of dressing do you want on your salad?
4013463	eng	What do you like on your salad?
4013464	eng	What was the last thing Tom said?
4013465	eng	Did you hear what Tom just said?
4013466	eng	Didn't you hear what I just said?
4013467	eng	Do you understand what I just said?
4013468	eng	Have you thought about what I said?
4013469	eng	Tom probably didn't really mean what he said.
4013470	eng	Could you hear what was being said?
4013471	eng	Did you hear what was being said?
4013472	eng	I couldn't hear what was being said.
4013473	eng	There's no place to run.
4013474	eng	I think I left the water running.
4013475	eng	Why's the engine still running?
4013476	eng	Why is everybody running?
4013477	eng	It's probably just a rumor.
4013478	eng	Let's go to your room.
4013479	eng	Go back to the waiting room.
4013480	eng	Are you sure this is Tom's room?
4013481	eng	Do you have the key to this room?
4013482	eng	Was there anybody else in the room?
4013483	eng	Was there anything else in the room?
4013484	eng	Could you please leave the room?
4013485	eng	Tom pushed the door open and stepped into the room.
4013486	eng	Tom was the only other person in the room.
4013487	eng	I saw Tom leave the room.
4013488	eng	Are you sure this is the right room?
4013489	eng	Do you have any idea who's in the next room?
4013490	eng	Let me see what's going on in the next room.
4013491	eng	Tom and Mary are in the next room.
4013492	eng	What are you doing in my room?
4013493	eng	Do you really need a roommate?
4013494	eng	The police found Tom's footprint in Mary's room.
4013495	eng	Tom has a lot of books in his room.
4013496	eng	Go and see if Tom is in his room.
4013497	eng	Tom is now studying in his room.
4013498	eng	Tom has just finished cleaning his room.
4013499	eng	Tom rushed out of his room.
4013500	eng	Tom needs to organize his room.
4013501	eng	Do you have an extra room?
4013502	eng	There's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof.
4013503	eng	It's about three kilometers up the road.
4013504	eng	Tom isn't used to driving on the left side of the road.
4013505	eng	Tom managed to swim across the river.
4013506	eng	Tom's house is on the other side of the river.
4013507	eng	Is it really worth the risk?
4013508	eng	Why should I take the risk?
4013509	eng	It won't be worth the risk.
4013510	eng	It was a calculated risk.
4013511	eng	Does Tom wear a wedding ring?
4013512	eng	What do you think of Tom's nose ring?
4013513	eng	Are you saying Tom was right?
4013514	eng	Are you saying I was right?
4013515	eng	Tom knew that Mary was right.
4013516	eng	Tom insisted that he was right.
4013517	eng	We're going to Tom's birthday party tomorrow, right?
4013518	eng	You aren't leaving until tomorrow, right?
4013519	eng	You did talk to Tom, right?
4013520	eng	You live with your parents, right?
4013521	eng	Are you sure this is right?
4013522	eng	It's really pretty easy, right?
4013523	eng	You do know what you're doing, right?
4013524	eng	It can't be that bad, right?
4013525	eng	Are you sure everything's all right?
4013526	eng	Are you children all right?
4013527	eng	Are you sure you're feeling all right?
4013528	eng	Are you sure you're going to be all right?
4013529	eng	Are you sure you'll be all right?
4013530	eng	Let me handle this, all right?
4013531	eng	This place is all right.
4013532	eng	I'll stay with Tom until you return.
4013533	eng	Do you ever think about retiring?
4013534	eng	Who said anything about retiring?
4013535	eng	What have you been doing since you retired?
4013536	eng	Perhaps I should let you rest.
4013537	eng	Maybe I should let you rest.
4013538	eng	Would you please get some rest?
4013539	eng	Go home and get some rest.
4013540	eng	Go home and get a good night's rest.
4013541	eng	What was the name of that restaurant?
4013542	eng	Are you asking me to resign?
4013543	eng	Tom decided to cancel the reservations.
4013544	eng	What information do you require?
4013545	eng	Is there anything else you require?
4013546	eng	Are you refusing my request?
4013547	eng	What information are you requesting?
4013548	eng	Did you have time to look over the report?
4013549	eng	Do you have a copy of that report?
4013550	eng	Tom has already turned in his report.
4013551	eng	Tom has just finished writing his report.
4013552	eng	Tom has just finished his report.
4013553	eng	It really is a good replica.
4013554	eng	It'll take three hours to finish these repairs.
4013555	eng	Tom didn't have enough money to pay the rent.
4013556	eng	I lent Tom some money so he could pay this month's rent.
4013557	eng	Thanks for the reminder.
4013558	eng	What's the last thing that you remember?
4013559	eng	Is there anything else you remember?
4013560	eng	It's nice to be remembered.
4013561	eng	Are you sure this information is reliable?
4013562	eng	Would you just try to relax?
4013563	eng	It's not really that relaxing.
4013564	eng	That's a tough offer to refuse.
4013565	eng	How could I possibly refuse?
4013566	eng	Tom made Mary an offer she couldn't refuse.
4013567	eng	Tom demanded a refund.
4013568	eng	Shouldn't this be in the refrigerator?
4013569	eng	What's wrong with the refrigerator?
4013570	eng	That's refreshing.
4013571	eng	What would you recommend?
4013572	eng	It's barely recognizable.
4013573	eng	Tom has put on a lot of weight recently.
4013574	eng	Tom has lost quite a lot of weight recently.
4013575	eng	What happened to Tom? I haven't seen him recently.
4013576	eng	Have you been out of the country recently?
4013577	eng	Have you hugged anyone recently?
4013578	eng	What could possibly be the reason?
4013579	eng	What was the second reason?
4013580	eng	That's not the real reason.
4013581	eng	Is that the only reason?
4013582	eng	That's not the only reason.
4013583	eng	It's very simple, really.
4013584	eng	It's all pretty simple really.
4013585	eng	Let me know as soon as you're ready.
4013586	eng	What was the last book you read?
4013587	eng	Are the muffins ready?
4013588	eng	Let me know when it's ready.
4013589	eng	How soon can you have it ready?
4013590	eng	Let me see if Tom is ready.
4013591	eng	It'll take time to get everything ready.
4013592	eng	How soon can you be ready?
4013593	eng	How soon will you be ready?
4013594	eng	What time should we be ready?
4013595	eng	Are you all packed and ready?
4013596	eng	Tom spends a lot of time reading.
4013597	eng	How long have you had that rash?
4013598	eng	Where were you when the doorbell rang?
4013599	eng	It's already started to rain.
4013600	eng	It's already started raining.
4013601	eng	Do you have a raincoat?
4013602	eng	Do you want to listen to the radio?
4013603	eng	Could you turn on the radio?
4013604	eng	Could you turn off the radio?
4013605	eng	Who said anything about quitting?
4013606	eng	Are you usually this quiet?
4013607	eng	Are you normally this quiet?
4013608	eng	Are you always this quiet?
4013609	eng	Tom closed the door quietly.
4013610	eng	Would the two of you please be quiet?
4013611	eng	The teacher told Tom to be quiet.
4013612	eng	How did you finish so quickly?
4013613	eng	Come on, just answer the question.
4013614	eng	I probably shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
4013615	eng	Tom has answered all of the questions.
4013616	eng	Tom asked the teacher some questions.
4013617	eng	Tom asked me a lot of questions.
4013618	eng	Why won't anybody answer my questions?
4013619	eng	Tom won't answer any of my questions.
4013620	eng	Tom couldn't answer any of my questions.
4013621	eng	Would you mind if we asked you a few questions?
4013622	eng	Would you mind if I asked you a few questions?
4013623	eng	Can I just ask a few questions?
4013624	eng	Let me ask you a few questions.
4013625	eng	I bet you've got a few questions.
4013626	eng	Could I just ask you one question?
4013627	eng	Just answer my question.
4013628	eng	Tom couldn't answer my question.
4013629	eng	Tom couldn't answer the last question.
4013630	eng	Was that a dumb question?
4013631	eng	Let me ask you another question.
4013632	eng	I think Tom broke the dish on purpose.
4013633	eng	The book Tom wrote was never published.
4013634	eng	I've never heard Tom sing in public.
4013635	eng	What's Tom trying to prove?
4013636	eng	What more do you have to prove?
4013637	eng	What exactly are you proposing?
4013638	eng	Does Tom own any other property?
4013639	eng	Please get off my property.
4013640	eng	Tom knew that Mary wanted him to ask her to the prom.
4013641	eng	Did you go to your high school prom?
4013642	eng	Tom helped Mary with her science project.
4013643	eng	Have you made any more progress?
4013644	eng	So what's the prognosis?
4013645	eng	It's an extremely complicated process.
4013646	eng	What do you think's causing this problem?
4013647	eng	Do you have any idea what's causing the problem?
4013648	eng	What do you think's causing the problem?
4013649	eng	What do you think caused the problem?
4013650	eng	I think Tom will be able to solve the problem.
4013651	eng	Tom will be able to solve the problem.
4013652	eng	Could I talk to you in private?
4013653	eng	May I speak with you in private?
4013654	eng	May I have a word with you in private?
4013655	eng	Could I have a word with you in private?
4013656	eng	May I speak to you for a moment in private?
4013657	eng	Is there someplace we could speak in private?
4013658	eng	Tom and Mary value their privacy.
4013659	eng	Could we please have a little privacy?
4013660	eng	How long were you in prison?
4013661	eng	Have you ever been in prison?
4013662	eng	Go get the rest of the prisoners.
4013663	eng	Where are the other prisoners?
4013664	eng	It's not a high priority.
4013665	eng	Tom complained about the high prices.
4013666	eng	It's actually kind of pretty.
4013667	eng	Aren't you being a little presumptuous?
4013668	eng	Tom wanted to run for class president.
4013669	eng	Tom was the only other person present.
4013670	eng	Tom borrowed thirty dollars from Mary to buy John a birthday present.
4013671	eng	It's always better to be prepared.
4013672	eng	It was a wise precaution.
4013673	eng	Could you please pass the potatoes?
4013674	eng	It's theoretically possible.
4013675	eng	It's not physically possible.
4013676	eng	Maybe it's not possible.
4013677	eng	Do you really think it's possible?
4013678	eng	How is that even possible?
4013679	eng	Maybe it's not even possible.
4013680	eng	Do you really think it'll be possible?
4013681	eng	That might not be possible.
4013682	eng	That shouldn't be possible.
4013683	eng	Please do it as soon as possible.
4013684	eng	Please get your report to me as soon as possible.
4013685	eng	Keep as still as possible.
4013686	eng	I'd like to stay here for as long as possible.
4013687	eng	I'd like to stay here as long as possible.
4013688	eng	That's a real possibility.
4013689	eng	Is this beef or pork?
4013690	eng	Please get off my porch.
4013691	eng	Who pushed you into the pool?
4013692	eng	There's no water in the pool.
4013693	eng	Where's the swimming pool?
4013694	eng	Shouldn't you call the police?
4013695	eng	Why not just call the police?
4013696	eng	Whose idea was it to call the police?
4013697	eng	Are you going to call the police?
4013698	eng	Have you called the police?
4013699	eng	I think that's rat poison.
4013700	eng	Are you sure this isn't poison?
4013701	eng	It's probably just food poisoning.
4013702	eng	Have you checked your pockets?
4013703	eng	Do I look like a plumber?
4013704	eng	What an unexpected pleasure!
4013705	eng	Could I have a glass of water, please?
4013706	eng	Would you get me a glass of water, please?
4013707	eng	Could you get me a glass of water, please?
4013708	eng	Could I have some more water, please?
4013709	eng	Could you get me a glass of ice water please.
4013710	eng	Will you excuse us, please?
4013711	eng	Would you excuse us, please?
4013712	eng	Could you excuse us, please?
4013713	eng	Would you stand up, please?
4013714	eng	Could you stand up, please?
4013715	eng	Could you just stand up, please?
4013716	eng	Hello. May I speak to Tom, please?
4013717	eng	Could you give us a little time, please?
4013718	eng	Would you mind repeating that, please?
4013719	eng	Could you hold that, please?
4013720	eng	Would you be quiet, please?
4013721	eng	Would you both be quiet, please?
4013722	eng	Could I have a napkin, please?
4013723	eng	Could I have your name, please?
4013724	eng	Would you pardon me one moment, please?
4013725	eng	Could I speak to you for a moment, please?
4013726	eng	Would you two give us a minute, please?
4013727	eng	Would you excuse us for a minute, please?
4013728	eng	Would you excuse me for a minute, please?
4013729	eng	Could you sharpen this knife for me, please?
4013730	eng	Would you excuse me, please?
4013731	eng	Could you excuse me, please?
4013732	eng	Would you leave, please?
4013733	eng	Could you describe it, please?
4013734	eng	Could you come out here, please?
4013735	eng	Could you just sign right here, please?
4013736	eng	Would you come over here, please?
4013737	eng	Could I have some help, please?
4013738	eng	Could you do me a little favor, please?
4013739	eng	Go a little faster, please?
4013740	eng	Could you close the door, please?
4013741	eng	Would you let us by, please?
4013742	eng	Could you send someone up for my bags, please?
4013743	eng	Could I have everyone's attention, please?
4013744	eng	Could you check that again, please?
4013745	eng	How did you enjoy the play?
4013746	eng	What was the name of that tune you were playing?
4013747	eng	Tom wants to be a baseball player.
4013748	eng	Was that part of your plan?
4013749	eng	Why didn't you change the plan?
4013750	eng	Why did you change the plan?
4013751	tur	Bunu onlara verebilir misin?
4013752	eng	All right, here's the plan.
4013753	eng	That's not part of the plan.
4013754	eng	That wasn't part of the plan.
4013755	eng	This is a really terrible plan.
4013756	eng	There's been change of plan.
4013757	eng	The event was very well planned.
4013758	eng	Everything went exactly as planned.
4013759	eng	What do you think of my plan?
4013760	eng	That wasn't exactly my plan.
4013761	eng	There's been a change in plan.
4013762	eng	It wasn't really a very good plan.
4013763	eng	It seems like a very good plan.
4013764	eng	It seemed like such a good plan.
4013765	eng	It seems like a good plan.
4013766	eng	That sounds like a good plan.
4013767	eng	It seemed like a good plan.
4013768	eng	It does seem like an excellent plan.
4013769	eng	Have you come up with another plan?
4013770	eng	It wasn't really a plan.
4013771	eng	Now what we need is a plan.
4013772	eng	Now all we need is a plan.
4013773	eng	It's not much of a plan.
4013774	eng	We need to make a plan.
4013775	eng	How did you find out about this place?
4013776	eng	Who else knows about this place?
4013777	eng	Who's running this place?
4013778	eng	Did you have any trouble finding this place?
4013779	eng	What's the name of this place?
4013780	eng	It's time for us to leave this place.
4013781	eng	It's time to leave this place.
4013782	eng	Are you sure this is the place?
4013783	eng	What's the name of the place?
4013784	eng	Who was in second place?
4013785	eng	Keep your money in a safe place.
4013786	eng	This is a good hiding place.
4013787	eng	Tom knew that Mary wouldn't want to eat at a fast food place.
4013788	eng	This is a fantastic place.
4013789	eng	Do you want to get a pizza?
4013790	eng	How long does it take to deliver a pizza?
4013791	eng	Tom called me a pig.
4013792	eng	Could I get another piece of pie?
4013793	eng	It looks like a perfect day for a picnic.
4013794	eng	Does it really matter which one of these I pick?
4013795	eng	I could hear Tom playing the piano.
4013796	eng	Well, aren't you going to answer your phone?
4013797	eng	What's wrong with your phone?
4013798	eng	Was that Tom on the phone?
4013799	eng	Is Tom still on the phone?
4013800	eng	Please get Tom Jackson on the phone.
4013801	eng	I've always wanted a pet.
4013802	eng	Do you recognize that person?
4013803	eng	Are you a superstitious person?
4013804	eng	Are we talking about the same person?
4013805	eng	Are you sure we're talking about the same person?
4013807	eng	Tom is an outgoing person.
4013808	eng	Do you consider yourself to be a lucky person?
4013809	eng	Have you ever met a famous person?
4013810	eng	That was pretty much perfect.
4013811	eng	Tom told Mary that everything would be perfect.
4013812	eng	What's the matter with you people?
4013813	eng	Do you know anything about those people?
4013814	eng	Tom lost his favorite pen.
4013815	eng	Excuse me, do you have a pen?
4013816	eng	Who's this other patient?
4013817	eng	I have no idea where Tom keeps his passport.
4013818	tur	Bunu bana verebilir misin?
4013819	eng	Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
4013820	eng	Do you have any idea how many people are coming to tonight's party?
4013821	eng	Can't you just be happy and enjoy the party?
4013822	eng	Did you know anyone at the party?
4013823	eng	Who else is going to be at the party?
4013824	eng	Are we too late for the party?
4013825	eng	Are you going back to the party?
4013826	eng	Are you going to the party?
4013827	eng	Are you going to wear a costume to the party?
4013828	eng	Tom didn't show up at the party.
4013829	eng	Enjoy yourself at the party.
4013830	eng	Tom gave Mary a ride home after the party.
4013831	eng	Everyone except Tom went to the party.
4013832	eng	Tom wished he hadn't gone to the party.
4013833	eng	Tom looks like he's enjoying the party.
4013834	eng	Tom appears to be enjoying the party.
4013835	eng	This is a private party.
4013836	eng	How about inviting Tom to our party?
4013837	eng	Would it be OK if I didn't invite Tom to my party?
4013838	eng	I didn't think Tom would show up at Mary's party.
4013839	eng	Tom baked three dozen cookies for Mary's party.
4013840	eng	Tom didn't invite Mary to his party.
4013841	eng	Tom was afraid that no one would come to his party.
4013842	eng	Tom told Mary why he couldn't go to her party.
4013843	eng	It's going to be a great party.
4013844	eng	Have you ever been to a costume party?
4013845	eng	I doubt if Tom will come to my birthday party.
4013846	eng	Tom wants you to come to his birthday party.
4013847	eng	Tom will be going to Mary's birthday party.
4013848	eng	How was the bachelor party?
4013849	eng	Tom auditioned for the part.
4013850	eng	When did you write that last part?
4013851	eng	The Jacksons love to have parties.
4013852	eng	Did you really see Tom in the park?
4013853	eng	Did you see anybody else in the park?
4013854	eng	Tom is waiting for us in the park.
4013855	eng	Go take a walk in the park.
4013856	eng	When was the last time you went to an amusement park?
4013857	eng	Do you think you're smarter than your parents?
4013858	eng	Do you still live with your parents?
4013859	eng	How tall are your parents?
4013860	eng	Tom seldom writes to his parents.
4013861	eng	Aren't you being a little paranoid?
4013862	eng	Now you're being paranoid.
4013863	eng	Did you finish your paper?
4013864	eng	Do you still have yesterday's paper?
4013865	eng	Do you have any wrapping paper?
4013866	eng	There's no reason for panic.
4013867	eng	Did the doctor give you anything for the pain?
4013868	eng	How long have you had the pain?
4013869	eng	This should relieve the pain.
4013870	eng	The Jacksons had their house painted.
4013871	eng	Do you think you're the only one in pain?
4013872	eng	It's obviously very painful.
4013873	eng	Do you think that plants feel pain?
4013874	eng	Do you expect me to believe you did this on your own?
4013875	eng	Can't you do anything on your own?
4013876	eng	Are you sure you can manage on your own?
4013877	eng	Would you rather be on your own?
4013878	eng	Do you want me to take over?
4013879	eng	Perhaps I should take over.
4013880	eng	Let me know when it's over.
4013881	eng	Do you need time to think it over?
4013882	eng	Tom asked me to think it over.
4013883	eng	This meeting isn't over.
4013884	eng	I'll be glad when this is over.
4013885	eng	Tom's autopsy revealed that he died from an overdose.
4013886	eng	Are you sure it's all over?
4013887	eng	It's not going to work out.
4013888	eng	Do you think anyone was here while we were out?
4013889	eng	Is that the only way out?
4013890	eng	That door's the only way out.
4013891	eng	There's no other way out.
4013892	eng	There seems to be no way out.
4013893	eng	This should be thrown out.
4013894	eng	How did you figure all this out?
4013895	eng	Would you mind waiting outside?
4013896	eng	There are a lot of people waiting outside.
4013897	eng	There's a cab waiting outside.
4013898	eng	Can you wait outside?
4013899	eng	Would you rather wait outside?
4013900	eng	Take that stuff outside.
4013901	eng	Can I see you a second outside?
4013902	eng	What's the weather like outside?
4013903	eng	Tom got a note from Mary asking him to meet her outside.
4013904	eng	What are the police doing outside?
4013905	eng	Who locked the dog outside?
4013906	eng	Has the fire been put out?
4013907	eng	Maybe you can help me out.
4013908	eng	Why are all the lights out?
4013909	eng	We still have some details to iron out.
4013910	eng	There are some details to iron out.
4013911	eng	Tom knew that Mary wanted him to ask her out.
4013912	eng	Tom stopped the car and got out.
4013913	eng	This fire has just gone out.
4013914	eng	How long have you been going out?
4013915	eng	How long have you two been going out?
4013916	eng	Why did the lights go out?
4013917	eng	Are you trying to get out?
4013918	eng	Well, what did you find out?
4013919	eng	How are they going to find out?
4013920	eng	How is Tom going to find out?
4013921	eng	Do you want me to see what I can find out?
4013922	eng	Well, let's go find out.
4013923	eng	See what you can find out.
4013924	eng	Let me see what I can find out.
4013925	eng	What are you trying to figure out?
4013926	eng	What time are you checking out?
4013927	eng	How do you think the fire broke out?
4013928	eng	It's too late for us to back out.
4013929	eng	How did you figure this all out?
4013930	eng	How will we protect ourselves?
4013931	eng	Do you two already know each other?
4013932	eng	Don't you know each other?
4013933	eng	How did you get to know each other?
4013934	eng	When did Tom and Mary start going out with each other?
4013935	eng	When will we see each other?
4013936	eng	Tom and Mary apologized to each other.
4013937	eng	Tom and Mary are related to each other.
4013938	eng	Tom saw Mary and John flirting with each other.
4013939	eng	This might be the last time we ever see each other.
4013940	eng	Tom and Mary understand each other.
4013941	eng	Tom and Mary need each other.
4013942	eng	Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
4013943	eng	Everything is in perfect working order.
4013944	eng	Have you already decided what you're going to order?
4013945	eng	Do you always obey orders?
4013946	eng	There are only three options.
4013947	eng	We only have three options.
4013948	eng	There are three options.
4013949	eng	Are there any other options?
4013950	eng	There are a couple of options.
4013951	eng	There are always options.
4013952	eng	There's no better option.
4013953	eng	Thanks again for the opportunity.
4013954	eng	This is your last opportunity.
4013955	eng	It seemed like a good opportunity.
4013956	eng	Who asked for your opinion?
4013957	eng	Is that your professional opinion?
4013958	eng	Is that a personal opinion?
4013959	eng	Do you by any chance like opera?
4013960	eng	Is the bank still open?
4013961	eng	The back door is open.
4013962	eng	Tom pushed the gate open.
4013963	eng	Do you have a letter opener?
4013964	eng	Where's the bottle opener?
4013965	eng	Did you hear the door open?
4013966	eng	Why leave the door open?
4013967	eng	Why did you leave the door open?
4013968	eng	Someone left the door open.
4013969	eng	Tom went out and left the door open.
4013970	eng	All the other windows are open.
4013971	eng	What else are you working on?
4013972	eng	What medication is Tom on?
4013973	eng	Tom didn't have shoes on.
4013974	eng	What floor is your office on?
4013975	eng	All right, let's move on.
4013976	eng	You left your headlights on.
4013977	eng	Do you think Tom knows what's going on?
4013978	eng	Would somebody please tell me what's going on?
4013979	eng	Would someone mind telling me what's going on?
4013980	eng	All right, what's going on?
4013981	eng	Excuse me, what's going on?
4013982	eng	So what's been going on?
4013983	eng	Do you have any idea what's been going on?
4013984	eng	Why is this still going on?
4013985	eng	There was a lot going on.
4013986	eng	Everybody knew exactly what was going on.
4013987	eng	It's hard to figure out what's going on.
4013988	eng	Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
4013989	eng	It's unlikely Tom understands what's going on.
4013990	eng	What's the matter with this one?
4013991	eng	What was wrong with the old one?
4013992	eng	Are you sure Tom needs another one?
4013993	eng	When's the power going back on?
4013994	eng	The light came back on.
4013995	eng	It's what we agreed on.
4013996	eng	Just let me do the talking, OK?
4013997	eng	Look, I'm really sorry, OK?
4013998	eng	We'll talk about this later, OK?
4013999	eng	Just let me handle it, OK?
4014000	eng	Can you make sure that Tom is OK?
4014001	eng	It's really going to be OK.
4014002	eng	Let me look at this again, OK?
4014003	eng	Tom comes from the state of Ohio.
4014004	eng	Who does that remind you of?
4014005	eng	Tom doesn't play tennis very often.
4014006	eng	When I was in Boston, I'd play tennis with Tom quite often.
4014007	eng	What else are you going to get rid of?
4014008	eng	What are you accusing me of?
4014009	eng	What do you think this is made of?
4014010	eng	What do you suppose this is made of?
4014011	eng	Tom isn't used to being made fun of.
4014012	eng	Would you like me to turn the TV off?
4014013	eng	Will you stop showing off?
4014014	eng	What are you frightened of?
4014015	eng	If you're not watching the TV, turn it off.
4014016	eng	Is Tom still hanging around the office?
4014017	eng	I had lunch with Tom at a restaurant near the office.
4014018	eng	Tom and I work in the same office.
4014019	eng	How long have you been a police officer?
4014020	eng	Did you see anybody go into my office?
4014021	eng	Perhaps we should talk in my office.
4014022	eng	Please come to the main office.
4014023	eng	Go and see if Tom is in his office.
4014024	eng	Why did the alarm go off?
4014025	eng	Have you considered my offer?
4014026	eng	That's a very generous offer.
4014027	eng	Tom started taking his clothes off.
4014028	eng	It's already taken care of.
4014029	eng	It's been taken care of.
4014030	eng	Was that what you were afraid of?
4014031	eng	What do I have to be afraid of?
4014032	eng	Who should I be afraid of?
4014033	eng	Tom and Mary left Boston at the end of October.
4014034	eng	Tom and I are getting married in October.
4014035	eng	Tom and Mary are going to get hitched in October.
4014036	eng	Tom likes to dress up on special occasions.
4014037	eng	It's so painfully obvious.
4014038	eng	Are you sure this is the right number?
4014039	eng	What's your license plate number?
4014040	eng	What's Tom's office number?
4014041	eng	Do you still have my number?
4014042	eng	Why should I trust you now?
4014043	eng	OK, I'll stop worrying now.
4014044	eng	Tom has been sick in bed for a week now.
4014045	eng	What use is it to us now?
4014046	eng	What good is a boat going to do us now?
4014047	eng	Do you want to speak to Tom now?
4014048	eng	It's up to Tom now.
4014049	eng	I wonder what Tom is up to now.
4014050	eng	Do we have to talk about this now?
4014051	eng	Do we really need to decide this now?
4014052	eng	Perhaps we shouldn't be doing this now.
4014053	eng	It's too late for that now.
4014054	eng	It's probably not a good idea to do that now.
4014055	eng	Tom is working at a supermarket now.
4014056	eng	What's the situation now?
4014057	eng	Tom is studying in his room now.
4014058	eng	Please leave the room now.
4014059	eng	Do we need to decide this right now?
4014060	eng	Do you have any idea where Tom is right now?
4014061	eng	Are you on any medication right now?
4014062	eng	What's going on right now?
4014063	eng	What are you working on right now?
4014064	eng	Do you really have to call Tom right now?
4014065	eng	Aren't we supposed to be helping Tom right now?
4014066	eng	What are you thinking right now?
4014067	eng	Are you guys doing anything right now?
4014068	eng	Do you have a girlfriend right now?
4014069	eng	Tom says he isn't going to answer any more questions right now.
4014070	eng	I have no idea who has your car right now.
4014071	eng	Everything will be all right now.
4014072	eng	I have no idea what we should be doing right now.
4014073	eng	There are more important things we should be doing right now.
4014074	eng	Tom doesn't seem to be doing anything right now.
4014075	eng	Everyone needs to leave right now.
4014076	eng	That doesn't really seem appropriate right now.
4014077	eng	Tom is going through a rough time right now.
4014078	eng	It's just not a good time right now.
4014079	eng	I'm really scared right now.
4014080	eng	Does that mean you're ready now?
4014081	eng	Is Tom really a psychiatrist now?
4014082	eng	What are your plans now?
4014083	eng	Everybody hates each other now.
4014084	eng	What projects are you working on now?
4014085	eng	Everything's going to be OK now.
4014086	eng	What are you afraid of now?
4014087	eng	It's too late to change your mind now.
4014088	eng	I wish Tom were here with me now.
4014089	eng	What does that matter now?
4014090	eng	What difference does that make now?
4014091	eng	Would you mind leaving now?
4014092	eng	Do you think I'd leave now?
4014093	eng	It's impossible to change it now.
4014094	eng	Don't you have any idea where Tom is now?
4014095	eng	Do you have any idea where Tom is now?
4014096	eng	Is it OK for me to come in now?
4014097	eng	Does Tom have to do his homework now?
4014098	eng	I'm doing my homework now.
4014099	eng	Are you ready to go home now?
4014100	eng	Do you have to go home now?
4014101	eng	Does that mean I can go home now?
4014102	eng	What are you doing here now?
4014103	eng	Where are you guys heading now?
4014104	eng	Does this mean I can go now?
4014105	eng	Do you have a girlfriend now?
4014106	eng	Do you know what I'm doing now?
4014107	eng	What do you feel like doing now?
4014108	eng	I have no idea what we're supposed to be doing now.
4014109	eng	What do you expect us to do now?
4014110	eng	What do they plan to do now?
4014111	eng	What does Tom plan to do now?
4014112	eng	What are you planning to do now?
4014113	eng	What are we supposed to do now?
4014114	eng	What does Tom do now?
4014115	eng	What'll we do now?
4014116	eng	What do you propose we do now?
4014117	eng	Well, what should we do now?
4014118	eng	What do you think we should do now?
4014119	eng	What do you think I should do now?
4014120	eng	Why should it be any different now?
4014121	eng	Why are things different now?
4014122	eng	It doesn't make much difference now.
4014123	eng	All right, I'm in charge now.
4014124	eng	I'm in charge now.
4014125	eng	I'm the one in charge now.
4014126	eng	It may be too late to make any changes now.
4014127	eng	Shouldn't Tom be back by now?
4014128	eng	Shouldn't Tom be here by now?
4014129	eng	Shouldn't the pizza be here by now?
4014130	eng	Aren't you supposed to be gone by now?
4014131	eng	It should be working by now.
4014132	eng	Are you living in Boston now?
4014133	eng	Are you feeling better now?
4014134	eng	I feel so much better now.
4014135	eng	Look, I'm going to bed now.
4014136	eng	Why would Tom come back now?
4014137	eng	What are we looking at now?
4014138	eng	What are you two arguing about now?
4014139	eng	Do you mind if I ask why not?
4014140	eng	Would you mind if I ask why not?
4014141	eng	Well, do you want me to fix it or not?
4014142	eng	Are we going to do this or not?
4014143	eng	Are you going to help me with this or not?
4014144	eng	Look, are you going to help or not?
4014145	eng	Have you already decided whether you want to go or not?
4014146	eng	Have you decided whether you want to go or not?
4014147	eng	Are you going to go talk to Tom or not?
4014148	eng	Do you trust me or not?
4014149	eng	Do you want to help me or not?
4014150	eng	So are you going to help me or not?
4014151	eng	Are you coming with me or not?
4014152	eng	I don't know if Tom is coming or not.
4014153	eng	What symptoms have you noticed?
4014154	eng	When did you get this note?
4014155	eng	Why didn't you leave me a note?
4014156	eng	How could I possibly say no?
4014157	eng	Why couldn't you just say no?
4014158	eng	It looks like everything's back to normal.
4014159	eng	What's that horrible noise?
4014160	eng	The engine is making a funny noise.
4014161	eng	Are you going to go to Tom's concert tomorrow night?
4014162	eng	What are you doing tomorrow night?
4014163	eng	What are you guys doing tomorrow night?
4014164	eng	What time is the game tomorrow night?
4014165	eng	Why not spend the night?
4014166	eng	Did you see anybody else in the park that night?
4014167	eng	Have you thought about what we talked about the other night?
4014168	eng	Where were you Monday night?
4014169	eng	Where were you last Monday night?
4014170	eng	What are you doing for dinner Monday night?
4014171	eng	What are you doing Monday night?
4014172	eng	What else would I do on a Monday night?
4014173	eng	This is going to be a long night.
4014174	eng	Did you have fun at the party last night?
4014175	eng	Did Tom call you last night?
4014176	eng	By the way, where were you last night?
4014177	eng	Where were you guys last night?
4014178	eng	Didn't you enjoy dinner last night?
4014179	eng	How did things go last night?
4014180	eng	Did you see anyone else other than Tom last night?
4014181	eng	Were you working last night?
4014182	eng	Were you up late working last night?
4014183	eng	What were you doing up so late last night?
4014184	eng	Were any of you here last night?
4014185	eng	What exactly went on here last night?
4014186	eng	What time did you get home last night?
4014187	eng	Tom wrote this letter last night.
4014188	eng	I had a date with Tom last night.
4014189	eng	Tom and I both had the same dream last night.
4014190	eng	This package was delivered last night.
4014191	eng	This is an important night.
4014192	eng	It was a very cold night.
4014193	eng	Have you guys been up all night?
4014194	eng	Have you been out here all night?
4014195	eng	Tom said he was going to stay up all night.
4014196	eng	That would've been very nice.
4014197	eng	Why are you being so nice?
4014198	eng	This place is quite nice.
4014199	eng	Why can't you just be nice?
4014200	eng	Tom didn't know what to say next.
4014201	eng	Who do you think is going to get married next?
4014202	eng	What do you think we should do next?
4014203	eng	So what's the good news?
4014204	eng	I have some good news.
4014205	eng	Tom learned about Mary's death on the evening news.
4014206	eng	I know what's making Tom so nervous.
4014207	eng	Have you finally lost your nerve?
4014208	eng	This is a very bad neighborhood.
4014209	eng	This is a bad neighborhood.
4014210	eng	It was a very delicate negotiation.
4014211	eng	What kind of information do you need?
4014212	eng	I know exactly what you need.
4014213	eng	How much money do you think Tom needs?
4014214	eng	Tom said he'll help me get what I need.
4014215	eng	Tom said he'll help me get everything I need.
4014216	eng	Did you get the information you needed?
4014217	eng	Were you able to get everything you needed?
4014218	eng	Were you able to get any of the information we needed?
4014219	eng	It's nice to feel needed.
4014220	eng	Do you really think that's necessary?
4014221	eng	That's not really necessary.
4014222	eng	That isn't really necessary.
4014223	eng	That's no longer necessary.
4014224	eng	It's no longer necessary.
4014225	eng	Do you really think it's necessary?
4014226	eng	That probably isn't necessary.
4014227	eng	Do whatever you think is necessary.
4014228	eng	That may not be necessary.
4014229	eng	That might not be necessary.
4014230	eng	That'll no longer be necessary.
4014231	eng	Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
4014232	eng	Do you recognize any of these names?
4014233	eng	That's not his real name.
4014234	eng	That's a very pretty name.
4014235	eng	That's a really nice name.
4014236	eng	What was your mother's name?
4014237	eng	Tom didn't even mention Mary's name.
4014238	eng	What was the young man's name?
4014239	eng	Do you know how to spell Tom's last name?
4014240	eng	Is that your first name or your last name?
4014241	eng	Tom said he couldn't remember that guy's name.
4014242	eng	What was your father's name?
4014243	eng	It'll take longer to tell you how to do it than to just go ahead and do it myself.
4014244	eng	Do you mind if I help myself?
4014245	eng	Don't you think I can handle myself?
4014246	eng	Perhaps it would be better if I went by myself.
4014247	eng	Tom has always wanted to be a professional musician.
4014248	eng	I know that Tom likes classical music.

4014250	eng	Can you account for your whereabouts on the night of the murder?
4014251	eng	Tom has been arrested and charged with Mary's murder.
4014252	eng	This job doesn't pay very much.
4014253	eng	This is really too much.
4014254	eng	Does Tom always talk this much?
4014255	eng	It's really not that much.
4014256	eng	It's worth three times that much.
4014257	eng	Why does Tom cry so much?
4014258	eng	Why do Tom and Mary fight so much?
4014259	eng	Why do you hate Canadians so much?
4014260	eng	Why do you hate Boston so much?
4014261	eng	I wish you didn't hang out with Tom so much.
4014262	eng	Tom and I never really liked each other much.
4014263	eng	Tom never really liked me much.
4014264	eng	Does it hurt much?
4014265	eng	Could I borrow your lawn mower?
4014266	eng	Tom told me that he enjoyed the movie.
4014267	eng	What was the name of that movie?
4014268	eng	That was a pretty good movie.
4014269	eng	Tom felt the train begin to move.
4014270	eng	So what's the next move?
4014271	eng	Tom had a cigar in his mouth.
4014272	eng	Have you ever ridden a motorcycle?
4014273	eng	Tom has three cars and a motorcycle.
4014274	eng	It'll take us three, maybe four weeks at the most.
4014275	eng	Where were you yesterday morning?

4014277	eng	What were you looking for this morning?
4014278	eng	How did you get to work this morning?
4014279	eng	How're you all doing this morning?
4014280	eng	Were you here this morning?
4014281	eng	Guess what I saw this morning.
4014282	eng	Tom was looking for you this morning.
4014283	eng	You forget to take the trash out this morning.
4014284	eng	I wish I hadn't skipped breakfast this morning.
4014285	eng	I saw Tom at the supermarket this morning.
4014286	eng	I met Tom on my way school this morning.

4014294	eng	Please don't ask me anything more.
4014295	eng	Tom doesn't have enough money to pay all his bills this month.
4014296	eng	Tom thinks that Mary won't be able to pay all her bills this month.
4014297	eng	Tom has promised to pay back the money he owes by the end of the month.
4014298	eng	Where have you been for the past three months?
4014299	eng	It could take weeks, even months.
4014300	eng	Tom and Mary will get married next month.
4014301	eng	Tom was in Boston all last month.
4014302	eng	Tom told me that Mary got married last month.
4014303	eng	Did you just call me a monkey?
4014304	eng	Where's the rest of your money?
4014305	eng	Tom counted the money.
4014306	eng	Did you win a lot of money?
4014307	eng	Would you like to make more money?
4014308	eng	All Tom cares about is money.
4014309	eng	Tom counted his money.
4014310	eng	Are you sure we have enough money?
4014311	eng	How often do you borrow money?

4014319	eng	Tom and Mary flew to Boston last Monday.
4014320	eng	Tom hasn't been here since last Monday.
4014321	eng	Are we really going to do this every Monday?
4014322	eng	I'll never forget this moment.
4014323	eng	I don't want to forget this moment.
4014324	eng	It's only a theory at the moment.
4014325	eng	Would you excuse me just one moment?
4014326	eng	Will you excuse us for one moment?
4014327	eng	Would you two excuse me one moment?
4014328	eng	Can I speak to you a moment?
4014329	eng	Would you mind waiting here just a moment?

4014339	eng	This will only take a moment.
4014340	eng	This'll only take a moment.
4014341	eng	Have you ever thought about modeling?
4014342	eng	There might've been a mix-up.
4014343	eng	Are you sure there wasn't some kind of misunderstanding?
4014344	eng	It was really just a misunderstanding.
4014345	eng	I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.
4014346	eng	According to Tom, there was a misunderstanding.
4014347	eng	It was a simple mistake.
4014348	tur	Bunu ona verebilir misin?
4014349	eng	It was obviously some kind of mistake.
4014350	eng	It was an innocent mistake.
4014351	eng	Doing that would be a huge mistake.
4014352	eng	Was it an honest mistake?
4014353	eng	It was a genuine mistake.
4014354	eng	Tom may have taken my umbrella by mistake.
4014355	eng	Is there any chance this is a mistake?
4014356	eng	How long will it take before Tom realizes he's made a mistake?
4014357	eng	It was probably a mistake.
4014358	eng	It was very likely just a mistake.
4014359	eng	There's obviously been a mistake.
4014360	eng	Tom is likely to make a mistake.
4014361	eng	Obviously I made a mistake.
4014362	eng	Tom doesn't like looking in the mirror.
4014363	eng	I think that would only take about three minutes.
4014364	eng	That would take about three minutes.
4014365	eng	It'll only take three minutes.
4014366	eng	That should take about thirty minutes.
4014367	eng	That shouldn't take more than thirty minutes.
4014368	eng	It'll only take a couple of minutes.
4014369	eng	It should only take a couple of minutes.
4014370	eng	It'll just take a few more minutes.
4014371	eng	It should only take a couple more minutes.
4014372	eng	Come back in five minutes.

4014408	eng	What could've changed Tom's mind?
4014409	eng	Have you all lost your minds?
4014410	eng	Have you both lost your minds?
4014411	eng	Is it too late to change my mind?
4014412	eng	Maybe I'm losing my mind.
4014413	eng	Look, I've changed my mind.

4014449	eng	Can anyone explain this to me?
4014450	eng	Aren't you even going to listen to me?
4014451	eng	What makes you think Tom will listen to me?
4014452	eng	Why are you not listening to me?
4014453	eng	Is anyone listening to me?
4014454	eng	Do you think that Tom lied to me?
4014455	eng	It would mean a lot to me.
4014456	eng	No one ever listens to me.
4014457	eng	Please just listen to me.
4014458	eng	It matters a great deal to me.
4014459	eng	Tom has always been very good to me.
4014460	eng	Aren't you going to thank me?
4014461	eng	Isn't anyone going to thank me?
4014462	eng	What makes you think you're better than me?
4014463	eng	Tom didn't want to tell us how he and Mary had met.
4014464	eng	Is there anything you'd like to tell me?
4014465	eng	Was that all you wanted to tell me?
4014466	eng	Why does that not surprise me?
4014467	eng	Do you think you're going to be able to stop me?
4014468	eng	Don't try and stop me.
4014469	eng	It was a private message.
4014470	eng	Would you care to leave a message?
4014471	eng	What more can you show me?
4014472	eng	Are you going to shoot me?
4014473	eng	Why did you come to see me?
4014474	eng	Is that why you came to see me?
4014475	eng	It was just three weeks ago that Tom came to see me.
4014476	eng	Tom told me he was glad to see me.
4014477	eng	Was that supposed to scare me?
4014478	eng	Thank you for reminding me.
4014479	eng	Are you trying to poison me?
4014480	eng	I called Tom to apologize to him, but he hung up on me.
4014481	eng	Tom asked me if I had any cash on me.
4014482	eng	Please take your hands off me.

4014498	eng	Would you like to join me?
4014499	eng	How can you possibly help me?
4014500	eng	Excuse me, can you help me?
4014501	eng	Can one of you help me?
4014502	eng	Why are you trying to help me?
4014503	eng	Perhaps you could help me.
4014504	eng	Do you think Tom didn't hear me?
4014505	eng	Do you need anything else from me?
4014506	eng	Please don't run away from me.
4014507	eng	Do you think Tom will ever forgive me?
4014508	eng	Do you think this is easy for me?
4014509	eng	Do you think it was easy for me?
4014510	eng	Why didn't you wait for me?
4014511	eng	Can you please do this for me?

4014515	eng	Would you have waited for me?
4014516	eng	This coat is the perfect size for me.
4014517	eng	What on earth makes you think you can fool me?
4014518	eng	Did you think you could fool me?
4014519	eng	Would you please stop following me?

4014528	eng	Tom doesn't need to attend the meeting.
4014529	eng	This is a private meeting.

4014567	eng	What seems to be the matter?
4014568	eng	It was a private matter.
4014569	eng	This is a personal matter.
4014570	eng	This isn't a joking matter.

4014597	eng	Did Tom ever tell you how he first met Mary?
4014598	eng	I've asked Tom to go to the bus stop to meet Mary.
4014599	eng	There's no way Tom would ever marry Mary.
4014600	eng	Tom said he wanted to marry Mary.
4014601	eng	Why didn't you tell me Tom doesn't like Mary?

4014640	eng	What kind of deal did you make?
4014641	eng	Don't you have a speech to make?
4014642	eng	That's my decision to make.
4014643	eng	It's an easy mistake to make.
4014644	eng	What possible difference could that make?
4014645	eng	Do you know how much Tom makes?
4014646	eng	It's a mistake that many people make.
4014647	eng	It's very unlikely Tom knows how to play mahjong.
4014648	eng	I know what Tom did to make you mad.

4014754	eng	Would it help if I turned on the light?
4014755	eng	Did you flash your lights?
4014756	eng	What's the matter with the lights?
4014757	eng	Would you mind if I turned off the lights?
4014758	eng	Would anyone mind if I turned on some lights?
4014759	eng	Why aren't there any lights?
4014760	eng	There's plenty of light.
4014761	eng	Can you give me a lift?
4014762	eng	It was the happiest day of my life.
4014763	eng	I think I've just made the biggest mistake of my life.
4014764	eng	I didn't think Tom had a driver's license.
4014765	eng	Would you mind taking this book back to the library?
4014766	eng	I ran into Tom at the library.
4014767	eng	Tom met Mary in front of the library.
4014768	eng	Tom can't have written this letter.
4014769	eng	Tom showed me the letter.
4014770	eng	Did you ever show Tom that letter?
4014771	eng	Why didn't Tom answer Mary's letters?
4014772	eng	I intend to write Tom a letter.
4014773	eng	There's just one chair left.
4014774	eng	What do you charge for guitar lessons?
4014775	eng	What do you charge for lessons?
4014776	eng	How did you lose your leg?
4014777	eng	Just look at those legs.
4014778	eng	Tom slipped on the ice and hurt his leg.
4014779	eng	This may not even be legal.
4014780	eng	A lot has changed around here since you've left.
4014781	eng	Perhaps it would be best if you left.
4014782	eng	We still have half a bottle of wine left.
4014783	eng	Isn't it about time we left?
4014784	eng	Is there any hot water left?
4014785	eng	Do you want to know why Tom left?
4014786	eng	It's been almost a week since Tom left.
4014787	eng	There's very little time left.
4014788	eng	There were only three left.
4014789	eng	Do we have any sugar left?
4014790	eng	There's plenty of stuff left.
4014791	eng	There aren't any options left.
4014792	eng	Have you been in touch with Tom since he left?
4014793	eng	How many pills do you have left?
4014794	eng	What choices do I have left?
4014795	eng	Tom didn't even know that Mary had left.
4014796	eng	There's only a little bit left.
4014797	eng	There's hardly anything left.
4014798	eng	Are you sure everyone's already left?
4014799	eng	Everyone has already left.
4014800	eng	Tom tells me that you're leaving.
4014801	eng	Did Tom say why he was leaving?
4014802	eng	Did you ask Tom why he was leaving?
4014803	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he was leaving.
4014804	eng	Have you ever thought of leaving?
4014805	eng	No one's going to make us leave.
4014806	eng	Are you just going to let Tom leave?
4014807	eng	Why would Tom want Mary to leave?
4014808	eng	What time do you want to leave?
4014809	eng	Why would Tom want to leave?
4014810	eng	Why didn't you ask Tom to leave?
4014811	eng	Why did you ask Tom to leave?
4014812	eng	Does this mean I have to leave?
4014813	eng	Why should I have to leave?
4014814	eng	Are you asking me to leave?
4014815	eng	Tom and Mary were among the last to leave.
4014816	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want her to leave.
4014817	eng	Are you sure you don't mind if I leave?
4014818	eng	What time does the next bus leave?
4014819	eng	I guess I'd better leave.
4014820	eng	Actually, it's very easy to learn.
4014821	eng	Did you just call me lazy?
4014822	eng	Why did you become a lawyer?
4014823	eng	Tom used to be a lawyer.
4014824	eng	Is that against the law?
4014825	eng	It's not against the law.
4014826	eng	Tom is hanging up the laundry.
4014828	eng	Everyone in the room laughed.
4014829	eng	Why doesn't Tom ever work late?
4014830	eng	Are they paying you extra to work late?
4014831	eng	Maybe Tom had to work late.
4014832	eng	How do you know we're not too late?
4014833	eng	Maybe it's not too late.
4014834	eng	It's still not too late.
4014835	eng	By the time Tom realized what was happening, it was too late.
4014836	eng	It may already be too late.
4014837	eng	It may still not be too late.
4014838	eng	What are you guys doing up so late?
4014839	eng	What are you doing here so late?
4014840	eng	What're you doing here so late?
4014841	eng	It's not like Tom to be so late.
4014842	eng	Would you mind if we talked about this later?
4014843	eng	Would you mind if we discussed this later?
4014844	eng	Perhaps we can discuss this later.
4014845	eng	Perhaps we should discuss this later.
4014846	eng	Perhaps we'll have more time to talk later.
4014847	eng	Do you still want to see a movie later?
4014848	eng	Perhaps we can get a cup of coffee later.
4014849	eng	Perhaps we'll see you both later.
4014850	eng	Would you like us to come back later?
4014851	eng	Maybe I'll come back later.
4014852	eng	Maybe you could come back later.
4014853	eng	It really is quite late.
4014854	eng	It's getting pretty late.
4014855	eng	It's kind of late.
4014856	eng	It's getting kind of late.
4014857	eng	I'm a few minutes late.
4014858	eng	I'll be a few minutes late.
4014859	eng	What's the matter with you lately?
4014860	eng	Have you seen any good movies lately?
4014861	eng	Have you looked in a mirror lately?
4014862	eng	What have you done for me lately?
4014863	eng	Please excuse me for being late.
4014864	eng	Did Tom tell you that he'd be late?
4014865	eng	I told Tom that we'd probably be late.
4014866	eng	I bet Tom will be late.
4014867	eng	It would've been nice if Tom had told us he'd be late.
4014868	eng	Tom was afraid he'd be late.
4014869	eng	How long do you think the party will last?
4014870	eng	How long do you think the meeting will last?
4014871	eng	How long is this going to last?
4014872	eng	How long is the meeting going to last?
4014873	eng	Where were you and Tom the night before last?
4014874	eng	Please get off my land.
4014875	eng	Does Tom know you know?
4014876	eng	How much French do you know?
4014877	eng	If we need any help, I'll let you know.
4014878	eng	Let me know as soon as you know.
4014879	eng	It's not brain surgery, you know.
4014880	eng	You're not supposed to do that, you know.
4014881	eng	You don't have to do this, you know.
4014882	eng	What more is there to know?
4014883	eng	Did you find out what you wanted to know?
4014884	eng	Why did you think I didn't need to know?
4014885	eng	What more do I need to know?
4014886	eng	Tom has already told me what I wanted to know.
4014887	eng	What does it matter who knows?
4014888	eng	How could you possibly know?
4014889	eng	Tom is the smartest guy I know.
4014890	eng	Tom is one of the nicest guys I know.
4014891	eng	Is there anything you don't know?
4014892	eng	Tom cut the rope with his knife.
4014893	eng	Tom went down to the kitchen.
4014894	eng	You left the light on in the kitchen.
4014895	eng	There's a phone in the kitchen.
4014896	eng	Bring me the first aid kit.
4014897	eng	Have you two been kissing?
4014898	eng	Is that a weapon of some kind?
4014899	eng	Tom weighs as least 70 kilograms.
4014900	eng	How many people were killed?
4014901	eng	Three hostages were killed.
4014902	eng	How old were you when your father was killed?
4014903	eng	Do you realize you could've been killed?
4014904	eng	Who's the strongest kid?
4014905	eng	Who's watching the kids?
4014906	eng	Thanks for taking care of the kids.
4014907	eng	This would be such a great place to raise kids.
4014908	eng	This would be a good place to raise kids.
4014909	eng	Who do you think you're kidding?
4014910	eng	Do I look like I'm kidding?
4014911	eng	Tom lived on Park Street when he was a kid.
4014912	eng	Tom has been collecting stamps since he was a kid.
4014913	eng	My father gave it to me when I was a kid.
4014914	eng	My parents died when I was a kid.
4014915	eng	Have you seen my car keys?
4014916	eng	Can I borrow your car keys?
4014917	eng	Why would I take your car keys?
4014918	eng	Here, use my key.
4014919	eng	Would you like some fruit juice?
4014920	eng	Tom is the only one who laughs at Mary's jokes.
4014921	eng	Is this some sort of joke?
4014922	eng	Is that supposed to be a joke?
4014923	eng	It wasn't meant as a joke.
4014924	eng	It was just supposed to be a joke.
4014925	eng	Tom told Mary why she shouldn't go out with John.
4014926	eng	My name isn't Tom. It's John.
4014927	eng	My name's not Tom. It's John.
4014928	eng	I talked to Tom and Mary while I was waiting for John.
4014929	eng	Tom asked Mary to help him find John.
4014930	eng	Tom, this is Mary's brother John.
4014931	eng	I don't think Tom is as good-looking as John.
4014932	eng	I don't think Tom is as handsome as John.
4014933	eng	Can you tell me more about your job?
4014934	eng	Are you quitting your job?
4014935	eng	How long have you been doing this job?
4014936	eng	How long have you had this job?
4014937	eng	Tom said he couldn't accept the job.
4014938	eng	Tom didn't apply for the job.
4014939	eng	I wonder why Tom turned down that job.
4014940	eng	Tom has found a good teaching job.
4014941	eng	Tom found a good teaching job.
4014942	eng	Tom isn't used to his new job.
4014943	eng	Why did you leave your last job?
4014944	eng	Did they offer you a job?
4014945	eng	Do you know anyone who needs a job?
4014946	eng	Why aren't you looking for a job?
4014947	eng	Why are you looking for a job?
4014948	eng	Tom spent all day looking for a job.
4014949	eng	Tom sounded slightly jealous.
4014950	eng	How did you end up in jail?
4014951	eng	Tom took care of Mary's dog while she was in jail.
4014952	eng	There are many innocent men in jail.
4014953	eng	The horse that won the race is owned by Tom Jackson.
4014954	eng	The man you met yesterday was Tom Jackson.
4014955	eng	I'd like to speak to Tom Jackson.
4014956	eng	Have you met the Jacksons?
4014957	eng	Why didn't Tom take off his jacket?
4014958	eng	What's the matter with it?
4014959	eng	What do you intend to do with it?
4014960	eng	What are we supposed to do with it?
4014961	eng	Would you have time to help me with it?
4014962	eng	That was pretty interesting, wasn't it?
4014963	eng	That was very interesting, wasn't it?
4014964	eng	That was a great movie, wasn't it?
4014965	eng	What kind of car was it?
4014966	eng	That wasn't too much, was it?
4014967	eng	That wasn't very convincing, was it?
4014968	eng	That wasn't accurate, was it?
4014969	eng	Have you ever tried using it?
4014970	eng	Let me show you how to use it.
4014971	eng	Everyone's looking forward to it.
4014972	eng	If Tom had had something to throw, he'd have thrown it.
4014973	eng	Do you think I should take it?
4014974	eng	Do the police have any idea who stole it?
4014975	eng	Someone might try to steal it.
4014976	eng	Have you ever actually seen it?
4014977	eng	Are we ever going to see it?
4014978	eng	When was the last time you saw it?
4014979	eng	There'll come a day when you'll regret it.
4014980	eng	Did you bother to read it?
4014981	eng	Did you really expect Tom to read it?
4014982	eng	There's no need to prove it.
4014983	eng	Tom went to the window and opened it.
4014984	eng	Aren't you going to open it?
4014985	eng	Would you like me to hold onto it?
4014986	eng	Tom handed Mary a piece of paper with his address written on it.
4014987	eng	So why can't you take care of it?
4014988	eng	Would you like me to take care of it?
4014989	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't like her scarf, so she got rid of it.
4014990	eng	Do you think you're going to need it?
4014991	eng	Of course, I don't need it.
4014992	eng	If we hurry, we can still make it.
4014993	eng	It's almost too easy, isn't it?
4014994	eng	It's all right now, isn't it?
4014995	eng	Well, that's what you want, isn't it?
4014996	eng	It's a good plan, isn't it?
4014997	eng	It's all a little confusing, isn't it?
4014998	eng	It's very impressive, isn't it?
4014999	eng	It's almost too good to be true, isn't it?
4015000	eng	It's pretty romantic, isn't it?
4015001	eng	What kind of sandwich is it?
4015002	eng	What kind of medicine is it?
4015003	eng	What kind of place is it?
4015004	eng	It's not easy being a parent, is it?
4015005	eng	That's not entirely true, is it?
4015006	eng	Was I supposed to just ignore it?
4015007	eng	Did you see where Tom hid it?
4015008	eng	It's been quite a day, hasn't it?
4015009	eng	Did you find out who has it?
4015010	eng	What if Tom can't handle it?
4015011	eng	Are you sure you can handle it?
4015012	eng	Are you sure Tom can handle it?
4015013	eng	All right, let's just forget it.
4015014	eng	I don't know what Tom paid for it.
4015015	eng	If I had wanted it, I would've asked for it.
4015016	eng	Are you saying you can't fix it?
4015017	eng	Do you think you can fix it?
4015018	eng	Are you saying you can fix it?
4015019	eng	Why didn't Tom find it?
4015020	eng	Are you going to help me find it?
4015021	eng	Let me see if I can find it.
4015022	eng	What's the point of fighting it?
4015024	tur	Üç kişi, onlardan ikisi ölene kadar bir sırrı saklayabilir.
4015025	tur	Kaçakçı olduğunu biliyordum.
4015026	eng	Who else might've done it?
4015027	eng	Is it possible Tom could've done it?
4015028	eng	Everybody else is doing it.
4015029	eng	It really doesn't matter, does it?
4015030	eng	It doesn't make any sense, does it?
4015031	eng	It doesn't seem to make much sense, does it?
4015032	eng	Are you sure Tom didn't do it?
4015033	eng	Are you sure this is the best way to do it?
4015034	eng	What's the best way to do it?
4015035	eng	How did you get Tom to do it?
4015036	eng	Did Tom say how he was able to do it?
4015037	eng	How am I supposed to do it?
4015038	eng	Are you sure you can do it?
4015039	eng	Are you sure Tom can do it?
4015040	eng	What makes you think I can do it?
4015041	eng	Are you saying that you don't think I can do it?
4015042	eng	Did you actually see Tom do it?
4015043	eng	Do you think I should do it?
4015044	eng	Tom said he couldn't do it.
4015045	eng	Tom insisted that he didn't do it.
4015046	eng	It seemed like the only way to do it.
4015047	eng	You seem to know how to do it.
4015048	eng	Tom probably didn't mean to do it.
4015049	eng	Please don't make me do it.
4015050	eng	Do you think Tom really did it?
4015051	eng	Did you find out who did it?
4015052	eng	How did you figure out Tom was the one who did it?
4015053	eng	Did anybody ask Tom why he did it?
4015054	eng	Did you ask Tom why he did it?
4015055	eng	Did Tom say how he did it?
4015056	eng	That didn't go very well, did it?
4015057	eng	I'm pretty sure that's not why Tom did it.
4015058	eng	That's not why Tom did it.
4015059	eng	I know that Tom did it.
4015060	eng	How would you describe it?
4015061	eng	Tom went to the window and closed it.
4015062	eng	What could be causing it?
4015063	eng	It can't really be that easy, can it?
4015064	eng	It can't be that easy, can it?
4015065	eng	Did Tom tell you where he bought it?
4015066	eng	Did you take a look at it?
4015067	eng	Do you really think we can afford it?
4015068	eng	How did Tom even know about it?
4015069	eng	Well, what do you plan to do about it?
4015070	eng	What do you plan to do about it?
4015071	eng	What am I going to do about it?
4015072	eng	What do you intend to do about it?
4015073	eng	Is there anything you can do about it?

4015075	eng	Did you complain about it?
4015076	eng	Have you talked to Tom about it?
4015077	eng	Do you ever think about it?
4015078	eng	What does Tom think about it?
4015079	eng	Are you ready to talk about it?
4015080	eng	Would you like to talk about it?
4015081	eng	No one's supposed to know about it.
4015082	eng	Tom probably didn't even know about it.
4015083	eng	You seem to know a lot about it.
4015084	eng	Tom knew there was nothing he could do about it.
4015085	eng	Make sure we ask Tom about it.
4015086	eng	I'm not supposed to talk about it.
4015087	eng	Everyone's been talking about it.
4015088	eng	Can any of you tell me where Tom is?
4015089	eng	Do you have any idea where Tom is?
4015090	eng	Do you know how old Tom is?

4015105	eng	Do you know where the money is?
4015106	eng	Do you know what the speed limit is?
4015107	eng	Isn't that the way it is?
4015108	eng	Are you telling me you don't know where it is?
4015109	eng	It's really not as hard to do as you think it is.
4015110	eng	Tom's girlfriend is a lot younger than he is.
4015111	eng	Tom's girlfriend is quite a bit younger than he is.
4015112	eng	Tom's girlfriend is three years younger than he is.
4015113	eng	Tom's new girlfriend is much younger than he is.
4015114	eng	Where do you think everyone else is?
4015115	eng	Do you know what color Tom's car is?
4015116	eng	What department are you in?
4015117	eng	What kind of business are you in?
4015118	eng	Tom opened the door and I went in.
4015119	eng	There's no other way in.
4015120	eng	Why wasn't Tom invited?
4015121	eng	Why wasn't I invited?
4015122	eng	What am I getting myself into?
4015123	eng	What kind of trouble is Tom in?
4015124	eng	What kind of business was Tom in?
4015125	eng	It wasn't a job interview.
4015126	eng	Tom was our interpreter.
4015127	eng	It's really not very interesting.
4015128	eng	Actually, it was very interesting.
4015129	eng	That was very interesting.
4015130	eng	It's really not that interesting.
4015131	eng	It's actually kind of interesting.
4015132	eng	Was that supposed to be interesting?
4015133	eng	Did Tom tell you anything interesting?
4015134	eng	Did you see anything interesting?
4015135	eng	Was that intended as an insult?
4015136	eng	It was a truly inspirational.
4015137	eng	It's warmer in the house. Let's go inside.
4015138	eng	This door is locked from inside.
4015139	eng	Are you ready to come inside?
4015140	eng	Are you sure you don't want to come inside?
4015141	eng	Please come back inside.
4015142	eng	Spiders aren't insects.
4015143	eng	Have you gone completely insane?
4015144	eng	Do you really think Tom is innocent?
4015145	eng	Do you really think Tom could be innocent?
4015146	eng	Is somebody going to let me in?
4015147	eng	If Tom's not careful, he's going to get injured.
4015148	eng	Please feel free to join in.
4015149	eng	Tom is the guy that Mary is interested in.
4015150	eng	Tom is one of the guys that Mary is interested in.
4015151	eng	Do you think we ought to go in?
4015152	eng	If you don't have this key, you won't be able to get in.
4015153	eng	According to Tom's doctors, his condition is incurable.
4015154	eng	This place is incredible.
4015155	eng	It really is an inconvenience.
4015156	eng	Do you mind if we come in?
4015157	eng	Tom lives in the house he was born in.
4015158	eng	It's hard to know exactly what to believe in.
4015159	eng	Are you sure this is the room we're supposed to be in?
4015160	eng	Keep your door locked and don't let anyone in.
4015161	eng	There's some room for improvement.
4015162	eng	It's really quite impressive.
4015163	eng	Tom seemed very impressed.
4015164	eng	It's difficult but not impossible.
4015165	eng	Do you really think it's impossible?
4015166	eng	It's not very important.
4015167	eng	It's very, very important.
4015168	eng	What could possibly be that important?
4015169	eng	What, may I ask, is so important?
4015170	eng	It's really not important.
4015171	eng	Do you really think it's important?
4015172	eng	Why is alternative energy important?
4015173	eng	What exactly are you implying?
4015174	eng	Tom needs to get to the hospital immediately.
4015175	eng	It's almost impossible to imagine.
4015176	eng	It could just be an illusion.
4015177	eng	This is definitely illegal.
4015178	eng	Do you think I'm some kind of idiot?
4015179	eng	I never had a chance, did I?
4015180	eng	I'm not sure if Tom will like this idea.
4015181	eng	That's not such a terrible idea.
4015182	eng	Tom has a lot of original ideas.
4015183	eng	It seemed like such a simple idea.
4015184	eng	That's a very intriguing idea.
4015185	eng	Don't you think it's a good idea?
4015186	eng	Does anyone here think that's a good idea?
4015187	eng	Are you sure that's a good idea?
4015188	eng	This may not be a very good idea.
4015189	eng	This might not be a very good idea.
4015190	eng	Maybe it's not a good idea.
4015191	eng	Maybe that's a good idea.
4015192	eng	Maybe that's not such a good idea.
4015193	eng	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
4015194	eng	This wasn't such a good idea.
4015195	eng	This may not be such a good idea.
4015196	eng	This might not be such a good idea.
4015197	eng	Listen, I have a good idea.
4015198	eng	This may not be a good idea.
4015199	eng	This might not be a good idea.
4015200	eng	That sounds like a fine idea.
4015201	eng	Are you sure this is such a bright idea?
4015202	eng	Doing that would be a very bad idea.
4015203	eng	It's definitely a bad idea.
4015204	eng	This is probably a bad idea.
4015205	eng	That's probably not a bad idea.
4015206	eng	Actually, it's not a bad idea.
4015208	eng	That's not such a bad idea.
4015209	eng	Do you want some ice?
4015210	eng	It was only a hypothesis.
4015211	eng	Have you ever been hypnotized?
4015212	eng	Tom told everyone that he was Mary's husband.
4015213	eng	Are you sure this isn't going to hurt?
4015214	eng	How long has your throat been hurting?
4015215	eng	Someone could get hurt.
4015216	eng	Why exactly were you in such a hurry?
4015217	eng	Where are they going in such a hurry?
4015218	eng	Where are you going in such a hurry?
4015219	eng	Are you sure Tom is a bounty hunter?
4015220	eng	I'm not that hungry.
4015222	eng	Are you sure you're not hungry?
4015223	eng	Are you saying I have no sense of humor?
4015224	eng	Does Tom have a sense of humor?
4015225	eng	Where exactly is your house?
4015226	eng	How far are we from your house?
4015227	eng	There are now three cars parked in front of your house.
4015228	eng	Are you absolutely sure this is Tom's house?
4015229	eng	Do you still have a key to the house?
4015230	eng	Why did Tom let you in the house?
4015231	eng	Who else was in the house?
4015232	eng	Are you sure you were the only one in the house?
4015233	eng	Were there any other people in the house?
4015234	eng	Come on, let's go back to the house.
4015235	eng	Tom was about to leave the house.
4015236	eng	The sound is coming from inside the house.
4015237	eng	Does Tom have a summer house?
4015238	eng	I told Tom how to get to our house.
4015239	eng	This is a very nice house.
4015240	eng	Have you seen Tom's new house?
4015241	eng	How soon can you get to my house?
4015242	eng	Tom's car is parked in front of Mary's house.
4015243	eng	Tom lives in a large house.
4015244	eng	Tom asked his mother if he could spend the night at John's house.
4015245	eng	Tom wants somebody to help him paint his house.
4015246	eng	Tom hired Mary to clean his house.
4015247	eng	I think Tom should sell his house.
4015248	eng	Tom lives in a brown house.
4015249	eng	What have you been doing for the last three hours?
4015250	eng	What's been going on here for the last three hours?
4015251	eng	It'll take approximately three hours.
4015252	eng	It'll take at least three hours.
4015253	eng	It'll be here within three hours.
4015254	eng	It shouldn't take more than three hours.
4015255	eng	My shift's over in a couple of hours.
4015256	eng	What are you doing for the next few hours?
4015257	eng	Could you spare a few hours?
4015258	eng	It'll be dark in a few hours.
4015259	eng	That'll take a couple hours.
4015260	eng	Is there any chance you could be ready in an hour?
4015261	eng	This should only take about an hour.
4015262	eng	It's really not that hot.
4015263	eng	It's definitely getting hotter.
4015264	eng	Call me as soon as you get to your hotel.
4015265	eng	Would you mind taking me back to my hotel?
4015266	eng	Tom checked in at the Hilton Hotel.
4015267	eng	They killed three more hostages.
4015268	eng	Are you being held hostage?
4015269	eng	Is Tom still in the hospital?
4015270	eng	Let me take you to the hospital.
4015271	eng	Tom and Mary are both in the hospital.
4015272	eng	Tom works at a local hospital.
4015273	eng	Perhaps we should get you to a hospital.
4015274	eng	Mr. Jackson gave us some homework.
4015275	eng	The problem is that Tom doesn't always do his homework.
4015276	eng	Tom wants you to help him do his homework.
4015277	eng	Tom said he would do his homework.
4015278	eng	It took Tom several hours to finish his homework.
4015279	eng	It took Tom almost three hours to finish his homework.
4015280	eng	Tom finished his homework.
4015281	eng	I ran into Tom on my way home.
4015282	eng	Tom missed the last train and had to take a taxi home.
4015283	eng	Would you like me to give you a ride home?
4015284	eng	Tom couldn't find anyone to give him a ride home.
4015285	eng	Thanks for driving me home.
4015286	eng	Tom was kind enough to drive me home.
4015287	eng	Tom didn't offer to drive Mary home.
4015288	eng	Did Tom drive himself home?
4015289	eng	Tom wanted to finish cleaning the house before Mary got home.
4015290	eng	Tom went to bed as soon as he got home.
4015291	eng	Almost everyone has already gone home.
4015292	eng	Everyone else has gone home.
4015293	eng	Could you all please just go home?
4015294	eng	Tom said that it was time to go home.
4015295	eng	How are you getting home?
4015296	eng	Wake me up when you get home.
4015297	eng	It took Tom almost three hours to get home.
4015298	eng	Let's talk about this when we get home.
4015299	eng	Why wouldn't Tom want to come home?
4015300	eng	When are you going to come home?
4015301	eng	How often does Tom come home?
4015302	eng	Tom says he won't let you come home.
4015303	eng	Are your parents going to be home?
4015304	eng	Do you want to go back home?
4015305	eng	Are you moving back home?
4015306	eng	How's everything back home?
4015307	eng	Are you sure you're ready to come back home?
4015308	eng	How did you persuade Tom to come back home?
4015309	eng	Let me take you back home.
4015310	eng	Do you know whether or not Tom is at home?
4015311	eng	Tom doesn't have much money with him.
4015312	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the zoo with him.
4015313	eng	Tom knew that Mary wouldn't want to go with him.
4015314	eng	Tom persuaded Mary to go to Boston with him.
4015315	eng	Tom asked me to go to Boston with him.
4015316	eng	Tom talked Mary into going to Boston with him.
4015317	eng	Tom thinks I'm in love with him.
4015318	eng	Tom persuaded Mary to go the dance with him.
4015319	eng	Tom asked Mary to go to the opera with him.
4015320	eng	Do you know why Tom killed himself?
4015321	eng	Are you sure Tom can do it by himself?
4015322	eng	Are you sure Tom can handle it by himself?
4015323	eng	Do you think Tom is strong enough to lift that by himself?
4015324	eng	Tom managed to carry both suitcases by himself.
4015325	eng	Tom said he would do his homework by himself.
4015326	eng	Tom didn't mind living by himself.
4015327	eng	I wish Tom would behave himself.
4015328	eng	Tom might've been there yesterday, but I didn't see him.
4015329	eng	Tom's heart stopped, but the doctors managed to revive him.
4015330	eng	Tom was married to Mary when I first met him.
4015331	eng	Tom was wearing a black hat when I first met him.
4015332	eng	I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
4015333	eng	Tom loves Mary and she loves him.
4015334	eng	I wish I'd never told Tom that I loved him.
4015335	eng	Tom asked me if I would mind helping him.
4015336	eng	Tom wants somebody to help him.
4015337	eng	I know that Tom expects me to help him.
4015338	eng	Tom paid for his lunch with the money his mother had given him.
4015339	eng	Tom shot a bear with the rifle his father gave him.
4015340	eng	Tom's parents live three miles from him.
4015341	eng	Tom hoped that Mary would forgive him.
4015342	eng	Tom ate the salad that Mary made for him.
4015343	eng	What could Tom possibly have to hide?
4015344	eng	There's no need to hide.
4015345	eng	Tom knew that Mary wanted him to go to Boston with her.
4015346	eng	Tom wished he hadn't promised Mary he'd go to Boston with her.
4015347	eng	Tom advised Mary to take better care of herself.
4015348	eng	Tom asked Mary to behave herself.
4015349	eng	Tom wished he hadn't told Mary he loved her.
4015350	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary that he loved her.
4015351	eng	Mary didn't even let Tom kiss her.
4015352	eng	Tom knew that Mary wanted him to help her.
4015353	eng	Tom promised Mary that he would help her.
4015354	eng	No one knows you're here.
4015355	eng	How did you know I'd follow you here?
4015356	eng	It's good to have you here.
4015358	eng	Why are you working here?
4015359	eng	How long have you worked here?
4015360	eng	Excuse me, do you work here?
4015361	eng	Have you ever spent winter here?
4015362	eng	What would you do if I weren't here?
4015363	eng	Who else knew you were here?
4015364	eng	Do you ever wonder why we're here?
4015365	eng	Does anyone know we're here?
4015366	eng	Do you think Tom knew Mary was here?
4015367	eng	Don't you want to know why Tom was here?
4015368	eng	When was the last time Tom was here?
4015369	eng	Did Tom say why he was here?
4015370	eng	Do you think Tom knew I was here?
4015371	eng	Would you mind if we waited here?
4015372	eng	Why is Tom making us wait here?
4015373	eng	How long do we have to wait here?
4015374	eng	How long should I wait here?
4015375	eng	There are just the two of us here.
4015376	eng	What are you doing up here?
4015377	eng	There's no buried treasure here.
4015378	eng	It's kind of close to here.
4015379	eng	Perhaps we shouldn't be talking about this here.
4015380	eng	Perhaps we shouldn't be doing this here.
4015381	eng	Could you not do that here?
4015382	eng	How long have you been a teacher here?
4015383	eng	How long are we going to be stuck here?
4015384	eng	Why don't we just stay here?
4015385	eng	Don't you think we'd better stay here?
4015386	eng	How long am I supposed to stay here?
4015387	eng	Can't you see I'm in the middle of something here?
4015388	eng	There's usually someone here.
4015389	eng	There are some sandwiches here.
4015390	eng	There's no more room here.
4015391	eng	Would you sign right here?
4015392	eng	I'll wait right here.
4015393	eng	It should be right here.
4015394	eng	Why are there still people here?
4015395	eng	Is everything all right out here?
4015396	eng	How long have you been out here?
4015397	eng	How long have you two been out here?
4015398	eng	What are you guys doing out here?
4015399	eng	What are you boys doing out here?
4015400	eng	What are you two doing out here?
4015401	eng	What exactly is going on here?
4015402	eng	What in the world is going on here?
4015403	eng	Would you tell me what's going on here?
4015404	eng	Can somebody please tell me what's going on here?
4015405	eng	All right, what's going on here?
4015406	eng	What's the fastest way out of here?
4015407	eng	Is there another way out of here?
4015408	eng	Is there any other way out of here?
4015409	eng	There seems to be no way out of here.
4015410	eng	Let's get you out of here.
4015411	eng	All right, let's get out of here.
4015412	eng	Come on, let's get out of here.
4015413	eng	Everyone needs to get out of here.
4015414	eng	Please get me out of here.
4015415	eng	There's obviously nobody here.
4015416	eng	Did you spend the night here?
4015417	eng	It's kind of nice here.
4015418	eng	How long ago did you move here?
4015419	eng	Why have you brought me here?
4015420	eng	Why did you bring me here?
4015421	eng	Someone's meeting me here.
4015422	eng	Thanks for meeting me here.
4015423	eng	Please don't leave me here.
4015424	eng	Do you like living here?
4015425	eng	How can you stand living here?
4015426	eng	Did I leave my keys here?
4015427	eng	It never occurred to me that Tom wouldn't like it here.
4015428	eng	Do you know what the speed limit is here?
4015429	eng	Why is everybody in here?
4015430	eng	Why is it so dark in here?

4015445	eng	No one's allowed in here.
4015446	eng	Who wouldn't be happy here?
4015447	eng	Do you think you'll be happy here?
4015448	eng	It's doubtful that anything will grow here.
4015449	eng	I was sleeping when Tom got here.
4015450	eng	Tom has done nothing but complain ever since he got here.
4015451	eng	Let's go as soon as Tom gets here.

4015453	eng	How did these drugs get here?
4015454	eng	When was Tom supposed to get here?
4015455	eng	How did Tom's umbrella get here?

4015463	eng	Are you all finished here?
4015464	eng	What do you expect to find here?

4015487	eng	You weren’t supposed to come here.
4015488	eng	According to this map, there used to be a church here.
4015489	eng	Are your wife and children here?
4015490	eng	Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
4015491	eng	When was the last time Tom came here?
4015492	eng	Do you know why I came here?
4015493	eng	Have you ever wondered what might've happened if Tom hadn't been here?
4015494	eng	Tom has never been here.
4015495	eng	It would've been nice if Tom had been here.
4015496	eng	Are you saying I shouldn't be here?
4015497	eng	How long are you going to be here?
4015498	eng	Are you supposed to be here?
4015499	eng	How did you know we'd be here?
4015500	eng	What time did Tom say he'd be here?
4015501	eng	How did you know I'd be here?
4015502	eng	I forgot Tom was going to be here.
4015503	eng	No one is supposed to be here.
4015504	eng	What brings you back here?
4015505	eng	What's going on back here?
4015506	eng	What's Tom doing back here?
4015507	eng	When are you coming back here?
4015508	eng	Do you think you'll ever come back here?
4015509	eng	Do you really think Tom will come back here?
4015510	eng	What do you do for fun around here?
4015511	eng	What's really going on around here?
4015512	eng	What time do restaurants close around here?
4015513	eng	It's awfully noisy at night around here.
4015514	eng	It's pretty quiet around here.
4015515	eng	Thanks so much for all your help.
4015516	eng	Listen, we need your help.
4015517	eng	Thanks so much for your help.
4015518	eng	Maybe therapy would help.
4015519	eng	How are we going to do this without Tom's help?
4015520	eng	Perhaps we shouldn't be trying to do this without Tom's help.
4015521	eng	Perhaps we shouldn't be doing this without Tom's help.
4015522	eng	Isn't there anything we can do to help?
4015523	eng	Is there anything that I can do to help?
4015524	eng	Is there anything we could do to help?
4015525	eng	How did you get Tom to help?
4015526	eng	Were you able to convince Tom to help?
4015527	eng	Can't you see I'm trying to help?
4015528	eng	Can't we do anything to help?
4015529	eng	Why did you agree to help?
4015530	eng	Who am I supposed to help?
4015531	eng	It might be a good idea to ask Tom to help.
4015533	eng	I've asked Tom to help.
4015534	eng	Do any of you want some help?
4015535	eng	Maybe we should get some help.
4015536	eng	Maybe I could be of some help.
4015537	eng	Look, I really need some help.
4015538	eng	Do you really think you can do that without our help?
4015539	eng	Tom said he didn't need our help.
4015540	eng	Perhaps Tom needs help.
4015541	eng	Maybe Tom needs help.
4015542	eng	Do any of you need help?
4015543	eng	Why didn't you just ask for my help?
4015544	eng	Are you asking for my help?
4015545	eng	Are you sure you don't need my help?
4015546	eng	Tom managed to put out the fire with Mary's help.
4015547	eng	This isn't really helping.
4015548	eng	Tom wished he hadn't promised Mary he'd help.
4015549	eng	I think that would be very helpful.
4015550	eng	That would be very helpful.
4015551	eng	Is Tom always this helpful?
4015552	eng	Is Tom always so helpful?
4015553	eng	I think that would be extremely helpful.
4015554	eng	That would be extremely helpful.
4015555	eng	Was that you yelling for help?
4015556	eng	Wouldn't it be easier if Tom helped?
4015557	eng	How did you manage to do that without any help?
4015558	eng	Do you really think you can do that without any help?
4015559	eng	Are you going to be able to do this without any help?
4015560	eng	Do you think we'll be able to do this without any help?
4015561	eng	Do you think Tom really did this without any help?
4015562	eng	Do you expect me to believe you did this without any help?
4015563	eng	Are you sure you don't want any help?
4015564	eng	Are you sure Tom didn't have any help?
4015565	eng	Are you sure you don't need any help?
4015566	eng	What makes you think I need any help?
4015567	eng	Did you ask Tom to come over and help?
4015568	eng	Tom is really good-looking, isn't he?
4015569	eng	Tom doesn't like apples, does he?
4015570	eng	Tom did the right thing, didn't he?
4015571	eng	Tom seemed very tired, didn't he?
4015572	eng	Tom didn't play tennis, did he?
4015573	eng	Tom didn't pass the exam, did he?
4015574	eng	Things got a bit hectic.
4015575	eng	It's really not that heavy.
4015576	eng	These suitcases are really heavy.
4015577	eng	These suitcases are kind of heavy.
4015578	eng	These suitcases are heavy.
4015579	eng	Is that what you wanted to hear?
4015580	eng	That was really nice to hear.
4015581	eng	Tom didn't believe what he heard.
4015582	eng	Tom spoke very quietly, but loud enough to be heard.
4015583	eng	Put your hands on your head.
4015584	eng	Did Tom say which way he'd be heading?
4015585	eng	Is this the best you have?
4015586	eng	What kind of car do you have?
4015587	eng	What kind of training do you have?
4015588	eng	How much free time do you have?
4015589	eng	What kind of insurance do you have?
4015590	eng	What kind of trouble did you have?
4015591	eng	What color hair does Tom have?
4015592	eng	Did Tom say anything he shouldn't have?
4015593	eng	What other reason could I have?
4015594	eng	This is the only pair of shoes I have.
4015595	eng	This is the only tie I have.
4015596	eng	Where did you get the hat?
4015597	eng	The keys are on the dresser next to my hat.
4015598	eng	I can't find my hat.
4015599	eng	Tom doesn't think he's smart enough to get into Harvard.
4015600	eng	Tom must've practiced very hard.
4015601	eng	That shouldn't be too hard.
4015602	eng	This shouldn't be this hard.
4015603	eng	Come on, it's not that hard.
4015604	eng	This shouldn't be so hard.
4015605	eng	Tom asked me why I worked so hard.
4015606	eng	Did you expect something different to happen?
4015607	eng	What could possibly cause that to happen?
4015608	eng	Are you absolutely certain that's not going to happen?
4015609	eng	Did Tom explain to you what's going to happen?
4015610	eng	I was half expecting this to happen.
4015611	eng	It's not unusual for this kind of thing to happen.
4015612	eng	That really wasn't supposed to happen.
4015614	eng	I didn't think that was supposed to happen.
4015615	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't care about what happens.
4015616	eng	It never occurred to me that this might happen.
4015617	eng	Did you actually see it happen?
4015618	eng	It took Tom a moment to realize what was happening.
4015619	eng	There's not any chance of that happening.
4015620	eng	What did Tom say about what happened?
4015621	eng	Did Tom ever say anything to you about what happened?
4015622	eng	Did Tom say anything to you about what happened?
4015623	eng	Are you sure you don't remember what happened?
4015624	eng	Can any of you tell me what happened?
4015625	eng	My advice to you is to forget about what happened.
4015626	eng	I wish I'd never told Tom about what happened.
4015627	eng	Tom laughed when I told him about what happened.
4015629	eng	It's obvious Tom doesn't want to talk about what happened.
4015630	eng	I think I can explain what happened.
4015631	eng	That's not exactly how it happened.
4015632	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to find out about what had happened.
4015633	eng	Tom was afraid to tell his parents about what had happened.
4015634	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary anything about what had happened.
4015635	eng	Tom said he knew nothing about what had happened.
4015636	eng	Tom was questioned by the police about what had happened.
4015637	eng	This is going to come in very handy.
4015638	eng	This should come in very handy.
4015639	eng	How did you cut your hand?
4015640	eng	How did you hurt your hand?
4015641	eng	The police found gunshot residue on Tom's hands.
4015642	eng	Would you say I was handsome?
4015643	eng	Tom isn't very handsome.
4015644	eng	Do you really think Tom is handsome?
4015645	eng	Tom thinks he's handsome.
4015646	eng	Could you use an extra pair of hands?
4015647	eng	Tom bandaged Mary's hand.
4015648	eng	Tom has three fingers missing on his left hand.
4015649	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to hold his hand.
4015650	eng	Tom allowed Mary to hold his hand.
4015651	eng	Would you lend me a hand?
4015652	eng	Could you hand me the hammer?
4015653	eng	You don't, by any chance, know where I can find a hammer?
4015654	eng	Would you order me a hamburger?
4015655	eng	Both Mary and Alice have very long hair.
4015656	eng	Tom's was the only phone number Mary had.
4015657	eng	It's hard to break a habit.
4015658	eng	Do you recognize that guy?
4015659	eng	What's the matter with you guys?
4015660	eng	What's wrong with you guys?
4015661	eng	Tom is a very intelligent guy.
4015662	eng	Tom is a very creative guy.
4015663	eng	Tom is a creative guy.
4015664	eng	Have you ever shot a gun?
4015665	eng	Why are you carrying a gun?
4015666	eng	Do you still have a gun?
4015667	eng	What did you do with your old guitar?
4015668	eng	Tom traded his old computer for a guitar.
4015669	eng	Maybe Tom is guilty.
4015670	eng	Tom once worked as a tourist guide.
4015671	eng	What Tom needs is guidance.
4015672	eng	Who are the other guests?
4015673	eng	There's a money-back guarantee.
4015674	eng	Are you part of this group?
4015675	eng	Did you just call me an old grouch?
4015676	eng	I burned my arm on the grill.
4015677	eng	It was actually really great.
4015678	eng	Tom was brought up by his grandparents.
4015679	eng	Tom and Mary named their first daughter after Tom's grandmother.
4015680	eng	Do you have grandchildren?
4015681	eng	Tom needs to improve his grades.
4015682	eng	Tom has been in love with Mary since the seventh grade.
4015683	eng	Why doesn't Tom just let us go?
4015684	eng	Have you already decided where you're going to go?
4015685	eng	Where else do I have to go?
4015686	eng	Would you like me to go?
4015687	eng	Do you have someplace to go?
4015688	eng	Is that where you intend to go?
4015689	eng	Where's Tom supposed to go?
4015690	eng	Let me see if Tom is ready to go.
4015691	eng	You can't force me to go.
4015692	eng	Let me show you what I've got.
4015693	eng	What's Tom got that I haven't got?
4015694	eng	Where do you think we should go?
4015695	eng	My eyesight isn't very good.
4015696	eng	My French isn't that good.
4015697	eng	Do you think this milk is still good?
4015698	eng	This pizza is really good.
4015699	eng	This is actually quite good.
4015700	eng	This pizza is really quite good.
4015701	eng	It won't do you much good.
4015702	eng	Do you really think this looks good?
4015703	eng	Well, aren't you going to kiss Tom goodbye?
4015704	eng	Would you say I was good-looking?
4015705	eng	Tom didn't even notice that Mary was gone.
4015706	eng	Does Tom have any idea where Mary might've gone?
4015707	eng	Do you know where Tom might've gone?
4015708	eng	Do you have any idea where Tom might've gone?
4015709	eng	If I hadn't wanted to be there, I wouldn't have gone.
4015710	eng	Nobody knows where Tom has gone.
4015711	eng	How long have they been gone?
4015712	eng	How long do you think Tom will be gone?
4015713	eng	How long do you think you'll be gone?
4015714	eng	How well do you play golf?
4015715	eng	Can you teach me how to play golf?
4015716	eng	All right, people, let's go.
4015717	eng	How did your meeting with your lawyer go?
4015718	eng	Where on earth do you think you're going?
4015719	eng	Where do you two think you're going?
4015720	eng	Why can't you watch where you're going?
4015721	eng	Where exactly are you going?
4015722	eng	Could you at least tell me where we're going?
4015723	eng	Do you have any idea where we're going?
4015724	eng	Where exactly are we going?
4015725	eng	Exactly where are we going?
4015726	eng	Did Tom say where he was going?
4015727	eng	Where's the next train going?
4015728	eng	How's your summer going?
4015729	eng	Were you able to talk Tom out of going?
4015730	eng	I couldn't talk Tom out of going.
4015731	eng	How are the negotiations going?
4015732	eng	Do you still want know why I'm going?
4015733	eng	All right, let's get going.
4015734	eng	I guess I'll be going.
4015735	eng	Perhaps I should be going.
4015736	eng	Where did the other girls go?
4015737	eng	Where did the other girl go?
4015738	eng	Do you know any place we can go?
4015739	eng	I guess I'd better go.
4015740	eng	Where do the batteries go?
4015741	eng	How did your doctor's appointment go?
4015742	eng	Put on your gloves.
4015743	eng	Do you have a magnifying glass?
4015744	eng	Can I borrow your glasses?
4015745	eng	Could you remove your glasses?
4015746	eng	Do we have enough glasses?
4015747	eng	Do you recognize that girl?
4015748	eng	Are you really Tom's girlfriend?
4015749	eng	Tom has only had one girlfriend.
4015750	eng	Tom has only ever had one girlfriend.
4015752	eng	Tom seems to have a new girlfriend.
4015753	eng	Tom told Mary that he had a new girlfriend.
4015754	eng	Tom asked Mary to pretend to be his girlfriend.
4015755	eng	Have you ever had a girlfriend?
4015756	eng	Tom's parents think Tom is still too young to have a girlfriend.
4015757	eng	Are you sure it was a ghost?
4015758	eng	What does the winner get?
4015759	eng	How hot is it going to get?
4015760	eng	How cold is it going to get?
4015761	eng	What do you think you're going to get?
4015762	eng	That shouldn't be too hard to get.
4015763	eng	How hot will it get?
4015764	eng	How cold will it get?
4015765	eng	Tom hid the gun under a bunch of oily rags in his garage.
4015766	eng	All Tom does is play video games.
4015767	eng	How much time do you spend playing games?
4015768	eng	You should quit gambling.
4015769	eng	Are you afraid of the future?
4015770	eng	What's something you plan to do in the near future?
4015771	eng	Why should Tom have all the fun?
4015772	eng	Come on, let's have some fun.
4015773	eng	Wasn't that a lot of fun?
4015774	eng	That looks like a lot of fun.
4015776	eng	This should be a lot of fun.
4015777	eng	It's actually kind of fun.
4015778	eng	This is no longer funny.
4015779	eng	This really isn't funny.
4015780	eng	Is this supposed to be funny?
4015781	eng	That doesn't sound like much fun.
4015782	eng	That sound like fun.
4015783	eng	Everybody seems to be having fun.
4015784	eng	What exactly do you do for fun?
4015785	eng	What do you two do for fun?
4015786	eng	Was that supposed to be fun?
4015787	eng	It's not supposed to be fun.
4015789	eng	There's a BMW parked out front.
4015790	eng	Where's all the money coming from?
4015791	eng	Where did the painting come from?
4015792	eng	Do you have any idea where that came from?
4015793	eng	What are you running away from?
4015794	eng	Tom and Mary mailed wedding invitations to all of their friends.

4015796	eng	Does Tom have many friends?
4015797	eng	Tom is taller than any of his friends.
4015798	eng	How long have we been friends?
4015799	eng	I told Tom I just want to be friends.
4015800	eng	Everyone here is friendly.
4015801	eng	Tom isn't my boyfriend. He's just a friend.
4015802	eng	There's more beer in the fridge.
4015803	eng	Would you like to improve your French?
4015804	eng	How well do you understand French?
4015805	eng	Can Tom understand French?
4015806	eng	Tom wished he could understand French.
4015807	eng	Tom convinced Mary to start studying French.
4015808	eng	Tom thought Mary was wasting her time studying French.
4015809	eng	I study French.
4015810	eng	How long have you studied French?
4015811	eng	Did you know Tom is pretty good at speaking French?
4015812	eng	How well do you speak French?
4015813	eng	Are you sure Tom can speak French?
4015814	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary he couldn't speak French.
4015815	eng	You're not the only one here who can't speak French.
4015816	eng	I had no idea Tom knew how to speak French.
4015817	eng	It's very important for our employees to be able to speak French.
4015818	eng	Tom is the only person I personally know who can speak French.
4015819	eng	What are some things I can do to improve my French?
4015820	eng	Does Tom talk to you in French?
4015821	eng	I think that song sounds better in French.
4015822	eng	I didn't think Tom knew any French.
4015823	eng	Tom says that he's willing to make you one for free.
4015824	eng	These are very fragile.
4015825	eng	Where was the knife found?
4015826	eng	Who do you really work for?

4015859	eng	There's no need to be so formal.
4015860	eng	Who were they looking for?
4015861	eng	What were you looking for?
4015862	eng	Well, what are you looking for?
4015863	eng	What kind of shoes are you looking for?
4015864	eng	What on earth are you looking for?
4015865	eng	What was Tom looking for?
4015866	eng	Were you able to find what you were looking for?

4015875	eng	What are you going to use it for?
4015876	eng	What do you think this is for?
4015877	eng	It's not really what I was hoping for.
4015878	eng	What did you call me in here for?
4015879	eng	What are you shaking your head for?
4015880	eng	What does Tom need a gun for?
4015881	eng	What are the flowers for?
4015882	eng	What are we fighting for?
4015883	eng	This could take forever.
4015884	eng	What do you need a doctor for?
4015885	eng	What's the champagne for?
4015886	eng	Is Tom being properly cared for?
4015887	eng	Did you get what you asked for?
4015888	eng	Do you have what I asked for?
4015889	eng	Here's what you asked for.
4015890	eng	Is that really too much to ask for?
4015891	eng	What more could we ask for?
4015892	eng	What more could I ask for?
4015893	eng	What am I being arrested for?
4015894	eng	What are you people sitting around for?
4015895	eng	What's Tom hanging around for?
4015896	eng	What are you standing around for?
4015897	eng	What are you all standing around for?
4015898	eng	What are we standing around for?
4015899	eng	What are you following me around for?
4015900	eng	What are you apologizing for?
4015901	eng	Who do you think you're fooling?
4015902	eng	This plan is fool-proof.
4015903	eng	How long can we last without food?
4015904	eng	How long can we go without food?
4015905	eng	What's wrong with the food?
4015906	eng	Should I order you some food?
4015907	eng	Would you care for some food?
4015908	eng	How often do you eat junk food?
4015909	eng	Tom says he's gotten used to eating hospital food.
4015910	eng	Are you sure we have enough food?
4015911	eng	There's not enough food.
4015912	eng	Make sure we're not being followed.
4015913	eng	Make sure you aren't being followed.
4015914	eng	It might've been Tom who sent you these flowers.
4015915	eng	Tom didn't water the flowers.
4015916	eng	Why did Tom send Mary flowers?
4015917	eng	These are beautiful flowers.
4015918	eng	My office is on the third floor.
4015919	eng	Why is that on the floor?
4015920	eng	Tom pointed at the coin on the floor.
4015921	eng	There's blood on the floor.
4015922	eng	It's not that long a flight.
4015923	eng	Why is that light flashing?
4015924	eng	Is there anything you can't fix?
4015925	eng	Tom hit the wall with his fist.
4015926	eng	Dolphins aren't fish.
4015927	eng	I never do anything without asking Tom first.
4015928	eng	We need to let the paint dry first.
4015929	eng	Go out and get some more firewood.
4015930	eng	Could you go get some wood for the fire?
4015931	eng	Did Tom say why he was fired?
4015932	eng	That's why Tom was fired.
4015933	eng	Are you trying to get me fired?
4015934	eng	If Tom messes up again, he's going to get fired.
4015935	eng	I think I'm going to get fired.
4015936	eng	Please allow me to finish.
4015937	eng	Please be quiet and let me finish.
4015938	eng	How soon can you have the report finished?
4015939	eng	It's still not finished.
4015940	eng	When will the repair be finished?
4015941	eng	This is going to work out fine.
4015942	eng	What exactly did you find?
4015943	eng	Let me know what you find.
4015944	eng	Just what do you expect to find?
4015945	eng	What exactly are we trying to find?
4015946	eng	Tom is studying hard for his finals.
4015947	eng	Maybe Tom is afraid to fight.
4015948	eng	It's time to stop fighting.
4015949	eng	Would the two of you quit fighting?
4015950	eng	Have you two been fighting?
4015951	eng	Are you two having a fight?
4015952	eng	It wasn't really a fight.
4015953	eng	It wasn't much of a fight.
4015954	eng	It took three hours for us to paint the fence.
4015955	eng	Look, I know how you feel.
4015956	eng	Tom didn't even seem to realize he'd hurt Mary's feelings.
4015957	eng	Do I look as bad as I feel?
4015958	eng	Can I ask a small personal favor?
4015959	eng	Could you do me one favor?
4015960	eng	It might not have been Tom's fault.
4015961	eng	It might not be Tom's fault.
4015962	eng	Why can't you be more like your father?
4015963	eng	Tom is almost as old as my father.
4015964	eng	How were you able to find Tom so fast?
4015965	eng	It's actually kind of fascinating.
4015966	tur	Bunu bize verecek misin?
4015967	eng	What have you found out so far?
4015968	eng	You've done a good job so far.
4015969	eng	Tom isn't a huge football fan.
4015970	eng	Would you rather be rich or famous?
4015971	eng	How often do you visit your family?
4015972	eng	Where's the rest of your family?
4015973	eng	You seem to know a lot about Tom and his family.
4015974	eng	That name sounds familiar.
4015975	eng	Why does that name sound familiar?
4015976	eng	Why does that man look so familiar?
4015977	eng	What makes you so sure it's not a fake?
4015978	eng	What makes you think it's a fake?
4015979	eng	Perhaps it's a fake.
4015980	eng	Maybe it's a fake.
4015981	eng	They blamed Tom for the failure.
4015982	eng	What caused the power failure?
4015983	eng	Have you ever been punched in the face?
4015984	eng	Tom leaned back and closed his eyes.
4015985	eng	There was a loud explosion.
4015986	eng	There's no time for explanations.
4015987	eng	What's the most logical explanation?
4015988	eng	It's the only logical explanation.
4015989	eng	There's a better explanation.
4015990	eng	It's not easy to explain.
4015991	eng	It's very difficult to explain.
4015992	eng	It'll be very difficult to explain.
4015993	eng	It would take all that long to explain.
4015994	eng	It'll take too long to explain.
4015995	eng	It would take too long to explain.
4015996	eng	Please give me a minute to explain.
4015997	eng	It's impossible to explain.
4015998	eng	Tom didn't give Mary a chance to explain.
4015999	eng	Tom didn't even give Mary a chance to explain.
4016000	eng	Actually, it's hard to explain.
4016001	eng	It's kind of hard to explain.
4016002	eng	It was a terrific experience.
4016003	eng	It was a remarkable experience.
4016004	eng	It just got too expensive.
4016005	eng	It's really not that expensive.
4016006	eng	There'll be a lot of expenses.
4016007	eng	What else could we expect?
4016008	eng	Do you understand what's expected?
4016009	eng	Tom did even better than we expected.
4016010	eng	This might take a lot more time than we expected.
4016011	eng	This may take more time than we expected.
4016012	eng	Did you understand what was expected?
4016013	eng	That took much longer than I expected.
4016014	eng	That cost a lot more than I expected.
4016015	eng	There are several exits.
4016016	eng	Do you get enough exercise?
4016017	eng	Have you been getting enough exercise?
4016018	eng	When will the prisoners be executed?
4016019	eng	I'm sick of your excuses.
4016020	eng	It's really kind of exciting.
4016021	eng	What did you mean by that exactly?
4016022	eng	What is it that you saw exactly?
4016023	eng	What does that mean exactly?
4016024	eng	What's that mean exactly?
4016025	eng	What is Tom's job exactly?
4016026	eng	What business are you in exactly?
4016027	eng	What are you looking for exactly?
4016028	eng	What are we looking for exactly?
4016029	eng	What are you asking us to do exactly?
4016030	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was an ex-con?
4016031	eng	There was broken glass everywhere.
4016032	eng	They made Tom tell them everything.
4016033	eng	Why shouldn't we take everything?
4016034	eng	There's a reason for everything.
4016035	eng	This could change everything.
4016036	eng	There's plenty for everyone.
4016037	eng	Thanks for calling everyone.
4016038	eng	What's the matter with everybody?
4016039	eng	Why is this so important to everybody?
4016040	eng	Have you met everybody?
4016041	eng	This is the best party ever.
4016042	eng	Everybody dies eventually.
4016043	eng	It was a wonderful evening.
4016044	eng	Have you made plans for dinner this evening?
4016045	eng	Would you have dinner with me this evening?
4016046	eng	Tom is coming to dinner this evening.
4016047	eng	Tom and Mary are planning on going to a movie together on Friday evening.
4016048	eng	Tom eats out almost every evening.
4016049	eng	There's still time to evacuate.
4016050	eng	Tom inherited his uncle's estate.
4016051	eng	Were you trying to escape?
4016052	eng	How did you manage to escape?
4016053	eng	Tom tried to distract the police so Mary could escape.
4016054	eng	There's a back entrance.
4016055	eng	Are you sure you're going to be warm enough?
4016056	eng	Maybe that's not enough.
4016057	eng	Tom hasn't been eating enough.
4016058	eng	Is three hundred dollars enough?
4016059	eng	That should've been enough.
4016060	eng	Are you sure one bottle of wine is going to be enough?
4016061	eng	Do you think three hours will be enough?
4016062	eng	Tom wants to be an electrical engineer.
4016063	eng	Why do you have so many enemies?
4016064	eng	It's time for this to end.
4016065	eng	Do you remember how this movie ends?
4016066	eng	It's kind of an emergency.
4016067	eng	It's kind of embarrassing.
4016068	eng	Perhaps you should go elsewhere.
4016069	eng	Perhaps we could talk about this somewhere else.
4016070	eng	Perhaps you should go somewhere else.
4016071	eng	Could we please talk about something else?
4016072	eng	Was Tom carrying anything else?
4016073	eng	Did you see anything else?
4016074	eng	Did you find anything else?
4016075	eng	Let me know if you find anything else.
4016076	eng	Have you been dating anyone else?
4016077	eng	Tom is smarter than anyone else.
4016078	eng	What's wrong with the elevator?
4016079	eng	Water conducts of electricity.
4016080	eng	Why does water conduct electricity?
4016081	eng	Does water conduct electricity?
4016082	eng	Would you care to elaborate?
4016083	eng	That's not going to work either.
4016084	eng	Tom joined the army when he was eighteen.
4016085	eng	What else did you eat?
4016086	eng	Are you sure you got enough to eat?
4016087	eng	What did Tom say he wanted to eat?
4016088	eng	Tom stopped talking and began to eat.
4016089	eng	Tom and the others are already eating.
4016090	eng	Wasn't that a little too easy?
4016091	eng	This is almost too easy.
4016092	eng	It might not be that easy.
4016093	eng	That might not be so easy.
4016094	eng	It hasn't always been easy.
4016095	eng	It couldn't have been easy.
4016096	eng	This should be easy.
4016097	eng	Tom isn't the kind of person who loses his temper easily.
4016098	eng	Does it ever get easier?
4016099	eng	That doesn't make it any easier.
4016100	eng	That felt like an earthquake.
4016101	eng	Where's your other earring?
4016102	eng	Tom makes it a rule to get up early.
4016103	eng	Tom goes to bed early and gets up early.
4016104	eng	What are you doing back so early?
4016105	eng	What are you doing home so early?
4016106	eng	Aren't you a little early?
4016107	eng	Tom must've left early.
4016108	eng	Tom was tired, so he went to bed early.
4016109	eng	My mother has never seen me drunk.
4016110	eng	Never argue with a drunk.
4016111	eng	Tom and Mary took turns driving.
4016112	eng	Tom and Mary took turns with the driving.
4016113	eng	Can Tom drive?
4016114	eng	Would you like me to drive?
4016115	eng	Tom didn't want to drive.
4016116	eng	Tom asked me if I would like to drive.
4016117	eng	Tom told me that he enjoyed the drive.
4016118	eng	Who's the better driver?
4016119	eng	Did I put too much rum in your drink?
4016120	eng	How often do you drink?
4016121	eng	What else did you drink?
4016122	eng	Is Tom old enough to drink?
4016123	eng	Haven't you had too much to drink?
4016124	eng	Would it be possible for me to get something to drink?
4016125	eng	Would you get me something to drink?
4016126	eng	Is this water OK to drink?
4016127	eng	Why don't I get us some drinks?
4016128	eng	Let me get us some more drinks.
4016129	eng	I don't drink carbonated drinks.
4016130	eng	Tom told me that he doesn't like carbonated drinks.
4016131	eng	Are you sure I can't get you another drink?
4016132	eng	Let me get you another drink.
4016133	eng	Aren't you going to offer me a drink?
4016134	eng	Come on, let's get a drink.
4016135	eng	Come on, let's go get a drink.
4016136	eng	What's wrong with the way I dress?
4016137	eng	Have you been having bad dreams?
4016138	eng	Are you sure it wasn't just a dream?
4016139	eng	Tom rummaged through the drawer.
4016140	eng	What else is in that drawer?
4016141	eng	Did you go through my drawers?
4016142	eng	Well, what else could you do?
4016143	eng	What precisely did you do?
4016144	eng	What's the fastest way to get downtown?
4016145	eng	Are you writing this down?
4016146	eng	Tom came back downstairs.
4016147	eng	Things have slowed down.
4016148	eng	Would you please slow down?
4016149	eng	All right, let's settle down.
4016150	eng	How did you track me down?
4016151	eng	Perhaps you should lie down.
4016152	eng	Maybe you should lie down.
4016153	eng	The party is dying down.
4016154	eng	The fire is dying down.
4016155	eng	Why not break the door down?
4016156	eng	Things have calmed down.
4016157	eng	Could you please calm down?
4016158	eng	Tom was the one who told Mary that her house had burned down.
4016159	eng	Maybe Tom's car broke down.
4016160	eng	What good do you think that will do?
4016161	eng	Is there anything you don't know how to do?
4016162	eng	What are they asking you to do?
4016163	eng	Are you sure this is what you want to do?
4016165	eng	Well, what do you want to do?
4016166	eng	What do you think Tom ought to do?
4016167	eng	What do you think we ought to do?
4016168	eng	Have you figured out what to do?
4016169	eng	Do you remember what to do?
4016170	eng	Well, what did you expect us to do?
4016171	eng	What did you expect us to do?
4016172	eng	What exactly are you asking us to do?
4016173	eng	What exactly do you plan to do?

4016180	eng	What else are they going to do?
4016181	eng	What exactly are you going to do?
4016182	eng	What do you think I'm going to do?
4016183	eng	What on earth are we going to do?
4016184	eng	What do you think you're going to do?
4016185	eng	What's the first thing you're going to do?
4016186	eng	Well, what am I going to do?
4016187	eng	What else am I going to do?
4016188	eng	Are you sure that's the best thing to do?
4016189	eng	Is this the right thing to do?
4016190	eng	What do you think is the right thing to do?
4016191	eng	What's the right thing to do?
4016192	eng	What else do we have to do?
4016193	eng	Isn't that what you're supposed to do?
4016194	eng	What else is there to do?
4016195	eng	Is this what you want me to do?
4016196	eng	Well, what do you want me to do?
4016197	eng	What more do you want me to do?
4016198	eng	What exactly do you expect me to do?
4016199	eng	What are you asking me to do?
4016200	eng	What is it you're asking me to do?
4016201	eng	Was there anything else you wanted me to do?
4016202	eng	What exactly do you need me to do?
4016203	eng	Is there anything you need me to do?
4016204	eng	What did Tom say he wanted to do?
4016205	eng	What's that supposed to do?
4016206	eng	What was Tom supposed to do?
4016207	eng	What's Tom supposed to do?
4016208	eng	What's that thing supposed to do?
4016209	eng	What else were we supposed to do?
4016210	eng	Are you sure you did everything you were supposed to do?
4016211	eng	Well, what was I supposed to do?
4016212	eng	What else am I supposed to do?
4016213	eng	What else do we need to do?
4016214	eng	Is that what you've decided to do?
4016215	eng	What was the last really difficult thing you had to do?
4016216	eng	Was that really something we had to do?
4016217	eng	Just do what I ask you to do.
4016218	eng	Tom has finally accomplished what he set out to do.
4016219	eng	I wonder what Tom will want to do.
4016220	eng	That wouldn't be too difficult to do.
4016221	eng	There's still so much left to do.
4016222	eng	We have so much left to do.
4016223	eng	Tom admitted he didn't know what to do.
4016224	eng	It's unlikely Tom will know what to do.
4016225	eng	I want to get Tom to tell us what to do.
4016226	eng	Tom said he wasn't sure what to do.
4016227	eng	It wouldn't be all that difficult for us to do what Tom wants us to do.
4016228	eng	It's on my list of things to do.
4016229	eng	Tom knew that he couldn't do what Mary was asking him to do.

4016234	eng	There's still so much to do.
4016235	eng	We have so much to do.
4016236	eng	There's just too much to do.
4016237	eng	Tom tried to tell Mary what he was planning to do.
4016238	eng	That was a very risky thing to do.
4016239	eng	That was a risky thing to do.
4016240	eng	That's a risky thing to do.
4016241	eng	It's just the right thing to do.
4016242	eng	It just seems like the right thing to do.
4016243	eng	It seems like the right thing to do.
4016244	eng	It seems like the obvious thing to do.
4016245	eng	It seemed like the only rational thing to do.
4016246	eng	That was a very brave thing to do.
4016247	eng	It was a terrible thing to do.
4016248	eng	That wasn't a very nice thing to do.
4016249	eng	That was a really dumb thing to do.
4016250	eng	That was a dumb thing to do.
4016251	eng	There wasn't much else to do.
4016252	eng	I couldn't figure out what Tom wanted me to do.
4016253	eng	This shouldn't be very hard to do.
4016254	eng	This shouldn't be all that hard to do.
4016255	eng	This shouldn't be so hard to do.
4016256	eng	This shouldn't be too hard to do.

4016258	eng	That was what Tom wanted to do.
4016259	eng	That was what Tom said he wanted to do.
4016260	eng	I forgot to tell Tom what he was supposed to do.
4016261	eng	It's up to Tom to make sure Mary does what she's supposed to do.
4016262	eng	I have no idea what we're supposed to do.
4016263	eng	There wasn't enough time to do everything that we needed to do.
4016264	eng	It's one of the most difficult things I've ever had to do.
4016265	eng	What do you think Tom should do?
4016266	eng	Well, what do you think we should do?
4016267	eng	Do you have any idea what I should do?
4016268	eng	That's what Tom should do.
4016269	eng	Tom said he wasn't sure what he should do.
4016270	eng	Tom knew that Mary would never do what she said she'd do.
4016271	eng	What more could we possibly do?
4016272	eng	It's what rich people do.
4016273	eng	Why didn't you answer the door?
4016274	eng	Why not just knock on the door?
4016275	eng	Would you open the door?
4016276	eng	Shouldn't we lock the door?
4016277	eng	Could you close the door?
4016278	eng	Are you sure you locked the door?
4016279	eng	There's a padlock on the door.
4016280	eng	There's no lock on the door.
4016281	eng	Tom didn't even bother knocking on the door.
4016282	eng	Somebody knocked on the door.
4016283	eng	Somebody forgot to lock the door.
4016284	eng	Come in and lock the door.
4016285	eng	Thanks for opening the door.
4016286	eng	Get away from that door.
4016287	eng	What would you normally do?
4016288	eng	Do you have any idea what you've done?
4016289	eng	What makes you think you're done?
4016290	eng	Did you get any work done?
4016291	eng	How quickly can we get that done?
4016292	eng	Is this really how it's done?
4016293	eng	All right, what's done is done.
4016294	eng	What am I supposed to have done?
4016295	eng	What would Tom have done?
4016296	eng	What's the craziest thing you've ever done?
4016297	eng	There's a lot of work left to be done.
4016298	eng	Only Tom can tell us what needs to be done.
4016299	eng	Do what needs to be done.
4016300	eng	There's work to be done.
4016301	eng	There's still work to be done.
4016302	eng	There's a lot of work to be done.
4016303	eng	There wasn't enough time to do everything that needed to be done.

4016309	eng	Tom is carrying a bag containing a million dollars.
4016310	eng	Tom asked Mary to lend him three hundred dollars.
4016311	eng	That probably cost less than a dollar.
4016312	eng	What possible harm could it do?
4016313	eng	What precisely are you doing?
4016314	eng	What, may I ask, are you doing?
4016315	eng	What exactly are we doing?
4016316	eng	Are you sure that's what Tom was doing?
4016317	eng	Aren't you even going to ask me what I was doing?
4016318	eng	Tom went outside to see what Mary was doing.
4016319	eng	Perhaps we should find out what Tom's doing.
4016320	eng	What exactly was Tom doing?
4016321	eng	What were you planning on doing?
4016322	eng	What are the other men doing?
4016323	eng	Why not do the same thing Tom is doing?
4016324	eng	Do you think I don't know what I'm doing?
4016325	eng	What does it look like I'm doing?
4016326	eng	It's obvious that Tom knows what he's doing.
4016327	eng	I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
4016328	eng	What are some things you enjoy doing?
4016329	eng	What exactly will you be doing?
4016330	eng	Are you sure we're doing what we're supposed to be doing?
4016331	eng	What exactly will Tom be doing?
4016332	eng	What else should we be doing?
4016333	tur	Bunu bana verecek misin?
4016334	eng	Isn't that what we should be doing?
4016335	eng	What would you rather I be doing?
4016336	eng	Tom doesn't know as many people here as I do.
4016337	eng	I get paid more than most people here do.
4016338	eng	Tom has already done what he said he'd do.
4016339	eng	When was the last time you fed your dog?
4016340	eng	Could you help me find my dog?

4016351	eng	Maybe Tom should go to the doctor.
4016352	eng	Are you a real doctor?
4016353	eng	When was the last time you saw a doctor?
4016354	eng	Why didn't you call a doctor?
4016355	eng	Do you need to see a doctor?
4016356	eng	Aren't you a little young to be a doctor?
4016357	eng	My parents expect me to become a doctor.
4016358	eng	Perhaps you should see a doctor.
4016359	eng	What's the worst they could do?
4016360	eng	Is that the best you could do?
4016361	eng	There wasn't much else we could do.

4016405	eng	That shouldn't be too difficult.
4016406	eng	It really wasn't that difficult.

4016408	eng	I don't think it'll be all that difficult.
4016409	eng	That shouldn't be so difficult.
4016410	eng	That might be a little difficult.
4016411	eng	That shouldn't be difficult.
4016412	eng	That may prove to be difficult.
4016413	eng	Do I really seem that different?
4016414	eng	Did you expect something different?
4016415	eng	Why is everything different?
4016416	eng	It's always a little bit different.
4016417	eng	Do you feel any different?
4016418	eng	There are minor differences.
4016419	eng	That wouldn't make much difference.
4016420	eng	Does it make any difference?
4016421	eng	Why would that make any difference?
4016422	eng	That wouldn't make any difference.

4016444	eng	Tom made me swear not to tell Mary about what he did.
4016445	eng	Tom wished he hadn't done what he did.

4016456	eng	How far is it to our destination?
4016457	eng	Would you like to order dessert?
4016458	eng	Are you ready for dessert?
4016459	eng	Someone put an envelope on your desk.
4016460	eng	Help me move this desk.
4016461	eng	It's difficult to describe.
4016462	eng	How often do you go to the dentist?
4016463	eng	Have you read my list of demands?
4016464	eng	Tom tasted the soup and said it was delicious.
4016465	eng	This mango is delicious.
4016466	eng	I'm dehydrated.

4016485	eng	It's not open for debate.
4016486	eng	What was the cause of death?
4016487	eng	All right, here's the deal.
4016488	eng	That wasn't part of the deal.
4016489	eng	That sounds like a very good deal.
4016490	eng	That sounds like a good deal.
4016491	eng	What's it like to be deaf?

4016586	eng	Did Tom ever regain consciousness?
4016587	eng	Do you really believe there's a connection?
4016588	eng	There was a moment of confusion.
4016589	eng	Tom was surprised and a little confused.

4016605	eng	Is that supposed to be a compliment?
4016606	eng	It shouldn't be too complicated.
4016607	eng	It's kind of complicated.
4016608	eng	Tom hardly ever complains.

4017013	eng	Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

4017023	eng	Have you ever been shot at before?
4017024	eng	It's the same as before.
4017025	eng	I only had a couple beers.
4017026	eng	Is there any more beer?
4017027	eng	Are you sure we have enough beer?
4017028	eng	Everyone else is drinking beer.
4017029	eng	Do you have any idea how lucky you've been?
4017030	eng	How long do you think it's been?
4017031	eng	Do you have any idea where I've been?
4017032	eng	Who else might it have been?
4017033	eng	What else could it have been?
4017034	eng	Tom lied about where he had been.
4017035	eng	It's the same as it's always been.
4017036	eng	Perhaps you should go to bed.
4017037	eng	Maybe you should go to bed.
4017038	eng	Aren't you up past your bedtime?
4017039	eng	There's no room under the bed.
4017040	eng	What color are you going to paint Tom's bedroom?
4017041	eng	Tom hid the knife he'd killed Mary with in John's bedroom.
4017042	eng	Tom undressed and got into bed.
4017043	eng	Shouldn't you still be in bed?
4017044	eng	What do you think this could be?
4017045	eng	What do you suppose this could be?
4017046	eng	Do you have any idea where Tom could be?

4017049	eng	How badly was Tom beaten?
4017050	eng	Are you trying to grow a beard?
4017051	eng	How long have you had a beard?
4017052	eng	Guess what I found on the beach.
4017053	eng	Tom asked Mary to clean the bathroom.
4017054	eng	Where's the nearest bathroom?
4017055	eng	That's not my baseball bat.
4017056	eng	What else was in the basket?
4017057	eng	I know that Tom likes basketball.
4017058	eng	What do you expect to find in Tom's basement?
4017059	eng	When did you start liking baseball?
4017060	eng	Tom wasn't interested in baseball.
4017061	eng	All right, let's play some ball.
4017062	eng	Tom almost lost his balance.
4017063	eng	Maybe Tom didn't use the right kind of bait.
4017064	eng	What are you using for bait?
4017065	eng	Please let me carry your bag.
4017066	eng	It looks like a shopping bag.
4017067	eng	Were all of these in the same bag?
4017068	eng	It's really not too bad.
4017069	eng	Is it really that bad?
4017070	eng	It's really not that bad.
4017071	eng	Maybe it's not that bad.
4017072	eng	It couldn't have been that bad.
4017073	eng	This place isn't so bad.
4017074	eng	Are you saying I smell bad?
4017075	eng	Why does everyone want one of those so badly?
4017076	eng	How did you hurt your back?
4017077	eng	Does that chair hurt your back?
4017078	eng	We'll call you back.
4017079	eng	How will I find my way back?
4017080	eng	Are you sure Tom is on his way back?
4017081	eng	Maybe we should turn back.
4017082	eng	Could you put a little sunscreen on my back?
4017083	eng	Why would I want my money back?
4017084	eng	Is it too late to get my money back?
4017085	eng	Thanks for calling me back.
4017086	eng	Are you ready to go back?
4017087	eng	I'll stay with Tom until you get back.
4017088	eng	Why isn't Tom fighting back?
4017089	eng	When's Tom expected back?
4017090	eng	Are you sure Tom is coming back?
4017091	eng	Thanks for calling back.
4017092	eng	Wait for me. I'll be back.
4017093	eng	Tom spoke quietly so he wouldn't wake the baby.
4017094	eng	My parents died when I was a baby.
4017095	eng	This stuff tastes awful.
4017096	eng	Tom looked after our dog while we were away.
4017097	eng	Tom looked after my dog while I was away.
4017098	eng	It's not too late to walk away.

4017100	eng	Are you sure you want to throw that away?
4017101	eng	Are you going to throw that away?
4017102	eng	Everyone needs to get out of here right away.
4017103	eng	It doesn't have to be done right away.
4017104	eng	It's about three meters away.
4017105	eng	Did Tom say how long he'd be away?
4017106	eng	How long have you been awake?
4017107	eng	It's probably still available.

4017115	eng	Is it still up in the attic?
4017116	eng	May I have your attention?
4017117	eng	Let me have your attention.
4017118	eng	Haven't you been paying attention?

4017124	eng	What are you two staring at?
4017125	eng	What are you all looking at?
4017126	eng	Well, what are you good at?
4017127	eng	What exactly are you getting at?
4017128	eng	That's a reasonable assumption.
4017129	eng	It seemed like a reasonable assumption.
4017130	eng	Do any of you need medical assistance?
4017131	eng	The children are upstairs asleep.
4017132	eng	Wake me up when you get home if I'm asleep.
4017133	eng	Try not to fall asleep.
4017134	eng	Are you sure everyone's already asleep?
4017135	eng	It's not likely Tom will do what we ask.
4017136	eng	What kind of questions will they ask?
4017137	eng	Why doesn't Tom just do what we've asked?
4017138	eng	Why didn't you do what we asked?
4017139	eng	This is a fascinating article.
4017140	eng	Was Tom here when you arrived?

4017142	eng	Are you sure it's not the other way around?

4017163	eng	Are you sure we don't need an appointment?
4017164	eng	Tom was chosen from among 300 applicants.
4017165	eng	That sounds really appealing.
4017166	eng	Look, I owe you an apology.
4017167	eng	There's no need for an apology.
4017168	eng	Have you called Tom to apologize?
4017169	eng	Tom is too stubborn to apologize.
4017170	eng	Please accept our apologies.
4017171	eng	It's too late for apologies.
4017172	eng	What else did you find in Tom's apartment?
4017173	eng	How old are you anyway?
4017174	eng	What do you guys want anyway?
4017175	eng	What was your plan anyway?
4017176	eng	It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
4017177	eng	Why does it matter anyway?
4017178	eng	What's Tom doing here anyway?
4017179	eng	Why do I have to be here anyway?
4017180	eng	What are you guys looking for anyway?
4017181	eng	What are we looking for anyway?
4017182	eng	It wouldn't make any difference anyway.
4017183	eng	What are you guys talking about anyway?
4017184	eng	Are you sure I can't get you anything?
4017185	eng	Tom told me not to tell you anything.
4017186	eng	Do you need help with anything?
4017187	eng	Can I help with anything?
4017188	eng	How would that solve anything?

4017191	eng	Why didn't you ever say anything?
4017192	eng	Are you sure you don't want me to say anything?
4017193	eng	Tom was too scared to say anything.
4017194	eng	Perhaps I shouldn't have said anything.
4017195	eng	Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
4017196	eng	Are you sure you don't remember anything?
4017197	eng	Make sure we haven't overlooked anything.
4017198	eng	Please call if you find out anything.
4017199	eng	Call if you need anything.
4017200	eng	Did you bring me anything?
4017201	eng	Tom wished he hadn't told Mary anything.
4017202	eng	Would either of you like anything?
4017203	eng	This isn't helping anything.
4017204	eng	Are you sure you didn't forget anything?
4017205	eng	Let me know if you find anything.
4017206	eng	Are you just going to sit here and not do anything?
4017207	eng	Do you need me to do anything?
4017208	eng	How does that change anything?
4017209	eng	Did Tom seem upset about anything?
4017210	eng	Have you discussed this with anyone?
4017211	eng	It's not easy for Tom to trust anyone.
4017212	eng	Tom made me swear not to tell anyone.
4017213	eng	Does Tom seem like he's afraid of anyone?
4017214	eng	Tom's bruises are barely visible anymore.
4017215	eng	It's possible Tom isn't there anymore.
4017216	eng	It won't be necessary to do that anymore.
4017217	eng	Tom told Mary he didn't want her to do that anymore.
4017218	eng	That's not really necessary anymore.
4017219	eng	Please just don't hurt me anymore.

4017227	eng	This isn't funny anymore.
4017228	eng	It's just not fun anymore.
4017229	eng	Tom didn't want to study French anymore.
4017230	eng	Tom isn't my boyfriend anymore.
4017231	eng	That's not funny at all anymore.
4017232	eng	Have you ever said "I love you" to anybody?
4017233	eng	Have you ever shot anybody?
4017234	eng	Have you ever killed anybody?
4017235	eng	Tom advised Mary not to borrow money from anybody.
4017236	eng	Do you really think that you're fooling anybody?
4017237	eng	There's no other answer.
4017238	eng	These are questions that I can't answer.
4017239	eng	Would you say I was annoying?
4017240	eng	Did you hear the announcement?
4017241	eng	Did you have any stuffed animals?
4017242	eng	Tom didn't seem angry.

4017244	eng	Are you as hungry as I am?
4017245	eng	Are you as bored as I am?
4017246	eng	What kind of guy do you think I am?
4017247	eng	Tom is a much better singer than I am.
4017248	eng	Please don't let anyone know where I am.
4017249	eng	Please don't tell Tom where I am.
4017250	eng	Why didn't you call an ambulance?
4017251	eng	Did you call an ambulance?
4017252	eng	Have you already called an ambulance?
4017253	eng	It's better than the alternative.
4017254	eng	There are no other alternatives.
4017255	eng	There's another alternative.
4017256	eng	Shouldn't you be at work already?
4017257	eng	Shouldn't you be at school already?
4017258	eng	It may be too late already.
4017259	eng	Haven't you done enough already?
4017260	eng	Are you two not getting along?
4017261	eng	How are the negotiations coming along?
4017262	eng	How are things coming along?
4017263	eng	Would you mind coming along?
4017264	eng	Have you been here all along?
4017265	eng	I'll never leave you alone.
4017266	eng	Are you sure you want to be left alone?
4017267	eng	Tom was found dead in the alley.
4017268	eng	Are you able to help us at all?
4017269	eng	I don't trust Tom at all.
4017270	eng	It isn't unusual at all.
4017271	eng	Tom can't speak any French at all.
4017272	eng	It doesn't make any difference at all.
4017273	eng	This doesn't look good at all.
4017274	eng	It's not complicated at all.
4017275	eng	It isn't complicated at all.
4017276	eng	Are your grandparents still alive?

4017278	eng	Do you really think Tom might still be alive?

4017281	eng	Tom had never seen a moose until he moved to Alaska.
4017282	eng	How far are we from the airport?
4017283	eng	I forgot to tell Tom who was going to pick him up at the airport.
4017284	eng	Tom and I went to see Mary off at the airport.
4017285	eng	How long can we survive in here before we run out of air?

4017336	eng	What's to stop Tom from doing it again?
4017337	eng	All right, let's try it again.
4017338	eng	Tom didn't have the nerve to do it again.
4017339	eng	Tom didn't have the courage to try doing it again.

4017362	eng	Have you been playing basketball all afternoon?
4017363	eng	It's normal to be a little afraid.

4017365	eng	What else would you advise?
4017366	eng	I should've listened to your advice.
4017367	eng	I should've followed your advice.

4019593	rus	Том задумчиво покивал головой.

4019598	rus	Раннее утро радовало приятной прохладой.
4019599	tur	O, Tom'un arabası mı?
4019600	rus	Ближе к вечеру появился Том.
4019601	rus	Том и Мэри ненадолго отошли от палатки.
4019603	rus	Том вытер кровь с лица.

4019605	rus	Улыбка застыла на лице Мэри.

4019613	rus	Между тем гул постепенно нарастал.
4019614	rus	Том выглядел весьма озадаченным.
4019616	rus	Мэри с трудом восстановила дыхание.
4019617	rus	Вскоре он увидел её.

4019623	rus	Внезапно корабль сильно тряхнуло.
4019624	tur	Onunla konuşmaya korkuyorum.
4019625	rus	Разбудил меня яркий свет.
4019626	rus	Открывать нам почему-то не торопились.
4019627	rus	Том удивлённо моргнул карими глазами.
4019628	tur	Onlarla konuşmayacağım.
4019629	rus	Мэри холодно взглянула на мать.
4019630	rus	Том посмотрел на свои ладони.
4019631	rus	Его как будто жаром обдало.
4019632	rus	Том явно не вышел ростом.
4019633	tur	Onunla konuşmayacağım.
4019634	rus	Где-то далеко закричал ворон.
4019635	rus	Не говори с ними об этом.
4019636	rus	Лицо его покрылось красными пятнами.
4019637	rus	Не говорите с ними об этом.
4019639	rus	Том изучающе посмотрел на Мэри.
4019640	rus	Том молчал, уткнувшись в тарелку.
4019641	rus	Не говори с ним об этом.
4019642	rus	Однако эта предосторожность оказалась лишней.
4019644	rus	Не говорите с ним об этом.
4019645	rus	Том внимательно посмотрел на экран.
4019646	rus	Не говори с ней об этом.
4019647	rus	Мэри вытерла с лица пот.
4019648	tur	O mağarada ne yapıyordun?

4019652	tur	Mahkeme ertelendi.
4019653	rus	Том был хорошо тренирован.
4019654	rus	Мэри пришлось вытереть слёзы.
4019655	rus	Жители деревни спешно вооружались.
4019656	tur	Onlarla konuşmanı istiyorum.
4019657	rus	Вино сделало Тома податливее.
4019658	rus	Меня посетило гениальное озарение.
4019659	rus	Я не хочу о ней говорить.
4019660	tur	Onunla konuşmanı istiyorum.
4019661	rus	Он вошёл в прихожую.
4019662	rus	На этом, похоже, параллели кончаются.
4019663	rus	Та сейчас же выполнила просьбу.
4019664	rus	Я не хочу о нём говорить.
4019666	rus	Всё было ясно и просто.
4019667	tur	Bana kefil oluyor musun?
4019668	rus	Вот тут уже напряглась я.
4019669	rus	Том встал и набросил халат.
4019670	rus	Он сделал большой глоток.
4019672	rus	Сознание возвращалось медленно, постепенно.
4019673	rus	Том тобою весьма доволен.
4019674	rus	Сегодня Тому просто сказочно повезло.
4019676	rus	Глаза Тома испуганно расширились.
4019677	rus	Буран бушевал два дня подряд.
4019678	rus	Сразу две вещи потрясли меня.
4019680	rus	Кряхтя, он сел на корточки.
4019681	rus	Том замолчал в задумчивости.
4019682	rus	Дважды повторять не пришлось.
4019683	rus	Том словно прирос к месту.
4019684	tur	Onlarla kendim konuşmak istiyorum.
4019685	rus	Мэри молча ждала объяснений.
4019686	rus	Получается совсем уж интересно.
4019687	rus	Мы вышли на развилку дороги.
4019688	rus	Он отвернулся к морю.
4019689	rus	Это, конечно, означало войну.
4019690	tur	Onunla kendim konuşmak istiyorum.
4019691	rus	Вот он, настоящий мужчина.
4019692	rus	Но всё оказалось не так.
4019694	rus	Том молча ждал продолжения.
4019695	rus	Ну вот, мне даже пострадать не дают спокойно.
4019696	rus	Это было величественное зрелище.
4019697	rus	Она медленно кивнула головой.
4019699	rus	Том уже не спал.
4019700	rus	Он тупо уставился на детей.
4019701	rus	Мэри посмотрела перед собой.
4019703	rus	Ласковые глаза Мэри наполнились слезами.
4019704	rus	Врага надо знать в лицо.
4019705	rus	Я как можно скорее должен всё выяснить.
4019707	rus	Это были её последние слова.
4019708	tur	Tom yanağında bir yara izi var.
4019709	rus	Том резко пришёл в себя.
4019710	rus	Он лишь покачал головой.
4019712	rus	Вода тонкой струйкой вытекла обратно.
4019713	rus	Страна славилась отважными мореплавателями.
4019714	rus	Том толкнул друга в бок.
4019715	tur	Seninle tekrar konuşmak istiyorum.
4019716	rus	Это добило меня окончательно.
4019717	rus	Том заложил руки за спину.
4019718	rus	Сердце Мэри бешено заколотилось.
4019719	rus	Она взяла сумочку со стола.
4019720	tur	Onlarla tekrar konuşmak istiyorum.

4019733	rus	Девушка отчаянно замотала головой.
4019736	rus	Его взгляд стал тяжёлым.
4019738	rus	Так! Это уже перебор.
4019740	rus	Мэри томно пожала плечами.
4019742	fra	Il faut que je vous quitte.
4019743	rus	Том выпустил Мэри из объятий.
4019744	tur	Onlarla konuşmak için gittim.

4019754	rus	Первыми дежурили мы с Томом.
4019755	rus	Пожалуйста, можно мне с ним поговорить?
4019757	rus	Мэри поджала губы с неодобрением.
4019758	rus	Самое сложное было сделано.
4019759	rus	На её лице отразилось смятение.
4019760	rus	За окном только-только начинался рассвет.
4019761	rus	Мне никто не ответил.
4019762	tur	Onlarla konuşmak için oraya gittim.
4019763	rus	Под вечер Мэри забеспокоилась.
4019764	rus	Первым молчание нарушил Том.
4019765	rus	Кажется, меня понесло не туда.
4019766	rus	Выстрела он не слышал.

4019777	rus	Она только покачала головой.
4019778	rus	Как ни странно, угроза подействовала.
4019779	tur	Bizimle konuşmanı istiyorum.
4019780	rus	Рассудительность девушки удивила его.
4019781	rus	Мы дожидаться его не стали.
4019783	rus	Его губы дрогнули в улыбке.
4019784	rus	За дверью снова послышался шум.
4019785	rus	Конечно, ими тоже нельзя пренебрегать.
4019787	rus	Постепенно стали сгущаться сумерки.
4019788	rus	Мэри посмотрела на шаль.
4019789	rus	Том смущённо потрогал подбородок.
4019790	fra	Où est ton autre frère ?

4019801	rus	Он разразился оглушительным хохотом.
4019802	rus	Тому хотелось кричать от досады.
4019803	rus	Колебаний больше не могло оставаться.
4019805	rus	Может быть, он постеснялся.
4019806	rus	Мы наконец вышли к озеру.
4019807	tur	İkinci tercihin nedir?
4019809	rus	Удивлённая Мэри наблюдала за ним.

4019812	ita	Dov'è l'altro vostro fratello?
4019813	rus	Возникла длинная неловкая пауза.
4019815	rus	Том сделал обиженный вид.
4019816	rus	Глаза Тома чуть расширились.
4019817	rus	Они вошли в покои.

4037430	rus	Том шагнул на балкон.
4037431	rus	Том отставил бокал вина.
4037432	rus	Мэри протянула руку ладонью вверх.
4037433	rus	Мэри бросила полотенце на кресло.
4037434	rus	Я получу нужные мне ответы.
4037435	rus	Её пальцы стиснулись на расчёске.
4037436	rus	Внезапно установилась полная тишина.
4037437	hun	Attól féltünk, hogy az apánk nem enged el minket.
4037438	rus	Том позволил себе чуть улыбнуться.
4037439	rus	Он вкусил запретный плод.
4037440	hun	Lapokban hozták a szekrényt.
4037441	rus	Значение данного выражения легко понять.
4037442	rus	Но это не всегда так.
4037443	rus	В этом — целостность совершенства.
4037444	rus	Но это в прошлом.
4037445	rus	Любой человек может быть обманут.
4037446	rus	Мы должны это осознавать.
4037447	rus	Душа моя полна горя.
4037448	rus	Его усилия были напрасны.
4037449	rus	Это может происходить по-разному.
4037450	rus	С этим согласны все.
4037451	rus	Это не от нас зависит.
4037452	rus	Меня это не удовлетворяет.
4037453	rus	Будьте нежны, мягки и сострадательны.
4037454	rus	Дайте им надлежащее название.
4037455	rus	В этом мы не ошибёмся.
4037456	rus	Иногда фанатизм полностью удаляет рассудок.
4037457	rus	Каждый фанатик является безумцем.
4037458	rus	Существует бесчисленное множество видов фанатизма.
4037459	rus	Вся ваша жизнь — фанатизм.
4037460	rus	Получи всё возможное честным путем.
4037461	rus	В труде проявляйте терпение.
4037462	rus	Удивительно, что так поступают немногие.
4037463	rus	Не использование их означает потерю.
4037464	rus	Подумайте над этим более серьёзно.
4037465	rus	Существует два способа траты денег.
4037466	rus	Ваше сердце затуманило ваш рассудок.
4037467	rus	Их около двадцати.
4037468	rus	Пожалуйста, поразмыслите над этим.
4037469	rus	Я сказал: «Вы, похоже, мёрзнете».
4037470	rus	Мне стыдно за них.
4037471	rus	Закон — это враг греха.
4037472	rus	Не возвращайтесь к былому рабству.
4037473	rus	Мы отвергаем это.
4037474	rus	Но истина находится посредине.
4037475	hun	Lapokra szedték szét a szekrényt.

4037487	rus	Добиться ответа было трудно.
4037488	rus	Учитель геометрии был педантом.
4037489	rus	Студент не верил в Бога.
4037490	rus	Студента иногда приглашали обедать.
4037491	rus	В классе реял весёлый шум.
4037492	rus	Теперь он всё увидел.
4037493	rus	Она была с ним.
4037494	rus	Отец встретил его на вокзале.
4037495	hun	Nyaralót veszek a Balaton mellett.
4037496	rus	Всё шло своим чередом.
4037497	rus	Год был труден.
4037498	rus	Потом опять наступила неизвестность.
4037499	rus	Я открыл формулу житейской мудрости.
4037500	rus	Этим занимается теоретическая физика.
4037501	rus	Он не послушался её советов.
4037502	rus	Это зависит от точки зрения.
4037503	rus	В относительном заключено абсолютное.
4037504	rus	Этот провал был не единственным.
4037505	rus	Мы пережили исторический кризис.
4037506	rus	Вот упрощённая схема этого опыта.
4037507	rus	Том внимательно посмотрел на собеседника.
4037508	rus	И он нашёл эти факты.
4037509	rus	Пылинки совершали причудливый хаотический танец.
4037510	rus	Ему пришлось уехать в Италию.
4037511	rus	Но это только на первый взгляд.
4037512	rus	Надо выбрать либо то, либо другое.
4037513	rus	В этом не было сомнения.
4037514	rus	Том усомнился в этом.
4037515	rus	Движение со скоростью света невозможно.
4037516	rus	Маленькая девочка стала взрослой дамой.
4037517	rus	Они были снова вместе.
4037518	rus	Том снова позвонил.
4037519	rus	Он не слышал этих возгласов.
4037520	rus	Эта мысль была не новой.
4037521	rus	Он не замечал ветра.
4037522	rus	Она не может быть принята.
4037523	rus	Швейцария придерживается традиционного нейтралитета.
4037524	rus	Теперь странное спокойствие овладело им.
4037525	hun	Ezen a héten nem kaptam zsebpénzt.
4037526	rus	Если понадобится, то я сделаю это нелегально.
4037527	rus	Том попросил Мэри не ходить одной.
4037528	rus	Том шёл ему навстречу.
4037529	rus	Том заговорил с Мэри о Достоевском.
4037530	rus	Разгадка этого явления была достигнута.
4037531	rus	Понимать это надо так.
4037532	rus	Но главное оставалось впереди.
4037533	rus	Разгадка этого явления скрывалась здесь.
4037534	rus	В комнате было холодно.
4037535	rus	Глубокое молчание воцарилось в зале.
4037536	rus	Физическое значение этого аппарата огромно.
4037537	rus	Том подвёл собеседника к окну.
4037538	rus	Вдали прозвучал сухой звук выстрела.
4037539	rus	Он был не одинок.
4037540	rus	Лучше всего приходите сейчас.
4037541	rus	У Мэри были дочери.
4037542	rus	Идея опытов принадлежала Тому.
4037543	rus	Я увидел свой портрет.
4037544	rus	Попытка встретилась с некоторыми затруднениями.
4037545	rus	Резолюция все же была принята.
4037546	rus	Они вышли через боковую платформу.
4037547	rus	Этот словарь такой же полезный, как и твой.
4037548	rus	Дело обстоит не так просто.
4037549	rus	Том отвергает спиритуализм.
4037550	rus	Том не собирался молчать.
4037551	rus	Мне понадобится немного времени.
4037552	rus	Он отказался от германского гражданства.
4037553	rus	Страна кишела нацистскими агентами.
4037554	rus	Расистская доктрина мне претила.
4037555	rus	Мне понадобится какое-то время.
4037556	rus	Он телеграфировал о своем согласии.
4037557	rus	Переезд в Бостон отпадал.
4037558	rus	Стук в дверь прервал лекцию.
4037559	rus	Да, это единственная надежда.
4037560	rus	История посмеялась над этими пророками.
4037561	rus	Нет, не уговаривайте меня.
4037562	rus	Всё же Том поехал в Бостон.
4037563	rus	Оба его гостя тоже встали.
4037564	rus	Том встал с кресла.
4037565	hun	Nem kell válaszolni a levélre.
4037566	rus	Вы знаете его способности.
4037567	rus	Мэри прочитала вслух письмо Тома.
4037568	rus	Том вопросительно посмотрел на гостя.
4037569	rus	Встаёт вопрос, что делать дальше.
4037570	rus	Тома поддержало несколько человек.
4037571	rus	Меня поразило выражение лица Тома.
4037572	rus	Он пригласил Мэри к себе.
4037573	rus	Вы мыслите широкими категориями.
4037574	rus	Они понимали всё без слов.
4037575	hun	A vizsgám sokkal jobban sikerült, mint vártam.
4037576	rus	Мэр города утвердил решение судьи.
4037577	rus	Я уже внёс свой вклад.
4037578	hun	Nem kell, hogy válaszolj Péter.
4037579	rus	Допросы последовали один за другим.
4037580	rus	Первым взял слово профессор Джексон.
4037581	rus	После этого его уволили.
4037582	rus	Он решительно отверг её доводы.
4037583	rus	Конференция состоялась на следующий день.
4037584	rus	Их бросили в тюрьму.
4037585	rus	Том окончил свою речь.
4037586	rus	Американцы — беспокойный народ.
4037587	rus	Он выглядел очень слабым физически.
4037588	rus	Это знают сегодня все.
4037589	rus	Это было в начале апреля.
4037590	hun	Nem kell mindenre válaszolni.
4037591	rus	Его перевезли в местный госпиталь.
4037592	rus	Мэри не дождалась и ушла домой.
4037593	hun	Igazán büszke lehetsz a fiadra.
4037594	hun	Nem válaszolsz a levelemre.

4037611	hun	Elolvashatom a képeslapodat?
4037612	rus	Просто позволь мне тебе помочь.
4037613	rus	Скажи мне, скажи мне.
4037614	rus	Том говорит, что я слишком много говорю.
4037615	rus	Том говорит, что я слишком много болтаю.
4037616	fra	Portez ce vieux whisky au juge blond qui fume.
4037617	rus	Почему это существенно?
4037618	rus	Я не вижу юмора в его шутках.
4037619	rus	Я не вижу юмора в её шутках.
4037620	rus	Это как мёртвому припарки.
4037621	rus	Вижу, вы двое познакомились.
4037622	fra	Tu me fais vraiment chier.
4037623	rus	Том очень слаб.

4037626	hun	Vidd el ezt a levelet a főnöknek.
4037627	rus	Английская дипломатия испокон веков руководствовалась холодным расчётом и славилась нечистой игрой.
4037628	rus	Общая вина — это ничья вина.
4037629	rus	Он хорошенько взглянул на бумаги.
4037630	rus	Том сказал Мэри встретить его в библиотеке.
4037631	rus	У Тома есть всё, что он хочет.
4037632	rus	Поезд всегда приходит по расписанию.
4037633	rus	Обе палаты Федерального Собрания распущены.
4037634	rus	Выступающий заткнулся на полуслове.
4037635	rus	Присутствующие переглядывались, но молчали.
4037636	rus	Ответить Мэри не успела.
4037637	rus	Всё, я пошла мыться.
4037638	rus	Вот теперь можно открыть глаза.
4037639	rus	Холодный виноградный сок был великолепен.
4037640	rus	С течением жизни мировоззрение человека значительно меняется.
4037641	rus	Впрочем, не об этом речь.
4037642	rus	Том задумался буквально на секунду.
4037643	rus	Впрочем, это уже твоя забота.
4037644	rus	Мое дело — технология.
4037645	rus	Он попытался сделать сальто назад.
4037646	rus	Доллар стал ключевой валютой планеты.
4037647	rus	Давай на сегодня заканчивать.
4037648	rus	Том чуть сам не оглох.
4037649	rus	Причём в данном случае второе важнее первого.
4037650	rus	Они нарушили неписаные правила игры.
4037651	rus	Все вопросы к Тому.
4037652	rus	Мы тщательно все просчитали.
4037653	rus	Слишком дорогая получилась система.
4037654	rus	Ничего, что-нибудь да придумаем.
4037655	rus	Я в этом ни бум-бум.
4037656	rus	Похоже, они готовятся к вторжению.
4037657	rus	Идею он, похоже, оценил.
4037658	rus	Это только кажется, что сложно.
4037659	rus	Сосредоточься, но не сильно напрягайся.
4037660	rus	Давай ещё раз подумаем.
4037661	rus	Только всё надо делать быстро.
4037662	rus	В помещении было жарко.
4037663	rus	Бабушка кормит меня как на убой.
4037664	rus	Рано ещё об этом говорить.
4037665	rus	Теперь уже Том задумался.
4037666	rus	Но это пока первый этап.
4037667	rus	Мэри, конечно, красивая, но ведь совсем молоденькая.
4037668	rus	Следующие события оказались еще интересней.
4037669	rus	В помещении опять повисла тишина.
4037670	rus	Том только укоряюще покачал головой.
4037671	rus	Здесь и обсуждать нечего.
4037672	rus	Она пришла со своей матерью.
4037673	rus	Их можно увидеть только в безлунную ночь.
