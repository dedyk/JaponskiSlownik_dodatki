6525861	eng	I wasn't very good at French when I was in college, but I've gotten better.
6525862	eng	I have an extra ticket for tonight's concert. Would you like to go with me?
6525863	eng	I don't know when Tom and Mary got married, but I do know they got married.
6525864	eng	Are you going to tell Tom what he has to do or would you rather I told him?
6525865	eng	Tom speaks French so well that many people think it's his native language.
6525866	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned on going bowling with John.
6525867	eng	Tom didn't need to stay home to help us. We could've done it by ourselves.
6525868	eng	Tom and Mary are good friends now, but they didn't like each other at first.
6525869	eng	Tom and John are both married to women who are much younger than they are.
6525870	eng	I think Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary not to do that anymore.
6525871	eng	I certainly had no idea Tom and Mary were thinking about getting divorced.
6525872	eng	Tom wanted to buy that painting, but I'd already sold it to someone else.
6525873	eng	Tom told Mary that she should be more careful the next time she did that.
6525874	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me where he'd spent his summer vacation.
6525875	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do the same thing I wanted to do.
6525876	eng	Tom wanted to give John and Mary something special on their anniversary.
6525877	eng	Tom spends a lot of time on his phone, texting and emailing his friends.
6525878	eng	Tom said that doing that was a mistake and that he wouldn't do it again.
6525879	eng	Tom said he wanted to know whether you plan to come to his party or not.
6525880	eng	Tom said he didn't know who Mary was planning on going to the prom with.
6525881	eng	Tom is planning to have a Christmas party at his house on Christmas Eve.
6525882	eng	Tom doesn't want to talk to you about what happened in Boston last week.
6525883	eng	Tom and Mary were both fired because they often showed up late for work.
6525884	eng	Tom and Mary say they haven't seen John since he and Alice got divorced.
6525885	eng	Tom and Mary look like teenagers, but they're both actually over thirty.
6525886	eng	Tom and Mary are celebrating their silver wedding anniversary this year.
6525887	eng	The couple I met in the park told me that their names were Tom and Mary.
6525888	eng	I'm looking for an apartment within a five-minute walk from the station.
6525889	eng	"Will both you and Tom be here tomorrow?" "I will be, but Tom won't be."
6525890	eng	Uncle Tom is my mother's brother and Uncle John is my father's brother.
6525891	eng	Tom says he's glad you're going to stay in Boston for another few days.
6525892	eng	Tom said he'd be here three hours ago, but he still hasn't gotten here.
6525893	eng	Tom said he wanted to make sure we didn't make the same mistake he did.
6525894	eng	Tom said he wanted to change out of his wet clothes into something dry.
6525895	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to go bowling with John.
6525896	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned on doing that this week.
6525897	eng	Tom didn't want to tell Mary about what had happened. She already knew.
6525898	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when Mary told him he didn't want to do that.
6525899	eng	Tom didn't need to tell Mary about what had happened. She already knew.
6525900	eng	Tom and Mary have both wanted to study French since they were thirteen.
6525901	eng	Tom and Mary each drank three cups of coffee before they left for work.
6525902	eng	Tom and Mary are moving things from their old house to their new house.
6525903	eng	I wasn't able to talk Tom into baking a cake for Mary's birthday party.
6525904	eng	Are you going to tell Tom what happened or would you rather I told him?
6525905	eng	When they were young, Tom and Mary used to often go swimming together.
6525906	eng	When they were in high school, Tom and Mary used to hang out together.
6525907	eng	Tom said he wanted to make sure Mary knew what she was supposed to do.
6525908	eng	Tom said he wanted to know when we were going to come over and help him.
6525909	eng	If you want to go to the movies tonight, perhaps Tom will go with you.
6525911	eng	Tom wanted to go to the concert with Mary, but she didn't want to go.
6525912	eng	Tom wanted to ask Mary to dance, but he was afraid that she'd say no.
6525913	eng	Tom thought Mary was cute, but he was too shy to say anything to her.
6525914	eng	Tom said he doesn't think Mary really wanted to do that this morning.
6525915	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary actually did her homework by herself.
6525916	eng	Tom hiked his skirt up to mid-thigh and dipped his toes in the water.
6525917	eng	Tom and John realized how small they were compared to the other boys.
6525918	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has been home since they graduated from college.
6525919	eng	I've never been to Australia, but my father's been there three times.
6525920	eng	I think Tom would be able to do that if he really put his mind to it.
6525921	eng	I think Tom was the one who was supposed to show Mary how to do that.
6525922	eng	I asked both Tom and Mary where John lived, but neither of them knew.
6525923	eng	Australia is one of the most interesting countries I've ever visited.
6525924	eng	Aunt Mary is my mother's sister and Aunt Alice is my father's sister.
6525925	eng	Tom said he didn't know why Mary wanted him to meet her in the park.
6525926	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
6525927	eng	Tom got out of the swimming pool and dried himself off with a towel.
6525928	eng	Tom felt that Mary wasn't doing everything she should've been doing.
6525929	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary what he really thought about her new hairstyle.
6525930	eng	Tom and Mary are both too drunk to drive. Could you drive them home?
6525931	eng	It's Tom's birthday tomorrow and I haven't bought him a present yet.
6525932	eng	I've never met Tom, but I've spoken to him on the phone a few times.
6525933	eng	I wasn't the most popular kid in school, but I had a lot of friends.
6525934	eng	I got up very early this morning, but my father got up even earlier.
6525935	eng	Either Tom or Mary probably has an extra pencil they could lend you.
6525936	eng	Tom's phone was confiscated because he was caught texting in class.
6525937	eng	Tom said that he wasn't really planning to go camping next weekend.
6525938	eng	Tom said that he was very certain that Mary didn't want to do that.
6525939	eng	Tom said that he was very certain that Mary didn't need to do that.
6525940	eng	Tom said that he was very certain that Mary didn't have to do that.
6525941	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't certain that John didn't need to do that.
6525942	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't certain that John didn't have to do that.
6525943	eng	Tom said he wanted to find a place to live close to where he works.
6525944	eng	Tom now knows why he should've paid more attention in French class.
6525945	eng	Tom and Mary are expecting a lot of people to attend their wedding.
6525946	eng	Tom and John have bought new suits, but they haven't worn them yet.
6525947	eng	I sent the package to Tom yesterday, so he should get it by Monday.
6525948	eng	Does Tom still think he's the only one here who can't speak French?
6525949	eng	"Were Tom and Mary at the party?" "Tom was there, but Mary wasn't."
6525950	eng	Tom's birthday is tomorrow and I haven't bought him a present yet.
6525951	eng	Tom wanted to talk to you about what happened in Boston last week.
6525952	eng	Tom said he didn't think he'd be able to do that without our help.
6525953	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary really wanted to do that by herself.
6525954	eng	Tom probably doesn't know how much time Mary will want to do that.
6525955	eng	Tom didn't have to think very long before he gave Mary his answer.
6525956	eng	Tom and Mary spent three hours on the porch talking to each other.
6525957	eng	Tom and Mary didn't get married until they were in their thirties.
6525958	eng	Tom and Mary are really close and they tell each other everything.
6525959	eng	Tom and John both became fathers when they were in their thirties.
6525960	eng	If you have time, you should visit that new museum on Park Street.
6525961	eng	I'm pretty sure that neither Tom nor Mary has ever been to Boston.
6525962	eng	I bet Tom and Mary each thirty dollars that they couldn't do that.
6525963	eng	When we were in high school, Tom and I used to hang out together.
6525964	eng	When was the last time Tom and Mary went out for dinner together?
6525965	eng	We're going on a picnic tomorrow. Would you like to come with us?
6525966	eng	Tom wanted to buy a motorcycle, but his parents wouldn't let him.
6525967	eng	Tom wanted to buy a bass guitar, but he didn't have enough money.
6525968	eng	Tom says he needs time to think about what he's going to do next.
6525969	eng	Tom said he didn't think that we should even consider doing that.
6525970	eng	Tom said he didn't know who Mary was planning on doing that with.
6525971	eng	Tom said he didn't know where Mary had bought her pearl necklace.
6525972	eng	Tom is going to have a birthday party for Mary on Monday.
6525973	eng	Tom has a scar on his wrist from when he tried to commit suicide.
6525974	eng	Tom found an interesting book about Boston in the school library.
6525975	eng	Tom didn't seem surprised when I told him why I didn't like Mary.
6525976	eng	Tom bumped into Mary, causing her to spill her coffee on herself.
6525977	eng	Does Tom still think he's the only one here who can speak French?
6525978	eng	You should call your wife and tell her you'll be late for dinner.
6525979	eng	Tom's teacher said that he needs to pay more attention in class.
6525980	eng	Tom said that Mary was certain that John didn't want to do that.
6525981	eng	Tom said that Mary was certain that John didn't need to do that.
6525982	eng	Tom said that Mary was certain that John didn't have to do that.
6525983	eng	Tom said he wanted to find an apartment close to where he works.
6525984	eng	Tom said he didn't think he could help you move the piano today.
6525985	eng	Tom said he didn't know who Mary was planning on giving that to.
6525986	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned on going with us.
6525987	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary could do that without some help.
6525988	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary to finish doing what he asked her to do.
6525989	eng	Tom is still waiting for Mary to do what she's been asked to do.
6525990	eng	Tom doesn't know who Mary is planning on going to the prom with.
6525991	eng	Tom came into the room, took off his hat and coat, and sat down.
6525992	eng	Tom and Mary were both fatter three years ago than they are now.
6525993	eng	Tom and Mary sang a duet and John accompanied them on the piano.
6525994	eng	It looks like both Tom and John haven't shaved in a couple days.
6525995	eng	I think it was very unfair of Tom to criticize me for dong that.
6525996	eng	I know Tom didn't need to do that, but I think he did it anyway.
6525997	eng	I have an extra ticket for tonight's concert. Would you like it?
6525998	eng	I definitely remember seeing a picture of Tom and Mary together.
6525999	eng	Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were writing a novel together?
6526000	eng	After three hours, Tom and Mary ran out of things to talk about.
6526001	eng	When they were kids, Tom and Mary did a lot of things together.
6526002	eng	Tom will probably lie to Mary about where he spent the weekend.
6526003	eng	Tom will probably end up in prison if he doesn't straighten up.
6526004	eng	Tom will probably be very unfriendly after what you did to him.
6526005	eng	Tom was happy that he could meet people from various countries.
6526006	eng	Tom wanted to give Mary something special on their anniversary.
6526007	eng	Tom said that Mary was certain that she didn't need to do that.
6526008	eng	Tom said that Mary was certain that she didn't have to do that.
6526009	eng	Tom said he wanted to make sure that that doesn't happen again.
6526010	eng	Tom said he wanted to know why you're not working here anymore.
6526011	eng	Tom said he wanted to do something special for Mary's birthday.
6526012	eng	Tom said he still had some unfinished business to take care of.
6526013	eng	Tom said he didn't have the time or the inclination to do that.
6526014	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really wanted to do that today.
6526015	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary really wanted to do that again.
6526016	eng	Tom said Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
6526017	eng	Tom promised Mary he wouldn't say anything about what happened.
6526018	eng	Tom pretended not to see Mary when he passed her on the street.
6526019	eng	Tom is waiting for you to finish doing what he asked you to do.
6526020	eng	Tom didn't need to tell me about what happened. I already knew.
6526021	eng	Tom and Mary are competing against each other for the same job.
6526022	eng	The dress that Mary bought yesterday doesn't fit her very well.
6526023	eng	Let me give you my phone number in case you need to contact me.
6526024	eng	If you see Tom and Mary, ask them how their children are doing.
6526025	eng	I won't be able to get everything done that needs to be done.
6526026	eng	I'd like to do that now, but Tom would rather wait until later.
6526027	eng	I wasn't able to get everything done that I was supposed to do.
6526028	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what I wanted to do.
6526029	eng	I was surprised that Tom didn't need to do what I needed to do.
6526030	eng	I can't believe Tom and Mary are getting married to each other.
6526031	eng	Boston is one of the most interesting cities I've ever visited.
6526032	eng	We're waiting for you to finish doing what we asked you to do.
6526033	eng	We're going on a picnic tomorrow. Do you want to come with us?
6526034	eng	Tom, Mary, John and Alice often play string quartets together.
6526035	eng	Tom told me that Mary said she didn't want to do that anymore.
6526036	eng	Tom told me it would probably take him a long time to do that.
6526037	eng	Tom should probably tell Mary that he doesn't want to do that.

6526050	eng	Tom is trying hard to finish doing that by the end of the day.
6526051	eng	Tom is going to have a birthday party for Mary Monday evening.
6526052	eng	Tom hoped that Mary would be well enough to come to his party.
6526053	eng	Tom doesn't live far from us, but we don't see him very often.
6526054	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary really plans to go bowling with John.
6526055	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary really plans on doing that this week.

6526058	eng	Tom and John introduced me to their new girlfriends yesterday.
6526059	eng	Tom and I are in the same class, but I've never spoken to him.
6526060	eng	If your dog could talk, what do you think it would say to you?
6526061	eng	I'm sorry for making you look stupid in front of your friends.
6526062	eng	I wasn't aware that anything out of the ordinary had happened.
6526063	eng	I used to play golf, but I quit playing about three years ago.
6526064	eng	I thought Tom and Mary said they weren't going to get married.
6526065	eng	I think Tom and Mary both said they've already read this book.
6526066	eng	I don't think either Tom or Mary is ever going to get married.
6526067	eng	I don't think I'd be able to forgive Tom if he did that to me.
6526068	eng	I didn't know why Tom didn't want to do that until he told me.
6526069	eng	Tom wants to go to the concert, but he doesn't have a ticket.
6526070	eng	Tom wanted to go to the concert, but he didn't have a ticket.

6526084	eng	Tom is having a surprise party for Mary tonight at his place.
6526085	eng	Tom is having a bachelor party for John at his place tonight.
6526086	eng	Tom is going to need a little more time to finish doing that.

6526088	eng	Tom got the job because he can speak both French and English.
6526089	eng	Tom doesn't live far from me, but I don't see him very often.
6526090	eng	Tom didn't have to come into work today. I wonder why he did.
6526091	eng	Tom and Mary were both born in Boston and they grew up there.
6526092	eng	Tom and Mary both said they thought they could pass the test.
6526093	eng	Tom and Mary are two of the most boring people I've ever met.
6526094	eng	The doctor said that Tom didn't need to stay in the hospital.
6526095	eng	My car isn't very reliable. I'm thinking of buying a new one.
6526096	eng	It's going to be cheaper in the long run to use real leather.
6526097	eng	I'm sure you could do that if you really put your mind to it.
6526098	eng	I wasn't the only one in the room that couldn't speak French.
6526099	eng	I wanted to talk with Tom yesterday, but I couldn't find him.
6526100	eng	I think Tom needs to do that, even though he says he doesn't.
6526101	eng	I couldn't decide which shirt to buy, so I didn't buy either.
6526102	eng	Does Tom still think Mary would like to go to Boston with us?
6526103	eng	You won't be able to find a babysitter on such short notice.
6526104	eng	You look the same now as you looked the last time I saw you.
6526105	eng	When was the last time Tom and Mary went to Boston together?
6526106	eng	When the weather's bad, I usually stay at home and watch TV.
6526107	eng	Tom's parents aren't going to let him go to Boston with you.
6526108	eng	Tom wears the same clothes that all his friends are wearing.

6526121	eng	Tom didn't need to get up as early today as he usually does.

6526124	eng	Tom and Mary are both having trouble with math, aren't they?
6526125	eng	Tom and John might bring their wives and children with them.
6526126	eng	That incident happened when both Tom and Mary were thirteen.
6526127	eng	I wasn't able to get everything done that needed to be done.
6526128	eng	I think Tom would be able to do that if he really needed to.
6526129	eng	I know that Tom and Mary have never gone to Boston together.
6526130	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
6526131	eng	Do you mean you didn't know Tom and Mary had gotten married?
6526132	eng	Are you going to tell Tom what needs to be done or should I?
6526133	eng	Tom wanted to know if you're planning to come to his party.
6526134	eng	Tom said that he was very certain that Mary had to do that.

6526166	eng	The instructions were too complicated for me to figure out.
6526167	eng	It's going to be three months before our house is finished.
6526168	eng	I won't be able to get everything done that has to be done.
6526169	eng	I wanted to stay home, but Tom insisted that I go with him.
6526170	eng	I think we should've turned left at that last intersection.
6526171	eng	I think Tom already knows why Mary doesn't want to do that.
6526172	eng	You don't need all of these. You should sell some of them.

6526202	eng	The police are still trying to figure out how Tom escaped.
6526203	eng	It's going to be impossible to get a visa on short notice.
6526204	eng	I'd prefer to play basketball rather than play volleyball.
6526205	eng	I'd prefer not to call Tom. I'd rather write him an email.
6526206	eng	I'd like to go now, but Tom would rather wait until later.
6526207	eng	I'd be curious to know what both Tom and Mary have to say.
6526208	eng	I wasn't the only one who wanted to leave the party early.
6526209	eng	I wasn't at school the day we had our class picture taken.

6526214	eng	I don't need to call Tom. I wrote him an email last night.
6526215	eng	I can't believe how bad the service at this restaurant is.
6526216	eng	Does Tom still want to stay in Boston with us next summer?
6526217	eng	Does Tom still want to go shopping with us this afternoon?
6526218	eng	Could you please move those boxes from over there to here?
6526219	eng	Both Tom and Mary weren't feeling well, so they went home.
6526220	eng	Are you going to tell Tom what he needs to do or should I?
6526221	eng	You weren't wearing your uniform the last time I saw you.
6526222	eng	You can turn off the TV if you like. I'm not watching it.

6526260	eng	Nobody told us Tom and Mary were planning to get married.
6526261	eng	It looks like we're going to have an interesting evening.
6526262	eng	I'm not sure whether I really want that to happen or not.
6526263	eng	I'll see you tomorrow evening unless I have to work late.

6526272	eng	I don't think Tom wants to spend any more time in Boston.
6526273	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary are ever going to get married.

6526318	eng	The man I met in the park told me that his name was Tom.
6526319	eng	The doctors did everything they could to keep Tom alive.
6526320	eng	Perhaps when Tom and Mary are older they'll get married.

6526322	eng	I'm not tall enough to reach the books on the top shelf.
6526323	eng	I won't be able to blow out all the candles on the cake.

6526326	eng	I heard that Tom and Mary are going to get married soon.
6526327	eng	I don't think I'll go out today because it's quite cold.
6526328	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary went to Boston together.
6526329	eng	Even Tom himself doesn't think he'll be able to do that.
6526330	eng	Do you think Tom and Mary are ever going to get married?
6526331	eng	Didn't you know that Tom and Mary often travel together?
6526332	eng	Are you going to tell Tom what he has to do or should I?
6526333	eng	"Do you and Tom often do that?" "I do, but Tom doesn't."
6526334	eng	Tom's speech wasn't as boring as I thought it would be.

6526372	eng	Tom and I ran into each other in the library on Monday.
6526373	eng	Let's not eat mashed potatoes for dinner again tonight.
6526374	eng	It won't be any problem to reschedule your appointment.
6526375	eng	It was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be.
6526376	eng	I'm sure Tom didn't know he wasn't supposed to do that.
6526377	eng	I'm sorry, but I can't come to your party next weekend.
6526378	eng	I won't be able to stay in Boston as long as I want to.

6526392	eng	When did you find out that Tom didn't have to do that?
6526393	eng	Tomorrow's a holiday, so I don't have to get up early.

6526448	eng	Mary and Alice showed me pictures of their boyfriends.
6526449	eng	It's too bad we didn't see Tom when we were in Boston.
6526450	eng	It won't be any problem to reschedule the appointment.
6526451	eng	In those days, Tom and Mary used to hang out together.
6526452	eng	I've seen that guy before, but I can't remember where.
6526453	eng	I'm not happy with how the painters painted my office.
6526454	eng	I wasn't really trying to convince Tom to do anything.
6526455	eng	I wasn't able to find the documents I was looking for.
6526456	eng	I wasn't able to blow out all the candles on the cake.
6526457	eng	I think we should get out of here as soon as possible.
6526458	eng	I think Tom will like the presents you bought for him.
6526459	eng	How many hours does it take to get to Boston by plane?
6526460	eng	Do Tom and Mary like to watch the same kind of movies?
6526461	eng	We have something special planned for Tom's birthday.
6526462	eng	We didn't go to the party because we weren't invited.
6526463	eng	Tom will probably do that as soon as you tell him to.
6526464	eng	Tom went to the cemetery to visit his mother's grave.
6526465	eng	Tom was afraid to tell his parents what had happened.
6526466	eng	Tom was Mary's boyfriend when she was in high school.
6526467	eng	Tom wanted to learn everything he could about Boston.
6526468	eng	Tom wanted to ask you if you'd help him next weekend.
6526469	eng	Tom slipped and fell as he was going down the stairs.
6526470	eng	Tom should tell Mary that he doesn't want to do that.
6526471	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows why he wants to do that.
6526472	eng	Tom said that he was really worried about his future.
6526473	eng	Tom said that he was really the first one to do that.
6526474	eng	Tom said that he was really sure that he had to do that.
6526475	eng	Tom said that he was really sorry for what he'd done.
6526476	eng	Tom said that he was really interested in doing that.
6526477	eng	Tom said that he was really glad Mary didn't do that.
6526478	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't going camping next weekend.
6526479	eng	Tom said that Mary was glad that John didn't do that.
6526480	eng	Tom said that Mary was certain that he could do that.
6526481	eng	Tom said he wasn't sure he was doing the right thing.
6526482	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wanted to do that with John.
6526483	eng	Tom said he didn't think he could do that by himself.
6526484	eng	Tom said he didn't remember what happened that night.
6526485	eng	Tom said he didn't remember seeing Mary at the party.
6526486	eng	Tom said he didn't really know how to swim very well.
6526487	eng	Tom said he didn't really know how to surf very well.
6526488	eng	Tom said he didn't know where Mary wanted to do that.
6526489	eng	Tom said he didn't know what Mary was supposed to do.
6526490	eng	Tom said he didn't ever win when he played badminton.
6526491	eng	Tom said he didn't care whether we helped him or not.
6526492	eng	Tom said he didn't care whether Mary did that or not.
6526493	eng	Tom said he didn't believe Mary would really do that.
6526494	eng	Tom said Mary wants to do that before John gets here.
6526495	eng	Tom said Mary knew he didn't want to do that anymore.
6526496	eng	Tom isn't going to give Mary the money she asked for.
6526497	eng	Tom is very satisfied with the work Mary did for him.
6526498	eng	Tom is in the parking lot right now, waiting for you.
6526499	eng	Tom is hoping to find a solution to the problem soon.
6526500	eng	Tom is going to need a few more hours to finish this.
6526501	eng	Tom is going to have to make some very tough choices.
6526502	eng	Tom is going to have a lot more questions than we do.
6526503	eng	Tom is going to go there the same way he always does.
6526504	eng	Tom hoped Mary wouldn't find out about what happened.
6526505	eng	Tom has bought a new suit, but he hasn't worn it yet.
6526506	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would ever be able to do that.
6526507	eng	Tom doesn't know when Mary is planning on doing that.
6526508	eng	Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take to do that.
6526509	eng	Tom doesn't doubt that Mary was the one who did that.
6526510	eng	Tom didn't want to make the same mistake as Mary had.
6526511	eng	Tom didn't have to tell Mary about what had happened.
6526512	eng	Tom didn't get out of the car because it was raining.
6526513	eng	Tom asked me if I really wanted to do that by myself.
6526514	eng	Tom asked Mary if she wanted to do that this morning.
6526515	eng	Tom asked Mary if she really wanted to do that today.
6526516	eng	Tom and Mary say they want to get married right away.
6526517	eng	Tom and Mary said they want to write a book together.
6526518	eng	Tom and Mary are never going to see each other again.
6526519	eng	Tom and Mary are going to have a lot of fun together.
6526520	eng	Tom and Mary are each going to need their own lawyer.
6526521	eng	Tom and Mary are both very conservative, aren't they?
6526522	eng	Tom and Mary are both telling the truth, aren't they?
6526523	eng	Tom and Mary are both prepared for this, aren't they?
6526524	eng	Tom and Mary are both already in Boston, aren't they?
6526525	eng	Tom and John showed me pictures of their girlfriends.
6526526	eng	The museum we went to yesterday was very interesting.
6526527	eng	Should I tell Tom or would you rather he didn't know?
6526528	eng	It's been three months since Tom escaped from prison.
6526529	eng	If Tom didn't need to be here, he wouldn't have come.
6526530	eng	If Tom didn't have to be here, he wouldn't have come.
6526531	eng	I've never spoken to the old man who lives next door.
6526532	eng	I'm not really trying to convince Tom to do anything.
6526533	eng	I wasn't able to say everything that I wanted to say.
6526534	eng	I thought you said you needed to do that by yourself.
6526535	eng	I think Tom will like the present you bought for him.
6526536	eng	I think Tom and Mary are going to be able to do that.
6526537	eng	I really don't have time to deal with this right now.
6526538	eng	I need to know what's likely to happen if we do that.
6526539	eng	I don't usually walk to work, but I did this morning.
6526540	eng	I don't think Tom and Mary are married to each other.
6526541	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
6526542	eng	I couldn't fall asleep, even though I was very tired.
6526543	eng	I asked Tom and Mary why they'd never gotten married.
6526544	eng	How did you find out that Tom didn't need to do that?
6526545	eng	How did you find out that Tom didn't have to do that?
6526546	eng	Do Tom and Mary like to do that same kinds of things?
6526547	eng	Did you know that Tom and Mary got married last week?
6526548	eng	Tom will probably still be interested in doing that.
6526549	eng	Tom will probably be faster at doing that than Mary.
6526550	eng	Tom will probably be better at doing that than Mary.
6526551	eng	Tom will have the time to do that tomorrow, I think.
6526552	eng	Tom was walking his dog when I saw him this morning.
6526553	eng	Tom wanted to know how he could lose weight quickly.
6526554	eng	Tom told John that he and Mary were getting married.
6526555	eng	Tom thought Mary could do that if she had some help.
6526556	eng	Tom studies French every evening for thirty minutes.
6526557	eng	Tom says he's going to find out what has to be done.
6526558	eng	Tom said that he was really glad that Mary did that.
6526559	eng	Tom said that he wanted me to introduce him to Mary.
6526560	eng	Tom said that Mary was sure that John would do that.
6526561	eng	Tom said he wanted to buy a couple of sleeping bags.
6526562	eng	Tom said he thought Mary wanted to do that for John.
6526563	eng	Tom said he isn't going to eat until Mary gets home.
6526564	eng	Tom said he didn't want to argue about this anymore.
6526565	eng	Tom said he didn't think he was very good at French.
6526566	eng	Tom said he didn't think he could do that right now.
6526567	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would want to do that.
6526568	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would need to do that.
6526569	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that.
6526570	eng	Tom said he didn't really know how to ski very well.
6526571	eng	Tom said he didn't plan on staying here much longer.
6526572	eng	Tom said he didn't know why the picnic was canceled.
6526573	eng	Tom said Mary wanted to do that as soon as possible.
6526574	eng	Tom said Mary thought she should do that by herself.
6526575	eng	Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that today.
6526576	eng	Tom lost control of his car and crashed into a wall.
6526577	eng	Tom lives about three blocks from the train station.
6526578	eng	Tom jumped into the pool and swam to the other side.
6526579	eng	Tom is thinking about putting his house up for sale.
6526580	eng	Tom is still trying to figure out why that happened.
6526581	eng	Tom is still not sure why Mary wants him to do that.
6526582	eng	Tom is much younger than the rest of his classmates.
6526583	eng	Tom is eventually going to find out who killed Mary.
6526584	eng	Tom is at the supermarket buying food for the party.
6526585	eng	Tom is approximately the same age as the rest of us.
6526586	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary would really want to do that.
6526587	eng	Tom doesn't live here anymore. He's moved to Boston.
6526588	eng	Tom doesn't know who Mary is planning on going with.
6526589	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary really plans to go with us.
6526590	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary really plans on doing that.
6526591	eng	Tom doesn't believe Mary really did that by herself.
6526592	eng	Tom didn't think he could do what needed to be done.
6526593	eng	Tom asked Mary why she thought he wanted to do that.
6526594	eng	Tom and Mary told me that they were already married.
6526595	eng	Tom and Mary just told me they were getting married.
6526596	eng	Tom and Mary can't stand being away from each other.
6526597	eng	Tom and Mary both started speaking at the same time.
6526598	eng	Tom and Mary aren't very likely to do that together.
6526599	eng	Tom and Mary are going to name their daughter Alice.
6526600	eng	Tom and Mary are both very competitive, aren't they?
6526601	eng	Tom and Mary are both usually punctual, aren't they?
6526602	eng	Tom and Mary are both staying with you, aren't they?
6526603	eng	Tom and Mary are both really obnoxious, aren't they?
6526604	eng	Tom and Mary are both really conceited, aren't they?
6526605	eng	Tom and Mary are both really ambitious, aren't they?
6526606	eng	Tom and Mary are both quite overweight, aren't they?
6526607	eng	Tom and Mary are both pretty conceited, aren't they?
6526608	eng	Tom and Mary are both pretty ambitious, aren't they?
6526609	eng	Tom and Mary are both a little nervous, aren't they?
6526610	eng	Tom and Mary are both a little jealous, aren't they?
6526611	eng	Tom and John say they miss their wives and children.
6526612	eng	Tom and I are going to play handball this afternoon.
6526613	eng	This road is very dangerous. Please drive carefully.
6526614	eng	There have been many accidents at that intersection.
6526615	eng	That's one of the problems we're still dealing with.
6526616	eng	Mary and Alice showed me pictures of their husbands.
6526617	eng	Last Monday was a holiday, so the banks were closed.
6526618	eng	It's going to be three weeks before I see you again.
6526619	eng	I've been invited to Tom's wedding, but Mary hasn't.
6526620	eng	I wonder what it would be like to be married to Tom.
6526621	eng	I wasn't the only one who got up early this morning.
6526622	eng	I wasn't the one who advised Tom to stop doing that.
6526623	eng	I wasn't surprised when Tom told me where he'd gone.
6526624	eng	I wasn't getting any help from anyone, so I gave up.
6526625	eng	I thought you said you needed me to do that for you.
6526626	eng	I liked Tom and Mary better before they got married.
6526627	eng	I like pinto beans, but I don't eat them very often.
6526628	eng	I know that Tom and Mary have never danced together.
6526629	eng	I know Tom and John, but I've never met their wives.
6526630	eng	I have something special planned for Tom's birthday.
6526631	eng	I had to stop at almost every light on the way here.
6526632	eng	I didn't have enough cash, so I paid by credit card.
6526633	eng	I can play the guitar. Tom can play the guitar, too.
6526634	eng	Do Tom and Mary live in the same apartment building?
6526635	eng	Do Tom and Mary like to read the same kind of books?
6526636	eng	Are you going to tell Tom what happened or should I?
6526637	eng	"Is Tom here?" "No, he left just a few minutes ago."
6526638	eng	Tom will probably be really disappointed, won't he?
6526639	eng	Tom wasn't at school last week because he was sick.
6526640	eng	Tom wanted to know how long we're going to be here.
6526641	eng	Tom wanted to buy a car, but he couldn't afford to.
6526642	eng	Tom understands French better than he can speak it.
6526643	eng	Tom thinks Mary is the prettiest girl in his class.
6526644	eng	Tom takes his children to the park every afternoon.
6526645	eng	Tom slipped and fell as he was getting off the bus.
6526646	eng	Tom says he isn't yet sure what caused the problem.
6526647	eng	Tom says he doesn't remember where he put his keys.
6526648	eng	Tom said that he wasn't going camping next weekend.
6526649	eng	Tom said that he wasn't angry, but that he was sad.
6526650	eng	Tom said that he was really glad he didn't do that.
6526651	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't the first one to do that.
6526652	eng	Tom said that Mary wasn't interested in doing that.
6526653	eng	Tom said that Mary was sure that she would do that.
6526654	eng	Tom said that Mary was planning to be here by 2:30.
6526655	eng	Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
6526656	eng	Tom said he doesn't want to do that this afternoon.
6526657	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would really do that.
6526658	eng	Tom said he didn't remember asking Mary to do that.
6526659	eng	Tom said he didn't really know how old his dog was.
6526660	eng	Tom said he didn't plan on going anywhere tomorrow.
6526661	eng	Tom said he didn't care whether we did that or not.
6526662	eng	Tom said he didn't care whether Mary stayed or not.
6526663	eng	Tom said Mary thought he shouldn't do that anymore.
6526664	eng	Tom said Mary knew he wanted to do that by himself.
6526665	eng	Tom said Mary knew he didn't want to do that again.
6526666	eng	Tom now has to get up much earlier than he used to.
6526667	eng	Tom lives near us, but we don't see him very often.
6526668	eng	Tom isn't as good at doing that as he thinks he is.
6526669	eng	Tom is very fortunate to have Mary working for him.
6526670	eng	Tom is pleased with the way things have turned out.
6526671	eng	Tom is only asking you to help him for a few hours.
6526672	eng	Tom is one of the most boring people I've ever met.
6526673	eng	Tom is here to make sure that doesn't happen again.
6526674	eng	Tom is going to talk about that at today's meeting.
6526675	eng	Tom is going to have steak and potatoes for dinner.
6526676	eng	Tom has been working as a teacher for thirty years.
6526677	eng	Tom has been getting some very interesting results.
6526678	eng	Tom has already told Mary that he wants to do that.
6526679	eng	Tom got up, took a shower, shaved, and got dressed.
6526680	eng	Tom doesn't think Mary really knows how to do that.
6526681	eng	Tom doesn't remember his parents ever spanking him.
6526682	eng	Tom doesn't know who Mary is planning to stay with.
6526683	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary is planning to do that.
6526684	eng	Tom doesn't know where Mary is planning on staying.
6526685	eng	Tom didn't tell Mary that he'd been married before.
6526686	eng	Tom didn't need to wear a suit and tie, but he did.
6526687	eng	Tom didn't need to take a taxi. He could've walked.
6526688	eng	Tom didn't need to speak. Mary did all the talking.
6526689	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary didn't understand French.
6526690	eng	Tom didn't have to take a taxi. He could've walked.
6526691	eng	Tom criticized Mary for the way she was doing that.
6526692	eng	Tom couldn't do that last week because he was sick.
6526693	eng	Tom changed his number after breaking up with Mary.
6526694	eng	Tom and Mary aren't very likely to travel together.
6526695	eng	Tom and Mary aren't much different from each other.
6526696	eng	Tom and Mary are definitely more than just friends.
6526697	eng	Tom and Mary are both willing to help, aren't they?
6526698	eng	Tom and Mary are both studying French, aren't they?
6526699	eng	Tom and Mary are both still teenagers, aren't they?
6526700	eng	Tom and Mary are both good guitarists, aren't they?
6526701	eng	Tom and John both really wanted to dance with Mary.
6526702	eng	There's no need to hurry. We've got plenty of time.
6526703	eng	That's the house where both Tom and Mary were born.
6526704	eng	Since Tom doesn't want to do that, Mary will do it.
6526705	eng	Please be careful with this knife. It's very sharp.
6526706	eng	Perhaps Tom and Mary should be doing that together.
6526707	eng	I'm sure you could do that if you really needed to.
6526708	eng	I'm not the only one who got up early this morning.
6526709	eng	I'm not the one who advised Tom to stop doing that.
6526710	eng	I wasn't very hungry, so I didn't finish my dinner.
6526711	eng	I wasn't the only one who was permitted to do that.
6526712	eng	I wasn't the only one who didn't get enough to eat.
6526713	eng	I wasn't the only one at the party who fell asleep.
6526714	eng	I wasn't supposed to tell Tom that Mary was coming.
6526715	eng	I wasn't able to do everything that I wanted to do.
6526716	eng	I thought you said that you didn't need to do that.
6526717	eng	I might go shopping tomorrow, but I'm not sure yet.
6526718	eng	I know that Tom and Mary are married to each other.
6526719	eng	I haven't seen Tom and Mary since they got married.
6526720	eng	I don't believe Tom and Mary will ever get married.
6526721	eng	I didn't know Tom and Mary were your grandchildren.
6526722	eng	I can't believe that Tom and John are grandfathers.
6526723	eng	Does Tom still want me to drive him to the airport?
6526724	eng	Does Tom still think that I should go talk to Mary?
6526725	eng	Does Tom still think he'll be in Boston all summer?
6526726	eng	Do you think Tom will get the job he's applied for?
6526727	eng	Do you have a mop and a bucket that I could borrow?
6526728	eng	Did you know that Tom and Mary have three children?
6526729	eng	What's the real reason Tom didn't need to do that?
6526730	eng	What's the real reason Tom didn't have to do that?
6526731	eng	Uncle Tom and Uncle John are my mother's brothers.
6526732	eng	Tom will probably travel to Australia next summer.
6526733	eng	Tom will be helping me do that tomorrow afternoon.
6526734	eng	Tom was in a difficult situation, so I helped him.
6526735	eng	Tom wanted to meet with you to discuss the matter.
6526736	eng	Tom wanted to know where Mary went to high school.
6526737	eng	Tom wanted to ask you some questions about French.
6526738	eng	Tom used to like Mary, but now he can't stand her.
6526739	eng	Tom told me that he thinks he's going to die soon.
6526740	eng	Tom thought I might not want to do that by myself.
6526741	eng	Tom should've told Mary that he wanted to do that.
6526742	eng	Tom says he's having a lot of fun learning French.
6526743	eng	Tom said that he was really interested in archery.
6526744	eng	Tom said that he was really glad that he did that.
6526745	eng	Tom said that he was really determined to do that.
6526746	eng	Tom said that Mary was going camping next weekend.
6526747	eng	Tom said he wasn't used to this kind of cold weather.
6526748	eng	Tom said he was sure he was doing the right thing.
6526749	eng	Tom said he was going to need a little more money.
6526750	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might want to do that today.
6526751	eng	Tom said he didn't want to live like this anymore.
6526752	eng	Tom said he didn't think Mary would do that today.
6526753	eng	Tom said he didn't remember asking you to do that.
6526754	eng	Tom said he didn't really want to talk about this.
6526755	eng	Tom said he didn't plan on going there by himself.
6526756	eng	Tom said he didn't plan on going back there again.
6526757	eng	Tom said he didn't often win when he played chess.
6526758	eng	Tom said he didn't know if he had time to do that.
6526759	eng	Tom said he didn't have time to do that right now.
6526760	eng	Tom said he didn't feel like doing that right now.

6527159	eng	The new restaurant on Park Street is very good.
6527160	eng	That's a good idea. Why didn't I think of that?
6527161	eng	Sometimes I can't even read my own handwriting.
6527162	eng	Should I tell Tom or would you rather I didn't?
6527163	eng	Perhaps Tom and Mary ought to do that together.

6527170	eng	I'm sure you could do that if you really tried.
6527171	eng	I'm not sure whether I really want that or not.
6527172	eng	I wasn't willing to do what Tom asked me to do.
6527173	eng	I want you to call me as soon as you get there.
6527174	eng	I thought you said you needed to do that today.
6527175	eng	I thought you said Tom wasn't going to be here.
6527176	eng	I think Tom and Mary are married to each other.

6527226	eng	Tom said he didn't have any desire to do that.
6527227	eng	Tom said he didn't feel like doing that again.
6527228	eng	Tom said Mary knew he wanted to do that again.
6527229	eng	Tom probably won't find what he's looking for.
