Nem újkeletű dolog az ilyen, mint tudom, korábban is megesett az oldalon. – Általában mi volt a kiváltó ok? – Egy, vagy több szó, melyet hol az egyik, hol a másik fél nem ismert el. – Amiről nem hallottam, az nincs is. – Ez az elv. Így akkor hát két szerkesztő is leszavazná például a főurat, mert a történelemórán kívül egyszer sem hallották, főpincérnek meg el se tudják képzelni. A fiatalok nyelvében már ilyen jelentésben nincs meg, mégis csupán így szerepel a korpuszon. Persze most fel lehet háborodni, na akkor nem jó az eloszlás, egyre ritkábban használt a szó, – és így tanítanád a zsenge elméjű külföldit magyarra? – Rájöttem, ilyenekre marhaság egy percet is rákölteni. Amíg nincs itt minden korosztályból legalább egy, de azt mondom, több szerkesztő, a valóságot megközelítőleg sem fogja tükrözni a mondatok halmaza. És amíg a halmaz közelről sem tükrözi a valóságot, addig komolyan tanulni sem érdemes belőle. Az, hogy lesz-e valaha az oldalon annyi változatos, értelmes mondat, kérdéses.
