The brutality it endured from its previous owners is unconscionable. It needs discipline, not brutality. A owner who breaks a dog's spirit will never know true love from his dog. It will be fake and submissive. But that kind of owner doesn't really care; for them, a dog is a dog. I will wait 45 days and put a new collar on it, and then it will know that it is safe from its past abusers.

7501455	eng	Don't you think that you'll be able to solve the problem by yourselves?
7501456	eng	Don't sound so surprised. You know that I can do whatever I want to do.
7501457	eng	You didn't know you were the one who was supposed to do that, did you?

7501644	eng	I don't want any of my friends to know that I wasn't able to do that.
7501645	eng	I don't think that I could make up a story like that even if I tried.
7501646	eng	I didn't think Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him.
7501647	eng	I didn't know that you'd already bought me a drink. Now I've got two.

7501659	eng	You didn't know that you weren't supposed to do that today, did you?
7501660	eng	You didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that yesterday, did you?

7501676	eng	Tom said that he knew that he might have to do that on October 20th.

7501700	eng	The men that Tom robbed didn't tell anybody that they'd been robbed.
7501701	eng	It was clear that Tom was the one who was going to do that for Mary.
7501702	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't know that I wasn't going to do that.
7501703	eng	I'm pretty sure that I haven't done everything I was supposed to do.
7501704	eng	I'm not ashamed of my behavior, even though I know that I should be.
7501705	eng	I was the only one there who didn't know that Tom wanted to do that.
7501706	eng	I was the only one there who didn't know Tom used to live in Boston.
7501707	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't want him to be there.
7501708	eng	I think that Tom will likely spend the rest of his life behind bars.
7501709	eng	I think it might be dangerous for Tom and I to do that by ourselves.
7501710	eng	I know that you probably didn't really want to do that this morning.
7501711	eng	I know that Tom would tell Mary how to do that if she wanted him to.
7501712	eng	I know that Tom won't enjoy doing that as much as he thinks he will.

7501739	eng	I know Tom doesn't know how much time it'll take for him to do that.

7501747	eng	I knew Tom would be able to do that if he really put his mind to it.
7501748	eng	I knew Tom would be a good basketball coach. That's why I hired him.

7501751	eng	I knew Tom was a guitarist, but I didn't know he could play so well.
7501752	eng	I knew Tom had to finish writing the report before he could go home.
7501753	eng	I doubt that Tom will enjoy doing that as much as he thinks he will.
7501754	eng	I didn't know you were supposed to do that the day before yesterday.

7501762	eng	I didn't know I didn't have enough money to buy everything I needed.
7501763	eng	I could hear everything that Tom and Mary were saying to each other.
7501764	eng	Everybody seemed to already know Tom and Mary were getting divorced.
7501765	eng	Do you think that you'll be able to solve the problem by yourselves?
7501766	eng	Do you think that you can do that without getting yourselves killed?
7501767	eng	At first, I didn't notice Tom was missing a finger on his left hand.
7501768	eng	You should let Tom know you need to do that before you can go home.
7501769	eng	You should let Tom know Mary is going to try to do that by herself.
7501770	eng	You knew that Tom wasn't supposed to help Mary do that, didn't you?
7501771	eng	You didn't know that Tom wasn't supposed to do that today, did you?
7501772	eng	You didn't know I was the one who was supposed to do that, did you?
7501773	eng	You could've called and let me know that you were going to be late.
7501774	eng	You can't keep the ring that Tom gave you. You should give it back.
7501775	eng	You and I both know that Tom doesn't enjoy watching baseball on TV.
7501776	eng	We're the only ones here who know that Tom doesn't want to do that.
7501777	eng	We're the only ones here who know that Tom doesn't have to do that.
7501778	eng	We're the only ones here who know Tom already knows how to do that.
7501779	eng	Tom texted Mary to let her know he was going to be late for dinner.
7501780	eng	Tom spent some time looking at the pictures that Mary had sent him.
7501781	eng	Tom says that he knows a good Chinese restaurant that we can go to.
7501782	eng	Tom says he hopes Mary knows that she has to do that before Monday.
7501783	eng	Tom said that he'll probably go shopping with Mary on October 20th.

7501785	eng	Tom said that he thought that it would be better not to go outside.
7501786	eng	Tom said that he thought that Mary and John were going to break up.

7501796	eng	Tom realized that there was a good chance that he might get killed.
7501797	eng	Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to do that without some help.
7501798	eng	Tom is looking for someone to babysit his kids next Monday evening.
7501799	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows that she needs to do what John asks her to do.
7501800	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows that she has do whatever John tells her to do.
7501801	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows that she has do what John is asking her to do.
7501802	eng	Tom hopes Mary knows that she has do what John has asked her to do.
7501803	eng	Tom has decided he's not going to try to keep Mary from doing that.

7501807	eng	Tom has already decided he isn't going to go to Boston next summer.
7501808	eng	Tom doesn't hate Mary. He's just fallen in love with somebody else.
7501809	eng	Tom didn't seem to know that we were all going to Boston next week.
7501810	eng	Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't wearing the ring he'd given her.
7501811	eng	Tom didn't know the car parked in front of Mary's house was John's.
7501812	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wanted to do that when she was in Boston.
7501813	eng	Tom called his parents to let them know that he was in the hospital.
7501814	eng	Tom asked Mary to do something that she knew that she shouldn't do.
7501815	eng	Tom and I didn't know that we were supposed to do that before noon.
7501816	eng	The men that Tom robbed didn't tell anyone that they'd been robbed.
7501817	eng	The last time that Tom did that was when he was thirteen years old.
7501818	eng	It was clear that Tom wasn't going to do what Mary asked him to do.
7501819	eng	It was clear that Tom didn't know he didn't really need to do that.

7501821	eng	It was clear Tom didn't know that he didn't really need to do that.
7501822	eng	It was clear Tom didn't know that he didn't really have to do that.
7501823	eng	It might be dangerous for Tom and I to go skin diving by ourselves.

7501825	eng	I'm surprised that you didn't know that Tom didn't want to do that.

7501832	eng	I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to be there.
7501833	eng	I was pretty sure that Tom would be better at doing that than Mary.
7501834	eng	I think you should let Tom know that you don't want him to do that.
7501835	eng	I think that Tom wouldn't have done that if Mary hadn't been there.
7501836	eng	I think that Tom would be able to convince Mary to stop doing that.
7501837	eng	I think Tom wouldn't have told that joke if Mary hadn't been there.
7501838	eng	I reason Tom did that was because everybody else in his family did.

7501879	eng	I knew I shouldn't waste my time trying to convince Tom to help us.
7501880	eng	I knew I shouldn't waste my time trying to convince Tom to do that.
7501881	eng	I doubt that Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him.
7501882	eng	I doubt that Tom would be able to convince Mary to stop doing that.
7501883	eng	I don't yet know whether we'll be going to Boston on Monday or not.
7501884	eng	I don't that Tom would be able to convince Mary to stop doing that.
7501885	eng	I didn't want to go to Boston last week, but my boss said I had to.
7501886	eng	I didn't want any of my friends to know I had been arrested before.
7501887	eng	I didn't know you were planning to do that when you were in Boston.

7501902	eng	Didn't you know that Tom used to be a professional baseball player?
7501903	eng	At that time, I didn't know that we wouldn't be allowed to do that.
7501904	eng	Although Tom knew that Mary was married, he still flirted with her.
7501905	eng	You should let Tom know you don't need to do that until next week.
7501906	eng	You should let Tom know you don't have to do that until next year.
7501907	eng	You didn't know Tom wasn't supposed to help Mary do that, did you?
7501908	eng	You and I both know that you were the one who stole Tom's bicycle.
7501909	eng	We're the only ones here who know that Tom almost never does that.
7501910	eng	We're the only ones here who know Tom will be doing that tomorrow.
7501911	eng	We're the only ones here who know Tom and only Tom should do that.

7502185	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary didn't want to do that.
7502186	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary didn't need to do that.
7502187	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary didn't have to do that.
7502188	eng	Tom was surprised when Mary told him that she was only thirteen.
7502189	eng	Tom wants Mary to know that he won't be able to do that for her.
7502190	eng	Tom told me that he thought he was being followed by the police.
7502191	eng	Tom told me he thought that he was being followed by the police.
7502192	eng	Tom said that he thought that we needed to do that by ourselves.
7502193	eng	Tom said that he thought that it would be better not to do that.
7502194	eng	Tom said that he thought it would be better not to do that here.
7502195	eng	Tom said that he thought it would be better if I didn't do that.
7502196	eng	Tom said that he thought he wouldn't get there until after dark.
7502197	eng	Tom said that he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that.

7502200	eng	Tom said he thought there was no chance that Mary would do that.
7502201	eng	Tom said he thought that it would be better not to do that here.
7502202	eng	Tom said he thought that it would be better if I didn't do that.

7502206	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not need to do that on October 20th.
7502207	eng	Tom said he knew Mary might not have to do that on October 20th.
7502208	eng	Tom realized the car parked in front of Mary's house was John's.
7502209	eng	Tom realized he should apologize to Mary, but he didn't want to.
7502210	eng	Tom quickly realized that he wasn't going to be able to do that.
7502211	eng	Tom looked in the refrigerator, hoping to find something to eat.
7502212	eng	Tom knew that what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway.
7502213	eng	Tom isn't the only one who didn't know Mary had moved to Boston.
7502214	eng	Tom is still dating the same girl he was dating three years ago.
7502215	eng	Tom drank his cup of coffee and also drank Mary's cup of coffee.
7502216	eng	Tom didn't want any of his friends to know he was a drug dealer.
7502217	eng	Tom called his parents to let them know that he'd been arrested.
7502218	eng	Tom assumed that everybody knew that he wasn't going to do that.
7502219	eng	Tom assumed that everybody knew Mary couldn't understand French.
7502220	eng	Tom assumed everybody knew that Mary couldn't understand French.
7502221	eng	There was no way that I could've known that was going to happen.
7502222	eng	There was no way I could've known that that was going to happen.
7502223	eng	The reason Tom didn't do that was because Mary asked him not to.
7502224	eng	The reason I came here is to tell you that Tom has been injured.
7502225	eng	The guys hanging out in front of that store know that I'm a cop.
7502226	eng	No one at the party knew that Tom had just gotten out of prison.
7502227	eng	It was clear that Tom didn't really enjoy doing that by himself.
7502228	eng	It was clear Tom was the one who was going to do that with Mary.
7502229	eng	It was clear Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
7502230	eng	It was clear Tom didn't know we were the ones who had done that.
7502231	eng	If we thought we could prove that Tom did that, we'd arrest him.

7502233	eng	I'm surprised that you didn't know you were supposed to do that.

7502236	eng	I'm pretty sure I haven't done anything I wasn't supposed to do.
7502237	eng	I wonder whether Tom knew that Mary couldn't do that by herself.
7502238	eng	I told Tom Mary already knew he wasn't going to be at her party.
7502239	eng	I think that you should let Tom and I go to Boston by ourselves.
7502240	eng	I think that Tom would do practically anything to get Mary back.

7502623	eng	Tom isn't the one who told me that you didn't need to do that.

7502642	eng	Tom already knows that Mary will do that when she's in Boston.
7502643	eng	There was no way that I could've done that without Tom's help.
7502644	eng	The store that you're talking about is located on Park Street.
7502645	eng	The men that Tom robbed didn't tell anyone they'd been robbed.
7502646	eng	The men Tom robbed didn't tell anyone that they'd been robbed.
7502647	eng	The last time Tom did that was when he was thirteen years old.

7503017	eng	I doubt very seriously that Tom will be home on October 20th.
7503018	eng	I don't want that and I know that you don't want that either.
7503019	eng	I don't think that the way I feel about Tom will ever change.
7503020	eng	I don't think that Tom will be in his office on October 20th.

7503022	eng	I don't think that Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
7503023	eng	I don't think that Tom and Mary have to work on October 20th.

7503025	eng	I don't know if Tom will be going to Boston on Monday or not.
7503026	eng	I didn't want any of my friends to know I had been in prison.
7503027	eng	I didn't think you were going to be doing that by yourselves.
7503028	eng	I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that next winter.
7503029	eng	I didn't know you weren't planning on doing that by yourself.

7503032	eng	I didn't know that you would do that when you were in Boston.
7503033	eng	I didn't know that you were going to like doing that so much.
7503034	eng	I didn't know that you used to do that when you were younger.
7503035	eng	I didn't know that you expected me to do that this afternoon.

7503046	eng	I didn't know Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
7503047	eng	I didn't know Tom would be able to do that without some help.
7503048	eng	I didn't know Tom was the one who helped you paint the fence.
7503049	eng	I didn't know Tom didn't know anyone who was able to do that.
7503050	eng	I can't guarantee that Tom will do that, but I'll ask him to.
7503051	eng	I can't guarantee that I'll be able to do that, but I'll try.
7503052	eng	I can't afford to buy everything Tom wants me to buy for him.
7503053	eng	I called my wife to let her know that I'd be late for dinner.
7503054	eng	How do you think that Tom knew that we were going to be here?
7503055	eng	Do Tom and Mary know that you want to go to Boston with them?
7503056	eng	Didn't you know that Tom was going to go to Boston with Mary?
7503057	eng	You should let Tom know Mary is going to do that by herself.
7503058	eng	You ought to let Tom know Mary isn't going to be here today.
7503059	eng	You know Tom is still planning to move to Boston, don't you?

7503065	eng	Why don't you let Tom know you're going to do that tomorrow?
7503066	eng	Why don't you let Tom know that you aren't going to do that?
7503067	eng	Why didn't you tell me that you knew how to do that already?
7503068	eng	Why didn't you tell me that you already knew how to do that?
7503069	eng	We're the only ones here who know that Tom wants to do that.
7503070	eng	We're the only ones here who know that Tom always does that.

7503082	eng	Tom thought that Mary might have to do that on October 20th.

7503101	eng	Tom said he didn't need anybody to drive him to the airport.
7503102	eng	Tom realized that there was a good chance that he might die.
7503103	eng	Tom knew the car parked in front of Mary's house was John's.
7503104	eng	Tom knew that what he was going to do would make Mary angry.
7503105	eng	Tom knew he should apologize to Mary, but he didn't want to.
7503106	eng	Tom isn't the one who told me that I didn't need to do that.
7503107	eng	Tom isn't the one who told me that I didn't have to do that.
7503108	eng	Tom hoped the doctors would tell him he didn't need surgery.

7503125	eng	Tom asked Mary to pay him back everything that she owed him.
7503126	eng	Tom and Mary will be allowed to do anything they want to do.
7503127	eng	Tom and I didn't know we were supposed to do that yesterday.
7503128	eng	The only reason that Tom came was because Mary asked him to.
7503129	eng	It's possible that Tom may not know Mary is in the hospital.
7503130	eng	It was clear that Tom was expecting you to do that for Mary.

7503134	eng	It was clear Tom was going to be the one who had to do that.
7503135	eng	It might be dangerous for Tom and I to do that by ourselves.
7503136	eng	I've begun to realize that that isn't very likely to happen.
7503137	eng	I'm sure Tom is grateful for everything you've done for him.
7503138	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom didn't that I was going to do that.

7503145	eng	I wonder whether Tom knew Mary wanted to do that by herself.
7503146	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary wants to do that by herself.
7503147	eng	I want you to know that I appreciate all you've done for us.
7503148	eng	I want you to know that I appreciate all you've done for me.

7503159	eng	I realize that Tom could get injured if he tried to do that.
7503160	eng	I realize that Tom could get Mary to show us how to do that.
7503161	eng	I realize Tom could probably be finished doing that by 2:30.

7503163	eng	I know that you've got more important things to think about.
7503164	eng	I know that you're probably mad about what I said yesterday.

7503297	eng	I didn't know you wouldn't be able to do that with us today.
7503298	eng	I didn't know you wouldn't be able to do that by yourselves.

7503311	eng	I didn't know that we were supposed to do that before today.
7503312	eng	I didn't know that Tom wouldn't enjoy doing that by himself.
7503313	eng	I didn't know that Tom wouldn't be interested in doing that.
7503314	eng	I didn't know that Tom wouldn't be able to do that for Mary.
7503315	eng	I didn't know that Tom would have time to do that yesterday.
7503316	eng	I didn't know that Tom would be finished doing that by 2:30.
7503317	eng	I didn't know that Tom where when Mary was going to do that.
7503318	eng	I didn't know that Tom wasn't supposed to help Mary do that.
7503319	eng	I didn't know that Tom told Mary to ask John not to do that.
7503320	eng	I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
7503321	eng	I didn't know that Tom said that he wasn't going to do that.
7503322	eng	I didn't know that Tom knew why we couldn't do that for him.
7503323	eng	I didn't know that Tom knew why Mary didn't want to do that.
7503324	eng	I didn't know that Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
7503325	eng	I didn't know that Tom knew who was going to do that for us.

7503327	eng	I didn't know that Tom knew anybody who was able to do that.
7503328	eng	I didn't know that Tom didn't know any other way to do that.
7503329	eng	I didn't know that Tom and Mary were still living in Boston.
7503330	eng	I didn't know that Tom already knew about what had happened.
7503331	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't care if you did that by yourself.
7503332	eng	I didn't know Tom wouldn't care if Mary did that by herself.
7503333	eng	I didn't know Tom would like to be the first one to do that.
7503334	eng	I didn't know Tom would be interested in doing that with us.
7503335	eng	I didn't know Tom would be able to do that without our help.
7503336	eng	I didn't know Tom was the one who was going to sing tonight.
7503337	eng	I didn't know Tom was absent because he was in the hospital.
7503338	eng	I didn't know Tom told Mary that he wasn't going to do that.
7503339	eng	I didn't know I was supposed to do that before you got here.
7503340	eng	I didn't know I was supposed to do that before Tom got here.
7503341	eng	How in the world did you know that that was going to happen?
7503342	eng	How in the world did you know that Tom was going to do that?
7503343	eng	Don't forget that Tom is going to need your help doing that.
7503344	eng	Does Tom know that you've already talked to Mary about that?
7503345	eng	Didn't you know that both Tom and Mary don't like chocolate?
7503346	eng	Didn't you know Tom and Mary have both spent time in prison?
7503347	eng	Did you really not know that Tom was going to be here today?
7503348	eng	Did you know that it took Tom almost three hours to do that?
7503349	eng	You know that Tom isn't likely to do that today, don't you?
7503350	eng	You know that Tom and I aren't going to do that, don't you?
7503351	eng	You know both Tom and John are in love with you, don't you?
7503352	eng	You know Tom shouldn't be doing that by himself, don't you?
7503353	eng	You know Tom is still planning to join the team, don't you?
7503354	eng	You know Tom and John are both in love with you, don't you?
7503355	eng	You didn't know that you were supposed to do that, did you?
7503356	eng	You didn't know that Tom thought I should do that, did you?
7503357	eng	You didn't know that Tom had to help Mary do that, did you?
7503358	eng	You can't keep the ring Tom gave you. You should return it.
7503359	eng	Why don't you let Tom know you can take care of yourselves?
7503360	eng	Why didn't you tell me that you didn't know how to do that?
7503361	eng	We know that Tom is unlikely to do that unless we help him.
7503362	eng	We didn't know we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
7503363	eng	Tom wiped his mouth with the towel that Mary handed to him.
7503364	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary wanted to do that.
7503365	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary shouldn't do that.
7503366	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary needed to do that.
7503367	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary didn't want to do that.
7503368	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary didn't need to do that.
7503369	eng	Tom wasn't the one who told me Mary didn't have to do that.
7503370	eng	Tom was surprised when Mary told him she was only thirteen.
7503371	eng	Tom was forced to do some things that he didn't want to do.
7503372	eng	Tom wants Mary to know he won't be able to do that for her.
7503373	eng	Tom told me he thought he was being followed by the police.
7503374	eng	Tom told everybody that he was good friends with the mayor.
7503375	eng	Tom told everybody that he didn't know how to speak French.
7503376	eng	Tom told Mary that he thought that John had been surprised.
7503377	eng	Tom thinks that Mary will be in her office on October 20th.
7503378	eng	Tom thinks that Mary always packs too much in her suitcase.
7503379	eng	Tom talks to almost everybody that he passes on the street.
7503380	eng	Tom says he knows that Mary will have to help John do that.
7503381	eng	Tom says he knows that Mary will have to do that next week.
7503382	eng	Tom said that he'd be going back to Boston on October 20th.
7503383	eng	Tom said that he wasn't able to find a decent play to stay.
7503384	eng	Tom said that he wanted to leave his children here with us.
7503385	eng	Tom said that he thought we needed to do that by ourselves.
7503386	eng	Tom said that he thought that that wasn't likely to happen.
7503387	eng	Tom said that he thought that Mary would enjoy the concert.
7503388	eng	Tom said that he thought it would be better not to do that.
7503389	eng	Tom said that he probably wouldn't be busy on October 20th.
7503390	eng	Tom said that he expected Mary to get home on October 20th.
7503391	eng	Tom said he thought that we needed to do that by ourselves.
7503392	eng	Tom said he thought that it would be better not to do that.
7503393	eng	Tom said he thought it would be better not to do that here.
7503394	eng	Tom said he thought it would be better if I didn't do that.
7503395	eng	Tom said he thought he wouldn't get there until after dark.
7503396	eng	Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that.
7503397	eng	Tom said he didn't need anyone to drive him to the airport.
7503398	eng	Tom realized that he was the person who had to rescue Mary.
7503399	eng	Tom quickly realized that what he was doing wasn't working.
7503400	eng	Tom quickly realized he wasn't going to be able to do that.
7503401	eng	Tom never forgets to send a birthday present to his father.
7503402	eng	Tom made many suggestions, but none of them were very good.
7503403	eng	Tom lives in the same apartment building as his parents do.
7503404	eng	Tom has already decided that he's going to try to fix that.
7503405	eng	Tom dried his hands with the towel that Mary handed to him.
7503406	eng	Tom doesn't like people to know he can't speak French well.
7503407	eng	Tom didn't want Mary to know he didn't know how to do that.
7503408	eng	Tom didn't tell anybody that he was planning on doing that.
7503409	eng	Tom didn't know that you weren't supposed to do that today.
7503410	eng	Tom didn't know that we were the ones who did that for him.
7503411	eng	Tom didn't know that Mary wasn't the one who cooked dinner.
7503412	eng	Tom didn't know he was the one who was supposed to do that.
7503413	eng	Tom didn't have a girlfriend until he was thirty years old.
7503414	eng	Tom couldn't believe that his vacation was over so quickly.
7503415	eng	Tom called his parents to let them know he'd been arrested.
7503416	eng	Tom assumed that everybody knew he wasn't going to do that.
7503417	eng	Tom assumed everybody knew that he wasn't going to do that.
7503418	eng	Tom assumed everybody knew Mary couldn't understand French.
7503419	eng	Tom asked Mary to tell John that he didn't plan to do that.
7503420	eng	There's a chance that Tom won't be at work on October 20th.
7503421	eng	There was no way I could've known that was going to happen.
7503422	eng	There was no way I could've known Tom was going to do that.
7503423	eng	The reason that Tom did that was because Mary asked him to.
7503424	eng	The reason I came here is to tell you Tom has been injured.
7503425	eng	Nobody at the party knew Tom had just gotten out of prison.
7503426	eng	No one at the party knew Tom had just gotten out of prison.
7503427	eng	Neither Tom nor Mary has done what everybody else has done.
7503428	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know that I don't often do that nowadays.
7503429	eng	Many people don't know all their great-grandparents' names.
7503430	eng	Make sure that Tom doesn't do what he's not supposed to do.
7503431	eng	It was clear that Tom was supposed to do that this morning.
7503432	eng	It was clear that Tom was expecting you to do that for him.
7503433	eng	It was clear Tom didn't really enjoy doing that by himself.
7503434	eng	If we thought we could prove Tom did that, we'd arrest him.
7503435	eng	I'm surprised you didn't know you were supposed to do that.
7503436	eng	I'm surprised you didn't know that Tom was in the hospital.
7503437	eng	I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
7503438	eng	I'm sure you can find something to eat in the refrigerator.
7503439	eng	I'm pretty sure that Tom has never seen anything like that.
7503440	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom and Mary have both finished doing that.
7503441	eng	I'll never forget the first time that I saw Tom doing that.
7503442	eng	I wonder whether or not Tom knows what Mary's phone number is.
7503443	eng	I wonder whether Tom knew Mary couldn't do that by herself.
7503444	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary ate both of his sandwiches.
7503445	eng	I want you to know that you've got nothing to be afraid of.
7503446	eng	I want you to know that I'm willing to help if you need me.
7503447	eng	I want to let Tom know he doesn't need to be here tomorrow.
7503448	eng	I want to know how you knew that Tom was going to be there.
7503449	eng	I think you should let Tom and I go to Boston by ourselves.
7503450	eng	I think that you should let Tom and I do that by ourselves.
7503451	eng	I think that this picture was taken about three months ago.
7503452	eng	I think that Tom knows how much time he'll need to do that.
7503453	eng	I think that Tom is about three years younger than Mary is.
7503454	eng	I think Tom would do practically anything to get Mary back.
7503455	eng	I think I can explain that so that even Tom can understand.
7503456	eng	I realize that Tom would help me do that if I asked him to.
7503457	eng	I realize that Tom could probably convince Mary to do that.
7503458	eng	I let Tom know I wasn't happy with the way he was behaving.
7503459	eng	I know you probably didn't really want to do that with Tom.
7503460	eng	I know you aren't planning on staying here for a long time.
7503461	eng	I know that you've been in Boston for the past three years.

7505036	eng	Most of Tom's friends know he's a recovering alcoholic.
7505037	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary isn't the one who did that.
7505038	eng	It was clear that Tom didn't plan to do that yesterday.
7505039	eng	It was clear Tom was expecting you to do that for Mary.
7505040	eng	It was clear Tom was expecting Mary to do that for him.
7505041	eng	It was clear Tom and Mary were in love with each other.
7505042	eng	I've never loved anybody as much as much as I love Tom.
7505043	eng	I've begun to realize that isn't very likely to happen.
7505044	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I was going to do that.
7505045	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I was going to be here.
7505046	eng	I'm pretty sure I haven't done everything I need to do.
7505047	eng	I'm glad that what happened to Tom didn't happen to me.
7505048	eng	I wonder whether or not Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
7505049	eng	I wonder whether Tom knows that Mary is coming with us.
7505050	eng	I wonder whether Tom knew Mary needed to do that today.
7505051	eng	I wonder if Tom knows that Mary has to do that by 2:30.

7505053	eng	I wasn't the one who told Tom that he couldn't do that.
7505054	eng	I was the only one there who knew that Tom was unhappy.
7505055	eng	I was asked to do some things that I didn't want to do.
7505056	eng	I want you to know I appreciate all you've done for me.
7505057	eng	I thought Tom would like to be the next one to do that.
