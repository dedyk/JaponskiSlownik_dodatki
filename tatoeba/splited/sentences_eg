5851486	eng	I've already explained that to Tom.
5851487	eng	I hope that didn't offend you.
5851488	eng	I like teaching, too.
5851489	eng	Have I said anything that isn't true?
5851490	eng	I was prepared.
5851491	eng	They've made improvements.
5851492	eng	I try to never complain about the food.
5851493	eng	I'll wait here until Tom gets here.
5851494	eng	I hope they catch the shooter.
5851495	eng	I let everybody down.
5851496	eng	Have you finally finished doing that?
5851497	eng	I was poisoned.
5851498	eng	They wouldn't let me sing.
5851499	eng	I was healthy up until three years ago.
5851500	eng	I was the one who made Tom do that.
5851501	eng	I hope they get it fixed soon.
5851502	eng	I insisted on paying.
5851503	eng	How are they going to get that fixed?
5851504	eng	I was outraged.
5851505	eng	They walked home together.
5851506	eng	I was hoping we could do that together.
5851507	eng	I was surprised that Tom said that.
5851508	eng	I hope this advice is helpful.
5851509	eng	I have a lot of cats.
5851510	eng	How are they going to prove anything?
5851511	eng	I was obedient.
5851512	eng	They didn't want me there.
5851513	eng	I wasn't ready to do that at that time.
5851514	eng	I think Tom wouldn't be happy here.
5851515	eng	I just can't thank you enough.
5851516	eng	I failed three times.
5851517	eng	How are you dealing with the problem?
5851518	eng	I was left out.
5851519	eng	That's not worth the risk.
5851520	eng	I wish you could've been there with me.
5851521	eng	I sometimes help Tom in the garden.
5851522	eng	I just didn't want to do that.
5851523	eng	I do a lot of skiing.
5851524	eng	How are you enjoying the trip so far?
5851525	eng	I was laid off.
5851526	eng	That's not worth our time.
5851527	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to stay here.
5851528	eng	I owe Tom a real debt of gratitude.
5851529	eng	I just didn't want to give up.
5851530	eng	I cut my hair myself.
5851531	eng	How are you going to cook the turkey?
5851532	eng	I was inspired.
5851533	eng	That's just how I like it.
5851534	eng	I'm planning to go skiing next weekend.
5851535	eng	I never told Tom much about myself.
5851536	eng	I just don't have enough time.
5851537	eng	I can't tell you why.
5851538	eng	How are you going to pay for college?
5851539	eng	I was in agony.
5851540	eng	That's just an accusation.
5851541	eng	I've already told you that three times.
5851542	eng	I might be able to do that for Tom.
5851543	eng	I just don't have that choice.
5851544	eng	I've found the leak.
5851545	eng	How can I be sure I'm doing it right?
5851546	eng	I was homesick.
5851547	eng	That was very scary to me.
5851548	eng	I've been dealing with major back pain.
5851549	eng	I know both Tom and Mary very well.
5851550	eng	I just don't think it's right.
5851551	eng	I've been fortunate.
5851552	eng	How can I delete photos from my iPad?
5851553	eng	I was gullible.
5851554	eng	That never occurred to me.
5851555	eng	I've caused you enough trouble already.
5851556	eng	I haven't seen Tom since breakfast.
5851557	eng	I just had the carpet cleaned.
5851558	eng	I'm pretty athletic.
5851559	eng	How can you tell which one is a fake?
5851560	eng	I was ecstatic.
5851561	eng	Please don't make me sing.
5851562	eng	I've never seen Mary this upset before.
5851563	eng	I had a long talk with Tom tonight.
5851564	eng	I just wish I could get a job.
5851565	eng	I'm not that naïve.
5851566	eng	How could I expect you to understand?
5851567	eng	I was discreet.
5851568	eng	Our team is likely to win.
5851569	eng	I almost always eat breakfast by myself.
5851570	eng	I found my bike behind Tom's house.
5851571	eng	I knew I had to buy something.
5851572	eng	I'm not eating that.
5851573	eng	How could they have gotten that idea?
5851574	eng	I was deported.
5851575	eng	Mary's dress is too short.
5851576	eng	I always call my mother on her birthday.
5851577	eng	I don't want to be too hard on Tom.
5851578	eng	I knew both of them very well.
5851579	eng	I'm not a terrorist.
5851580	eng	How could you wait in line that long?
5851581	eng	I was defeated.
5851582	eng	Mary screamed and fainted.
5851583	eng	I always dreamed of being a billionaire.
5851584	eng	I don't shave as often as Tom does.
5851585	eng	I knew it was going to happen.
5851586	eng	I'm not a good cook.
5851587	eng	How did you acquire that information?
5851588	eng	I was abducted.
5851589	eng	Mary is prettier than you.
5851590	eng	I don't care what people think about me.
5851591	eng	I don't like the way Tom does that.
5851592	eng	I knew that this would happen.
5851593	eng	I'm not a barbarian.
5851594	eng	How did you do that without any help?
5851595	eng	I wanted money.
5851596	eng	Mary is a wonderful woman.
5851597	eng	I don't know anyone who lives in Boston.
5851598	eng	I didn't like the way Tom did that.
5851599	eng	I knew you would do something.
5851600	eng	I'm no longer bored.
5851601	eng	How did you get started in wrestling?
5851602	eng	I wanted a job.
5851603	eng	Let's not eat out tonight.
5851604	eng	I don't know anyone who plays the banjo.
5851605	eng	Did Tom bring anybody to the party?
5851606	eng	I know I could've done better.
5851607	eng	I'm kind of thirsty.
5851608	eng	How did you know I wanted to do that?
5851609	eng	I want updates.
5851610	eng	Let's not do this anymore.
5851611	eng	I don't like riding a bicycle very much.
5851612	eng	Are you going to break up with Tom?
5851613	eng	I know I was wrong about that.
5851614	eng	I'm a bit skeptical.
5851615	eng	How did you know who to give that to?
5851616	eng	I want results.
5851617	eng	Let's have lunch together.
5851618	eng	I forgot to give you back your umbrella.
5851619	eng	Tom thinks that Mary will do that.
5851620	eng	I know better than to do that.
5851621	eng	I'll dance with you.
5851622	eng	How do I get to the American Embassy?
5851623	eng	I walk quickly.
5851624	eng	It's difficult to do that.
5851625	eng	I forgot to return your umbrella to you.
5851626	eng	Tom says he understood everything.
5851627	eng	I know it was partly my fault.
5851628	eng	I watch a lot of TV.
5851629	eng	How do you decide what songs to play?
5851630	eng	I took the job.
5851631	eng	It's difficult to analyze.
5851632	eng	I got better after taking that medicine.
5851633	eng	Tom didn't invite me to his party.
5851634	eng	I know you're being sarcastic.
5851635	eng	I was too ambitious.
5851636	eng	How do you enforce these regulations?
5851637	eng	I took a break.
5851638	eng	It's been cloudy all week.
5851639	eng	I haven't eaten any meat in a long time.
5851640	eng	Tom didn't ask any more questions.
5851641	eng	I left Boston three years ago.
5851642	eng	I tried to stand up.
5851643	eng	How do you prove something like that?
5851644	eng	I talked a lot.
5851645	eng	It wasn't really so scary.
5851646	eng	I haven't had a vacation in a long time.
5851647	eng	I was like Tom when I was his age.
5851648	eng	I lived there for a few years.
5851649	eng	I sometimes stutter.
5851650	eng	How hard can it really be to do that?
5851651	eng	I studied hard.
5851652	eng	It was pretty spectacular.
5851653	eng	I knew I had to do something about that.
5851654	eng	I moved as quickly as I could.
5851655	eng	I seldom wear a hat.
5851656	eng	How has motherhood changed your life?
5851657	eng	I stole a boat.
5851658	eng	It was a great experience.
5851659	eng	I need to find a way to get out of here.
5851660	eng	I wanted to go to Boston with Tom.
5851661	eng	I must agree with you on this.
5851662	eng	I seldom skip meals.
5851663	eng	How have your reading habits changed?
5851664	eng	I stole a base.
5851665	eng	Go back home to Australia.
5851666	eng	I thought you would be there last night.
5851667	eng	I now know why Tom didn't like me.
5851668	eng	I never was much of a swimmer.
5851669	eng	I often shop online.
5851670	eng	How large will the price increase be?
5851671	eng	I stayed quiet.
5851672	eng	Do you think I look happy?
5851673	eng	I tried to run away, but they caught me.
5851674	eng	I never told Tom that I liked him.
5851675	eng	I said good night to everyone.
5851676	eng	I often read in bed.
5851677	eng	How long do I have to think about it?
5851678	eng	I shut the lid.
5851679	eng	Did you change the filter?
5851680	eng	I was just trying to do the right thing.
5851681	eng	I never asked Tom what he thought.
5851682	eng	I seldom visit Boston anymore.
5851683	eng	I never was unlucky.
5851684	eng	How long do you plan to keep working?
5851685	eng	I should relax.
5851686	eng	All the children like you.
5851687	eng	I would cry, too, if that happened to me.
5851688	eng	I haven't seen much of Tom lately.
5851689	eng	I spoke as quietly as I could.
5851690	eng	I needed more money.
5851691	eng	How long have you lived in Australia?
5851692	eng	I should be OK.
5851693	eng	You're half an hour late.
5851694	eng	I'd like for you to do something for me.
5851695	eng	I don't know anyone who likes Tom.
5851696	eng	I stepped back from the cliff.
5851697	eng	I might not do that.
5851698	eng	How long will it take you to do that?
5851699	eng	I scream a lot.
5851700	eng	You won't mind, will you?
5851701	eng	I'd like to do that as soon as possible.
5851702	eng	I always let Tom do what he wants.
5851703	eng	I think I'm going to die soon.
5851704	eng	I may still do that.
5851705	eng	How many people would have done that?
5851706	eng	I scare easily.
5851707	eng	You must be really tired.
5851708	eng	I'll do whatever I can to make it right.
5851709	eng	Have you ever seen Tom doing that?
5851710	eng	I think we can do it tomorrow.
5851711	eng	I like strawberries.
5851712	eng	How many times have you been burgled?
5851713	eng	I saw a doctor.
5851714	eng	Why can't we do that now?
5851715	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to please you.
5851716	eng	I think we're the better team.
5851717	eng	I knew this already.
5851718	eng	How many years have you played rugby?
5851719	eng	I sat on a log.
5851720	eng	Who said I wouldn't help?
5851721	eng	I'm not always as polite as I should be.
5851722	eng	Tom used to get advice from Mary.
5851723	eng	I think we've had a good year.
5851724	eng	I have news for you.
5851725	eng	How much did you pay for those shoes?
5851726	eng	I said goodbye.
5851727	eng	What do you plan to sell?
5851728	eng	I'm not opposed to going back to Boston.
5851729	eng	Tom told me all about his family.
5851730	eng	I think you did it on purpose.
5851731	eng	I drove myself home.
5851732	eng	How much difference can one man make?
5851733	eng	I rented a car.
5851734	eng	What do we need that for?
5851735	eng	I'm pretty sure I can do this by myself.
5851736	eng	Tom thought Mary worked for John.
5851737	eng	I thought it was kind of cool.
5851738	eng	I don't often smile.
5851739	eng	How much do we have to pay to get in?
5851740	eng	I ran for help.
5851741	eng	We've been working on it.
5851742	eng	I'm too old to wear something like that.
5851743	eng	Tom thinks he's better than Mary.
5851744	eng	I thought maybe I should stop.
5851745	eng	I caught three fish.
5851746	eng	How much do you know about Australia?
5851747	eng	I put on a tie.
5851748	eng	We're all pretty excited.
5851750	eng	Tom said he thought I'm charming.
5851751	eng	I thought that was well known.
5851752	eng	I can run very fast.
5851753	eng	How much do you know about terrorism?
5851754	eng	I plan to move.
5851755	eng	We used to do that a lot.
5851756	eng	I've been awake for three hours already.
5851757	eng	Tom repeated what I said to Mary.
5851758	eng	I totally agree with you both.
5851759	eng	I've been disloyal.
5851760	eng	How much does a three-year old weigh?
5851761	eng	I painted that.
5851762	eng	They've already fixed it.
5851763	eng	I've drunk three cups of coffee already.
5851764	eng	Tom never said he wasn't married.
5851765	eng	I tried to be more aggressive.
5851766	eng	I'm seldom at home.
5851767	eng	How much has this cost the taxpayers?
5851768	eng	I now know why.
5851769	eng	They don't want to leave.
5851770	eng	I've never been to Boston in the winter.
5851771	eng	Tom is rumored to be dating Mary.
5851772	eng	I walked so much my feet hurt.
5851773	eng	I'm not very smart.
5851774	eng	How much is this party going to cost?
5851775	eng	I need glasses.
5851776	eng	That was very gratifying.
5851777	eng	I always try to wear fashionable clothes.
5851778	eng	Tom is particularly kind to Mary.
5851779	eng	I was allowed to go with them.
5851780	eng	I'm not very brave.
5851781	eng	How much longer do I have to do this?
5851782	eng	I may not come.
5851783	eng	Shut up and listen to me.
5851784	eng	I can't remember what I'm supposed to do.
5851785	eng	Tom is falling in love with Mary.
5851786	eng	I was just trying to be smart.
5851787	eng	I'm not infallible.
5851788	eng	How much longer do I need to do this?
5851789	eng	I made partner.
5851790	eng	Please get out of my way.
5851791	eng	I don't know anyone who can speak French.
5851792	eng	Tom is currently married to Mary.
5851793	eng	I was just trying to be tough.
5851794	eng	I'm not a murderer.
5851795	eng	How much will a graduate degree cost?
5851796	eng	I made a noise.
5851797	eng	Mary's dress is too long.
5851798	eng	I don't see how I can ever do that again.
5851799	eng	Tom has blue eyes and curly hair.
5851800	eng	I was one of the unlucky ones.
5851801	eng	I'm not a gangster.
5851802	eng	How temporary will this situation be?
5851803	eng	I loved school.
5851804	eng	Mary is wearing a brooch.
5851805	eng	I don't think I've changed all that much.
5851806	eng	Tom has a bit of a crush on Mary.
5851807	eng	I was pleased with the result.
5851808	eng	I'm not a crackpot.
5851809	eng	How that happened is a mystery to me.
5851810	eng	I love to fish.
5851811	eng	Mary is knitting a scarf.
5851812	eng	I don't want to think about those things.
5851813	eng	Tom handed the newspaper to Mary.
5851814	eng	I was pretty excited about it.
5851815	eng	I'm not a comedian.
5851816	eng	People don't forget things like that.
5851817	eng	I love singing.
5851818	eng	Mary is getting prettier.
5851819	eng	I haven't done that since I was thirteen.
5851820	eng	Tom does look lonely, doesn't he?
5851821	eng	I was pretty happy about that.
5851822	eng	I'm kind of sleepy.
5851823	eng	The problem still hasn't been solved.
5851824	eng	I love fishing.
5851825	eng	Mary is a charming woman.
5851826	eng	I know that you won't be able to do that.
5851827	eng	Tom can be just as tough as Mary.
5851828	eng	I was scared and stressed out.
5851829	eng	I'm in a big hurry.
5851830	eng	We're going to miss you an awful lot.
5851831	eng	I looked at it.
5851832	eng	Let's walk home together.
5851833	eng	I often wear blue jeans and a blue shirt.
5851834	eng	Tom arrived the day before I did.
5851835	eng	I was sure I was going to die.
5851836	eng	I'm here all alone.
5851837	eng	Will you explain what the trouble is?
5851838	eng	I lit the oven.
5851839	eng	Let's not go there today.
5851840	eng	I think the audience thought I was funny.
5851841	eng	Tom also has a sister named Mary.
5851842	eng	I was very busy all last week.
5851843	eng	I'm already in bed.
5851844	eng	Do you plan to attend today's meeting?
5851845	eng	I lit the fuse.
5851846	eng	Last night was very cold.
5851847	eng	I took a cookie off the plate and ate it.
5851848	eng	I'm glad Tom is going to college.
5851849	eng	I wasn't ready to be a father.
5851850	eng	I'm a student here.
5851851	eng	Don't forget to wash behind your ears.
5851852	eng	I lit the fire.
5851853	eng	It certainly wasn't easy.
5851854	eng	I was hoping we wouldn't need to do that.
5851855	eng	I'm doing what Tom told me to do.
5851856	eng	I wasn't sure what that meant.
5851857	eng	I'm a patient here.
5851858	eng	How am I going to remember to do that?
5851859	eng	I like writing.
5851860	eng	Have you found a job yet?
5851861	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to be with you.
5851862	eng	I understood everything Tom said.
5851863	eng	I wear a tie almost every day.
5851864	eng	I was really drunk.
5851865	eng	How are they going to do that exactly?
5851866	eng	I like winning.
5851867	eng	Everybody wanted to sing.
5851868	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to keep my job.
5851869	eng	I know his middle name isn't Tom.
5851870	eng	I won't be at school tomorrow.
5851871	eng	I should be in bed.
5851872	eng	How are we going to make a difference?
5851873	eng	I like to knit.
5851874	eng	Do you think I look pale?
5851875	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to protect you.
5851876	eng	Do you think Tom knew about that?
5851877	eng	I won't give you any medicine.
5851878	eng	I seldom get angry.
5851879	eng	How can we find out what's causing it?
5851880	eng	I like to hunt.
5851881	eng	Do you think I look cool?
5851882	eng	I'm only doing what I've been told to do.
5851883	eng	You'd better see what Tom wants.
5851884	eng	I won't listen to you anymore.
5851885	eng	I pulled the lever.
5851886	eng	How come we've never done this before?
5851887	eng	I like to draw.
5851888	eng	Did you sing by yourself?
5851889	eng	I've already arranged for that to happen.
5851890	eng	What sort of man is Tom Jackson?
5851891	eng	I wonder what they'll do next.
5851892	eng	I often wear boots.
5851893	eng	How could I not have known it was you?
5851894	eng	I like to bowl.
5851895	eng	Can you guess what it is?
5851896	eng	I've already done everything I was supposed to do.
5851897	eng	What did Tom do that was so bad?
5851898	eng	I would say the worst is over.
5851899	eng	I often wear black.
5851900	eng	How could you let them do this to you?
5851901	eng	I like surfing.
5851902	eng	Are you going to do that?
5851903	eng	I almost always eat oatmeal for breakfast.
5851904	eng	Tom's French has improved a lot.
5851905	eng	I wouldn't quit if I were you.
5851906	eng	I often wear a hat.
5851907	eng	How did you get interested in finance?
5851908	eng	I like lobster.
5851909	eng	You should stop singing.
5851910	eng	I almost died last year in a car accident.
5851911	eng	Tom wouldn't even speak to Mary.
5851912	eng	I'll be back in about a month.
5851913	eng	I often go fishing.
5851914	eng	How did your meeting with the boss go?
5851915	eng	I like it, too.
5851916	eng	When is it going to end?
5851917	eng	I always sit in the back of the classroom.
5851918	eng	Tom wasn't the one who did that.
5851919	eng	I'll die if you don't tell me.
5851920	eng	I never wear a tie.
5851921	eng	How difficult was it at the beginning?
5851922	eng	I like hunting.
5851923	eng	What's unique about you?
5851924	eng	I didn't grow up doing this kind of thing.
5851925	eng	Tom was quite impressed by Mary.
5851926	eng	I'll get you something to eat.
5851927	eng	I never wear a hat.
5851928	eng	How do you come up with these designs?
5851929	eng	I like farming.
5851930	eng	What's there to discuss?
5851931	eng	I expected to pay at least thirty dollars.
5851932	eng	Tom was just as excited as Mary.
5851933	eng	I'll give it to you right now.
5851934	eng	I never was skinny.
5851935	eng	How do you deal with those challenges?
5851936	eng	I like carrots.
5851937	eng	What's the real problem?
5851938	eng	I got a haircut on the way home from work.
5851939	eng	Tom wanted to name his son John.
5851940	eng	I'll let you know what I hear.
5851941	eng	I like Boston, too.
5851942	eng	How do you know it won't happen again?
5851943	eng	I like camping.
5851944	eng	What's the matter, dear?
5851945	eng	I hardly ever mispronounce people's names.
5851946	eng	Tom says that's where he put it.
5851947	eng	I'll tell you the whole story.
5851948	eng	I hope I'll fit in.
5851949	eng	How do you know they aren't Canadians?
5851950	eng	I like blondes.
5851951	eng	What's the asking price?
5851952	eng	I have problems, just like everybody else.
5851953	eng	Tom said he thought I was witty.
5851954	eng	I'll try to have fun tomorrow.
5851955	eng	I have your number.
5851956	eng	How hard is it to get a fake passport?
5851957	eng	I left on time.
5851958	eng	What's that machine for?
5851959	eng	I hope you're not hiding anything from us.
5851960	eng	Tom knows he's better than Mary.
5851961	eng	I'm always going to work hard.
5851962	eng	I enjoy doing that.
5851963	eng	How has the Internet changed your job?
5851964	eng	I kept yelling.
5851965	eng	What's that green stuff?
5851966	eng	I left the lights on all night last night.
5851967	eng	Tom is nicer to me than Mary is.
5851968	eng	I'm doing everything I can do.
5851969	eng	I don't have a son.
5851970	eng	How long would it take you to do that?
5851971	eng	I kept walking.
5851972	eng	What'll this accomplish?
5851973	eng	I lived with the Jacksons for three years.
5851974	eng	Tom is better-looking than John.
5851975	eng	I'm doing everything possible.
5851976	eng	I did it correctly.
5851977	eng	How many employees have your laid off?
5851978	eng	I kept texting.
5851979	eng	What happened on Monday?
5851980	eng	I often play my guitar on the front porch.
5851981	eng	Tom and Mary have adopted twins.
5851982	eng	I'm getting to be a good cook.
5851983	eng	I can't retire yet.
5851984	eng	How many of you are afraid of spiders?
5851985	eng	I kept talking.
5851986	eng	What do our guests want?
5851987	eng	I often stay in bed until noon on Sundays.
5851988	eng	The first person we saw was Tom.
5851989	eng	I'm glad it happened this way.
5851990	eng	I always work hard.
5851991	eng	How many passengers are on this plane?
5851992	eng	I kept staring.
5851993	eng	We're taking a big risk.
5851994	eng	I plan to retire when I'm sixty years old.
5851995	eng	I'm sorry Tom isn't coming back.
5851996	eng	I'm glad it's all working out.
5851997	eng	I've never skated.
5851998	eng	How many people died in that accident?
5851999	eng	I kept smiling.
5852000	eng	We're not all Canadians.
5852001	eng	I wanted to live in Boston with my family.
5852002	eng	I was irritated by what Tom did.
5852003	eng	I'm glad we're still doing it.
5852004	eng	I'm not very tall.
5852005	eng	How many trips did you take last year?
5852006	eng	I kept singing.
5852007	eng	We're all pretty hungry.
5852008	eng	I was a plumber before I became a teacher.
5852009	eng	I thought Tom looked pretty mad.
5852010	eng	I'm going to enjoy being here.
5852011	eng	I'm not a fascist.
5852012	eng	How many vacations do you have a year?
5852013	eng	I kept running.
5852014	eng	We often talk about you.
5852015	eng	I was just about to make the same comment.
5852016	eng	I laugh a lot when I'm with Tom.
5852017	eng	I'm happy with what I've seen.
5852018	eng	I'm not a crybaby.
5852019	eng	How much did your school uniform cost?
5852020	eng	I kept pushing.
5852021	eng	They say I'm a war hero.
5852022	eng	I knew better than to trust Tom.
5852023	eng	I'm just glad no one got hurt.
5852024	eng	I'm a picky eater.
5852025	eng	How much is your comfort worth to you?
5852026	eng	I kept playing.
5852027	eng	The brake's not working.
5852028	eng	I always got up early when I was a student.
5852029	eng	I hope that Tom will marry Mary.
5852030	eng	I'm just glad no one was hurt.
5852031	eng	I'm a doctor here.
5852032	eng	How much money did that cost to build?
5852033	eng	I kept packing.
5852034	eng	That's impossible to do.
5852035	eng	I forgot to lock the front door last night.
5852036	eng	I have no idea why Tom did that.
5852037	eng	I'm not doing this for myself.
5852038	eng	I'm a big boy now.
5852039	eng	How much time and money would we save?
5852040	eng	I kept focused.
5852041	eng	That should be possible.
5852042	eng	I have a grandson and three granddaughters.
5852043	eng	I didn't want to show it to Tom.
5852044	eng	I'm not even going to comment.
5852045	eng	I won't accept it.
5852046	eng	How on earth could this be a surprise?
5852047	eng	I kept driving.
5852048	eng	That might be dangerous.
5852049	eng	I haven't yet done what needs to be done.
5852050	eng	I didn't talk to Tom about that.
5852051	eng	I'm not going to be a yes man.
5852052	eng	I was my own boss.
5852053	eng	How soon do you expect that to happen?
5852054	eng	I kept digging.
5852055	eng	Thanks for posting this.
5852056	eng	I need help moving this table into my room.
5852057	eng	I could hurt Tom if I wanted to.
5852058	eng	I'm not opposed to doing that.
5852059	eng	I sure am thirsty.
5852060	eng	How will you be spending your weekend?
5852061	eng	I just came in.
5852062	eng	Perhaps I should resign.
5852063	eng	I often watch the news while eating dinner.
5852064	eng	You waited for Tom, didn't you?
5852065	eng	I'm off to a late start today.
5852066	eng	I seldom get sick.
5852067	eng	No one told me what I should be doing.
5852068	eng	I helped a lot.
5852069	eng	Nobody knows what to do.
5852070	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to make it right.
5852071	eng	Why don't you get married, Tom?
5852072	eng	I'm old enough to know better.
5852073	eng	I seldom eat meat.
5852074	eng	That wasn't what I expected to happen.
5852075	eng	I have the flu.
5852076	eng	No one likes to do that.
5852077	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to reach the top.
5852078	eng	What'll happen to Tom and Mary?
5852079	eng	I'm prepared to talk about it.
5852080	eng	I never wear pink.
5852081	eng	That's just not going to happen today.
5852082	eng	I have my keys.
5852083	eng	Mary isn't so beautiful.
5852084	eng	I'll never forget what you just did for me.
5852085	eng	Tom was here one day last week.
5852086	eng	I'm pretty good at doing that.
5852087	eng	I need a new coat.
5852088	eng	There's a lot of room for improvement.
5852089	eng	I have company.
5852090	eng	Mary is a capable nurse.
5852091	eng	I'm getting tired of living here by myself.
5852092	eng	Tom used to be engaged to Mary.
5852093	eng	I'm really not happy about it.
5852094	eng	I loved them both.
5852095	eng	There's no way that's going to happen.
5852096	eng	I have a ranch.
5852097	eng	Let me help you do that.
5852098	eng	I'm sure your parents must be proud of you.
5852099	eng	Tom tried to hit me last night.
5852100	eng	I'm so glad you are not upset.
5852101	eng	I love basketball.
5852102	eng	There's no way we can do that by 2:30.
5852103	eng	I have a radio.
5852104	eng	It was a great surprise.
5852105	eng	I've already been questioned by the police.
5852106	eng	Tom took a book from the shelf.
5852107	eng	I'm still in a state of shock.
5852108	eng	I like the change.
5852109	eng	There's nothing else to be worried about.
5852110	eng	I have a piano.
5852111	eng	Is doing that difficult?
5852112	eng	I've done everything that needs to be done.
5852113	eng	Tom told me to be here by 2:30.
5852114	eng	I'm still planning to do that.
5852115	eng	I just need sleep.
5852116	eng	This problem still needs to be solved.
5852117	eng	I have a guest.
5852118	eng	How's your garden doing?
5852119	eng	I've told you a dozen times not to do that.
5852120	eng	Tom told me he got there first.
5852121	eng	I think I'm pretty generous.
5852122	eng	I have three cars.
5852123	eng	You don't have to do that by yourself.
5852124	eng	I have a beard.
5852125	eng	French is easy to learn.
5852126	eng	I always eat breakfast cereal without sugar.
5852127	eng	Tom told me about the accident.
5852128	eng	I'm very sorry for my actions.
5852129	eng	I have three DUIs.
5852130	eng	Did you really get kicked off the team?
5852131	eng	I hated Boston.
5852132	eng	Everything's going well.
5852133	eng	I didn't do what you've accused me of doing.
5852134	eng	Tom thought of a good solution.
5852135	eng	I've been drinking since 2:30.
5852136	eng	I have split ends.
5852137	eng	Do you think you'll ever go to college?
5852138	eng	I hate running.
5852139	eng	Don't be afraid to sing.
5852140	eng	I didn't think that this would happen again.
5852141	eng	Tom thinks he knows everything.
5852142	eng	I've been having a rough time.
5852143	eng	I have short hair.
5852144	eng	How are they going to enforce that law?
5852145	eng	I hate jogging.
5852146	eng	Do you think I'm biased?
5852147	eng	I drink at least three cups of coffee a day.
5852148	eng	Tom thanked me for the present.
5852149	eng	I've been told not to do this.
5852150	eng	I have curly hair.
5852151	eng	How are you at controlling your temper?
5852152	eng	I hailed a cab.
5852153	eng	Do you have to sing now?
5852154	eng	I have several paintings hanging on my wall.
5852155	eng	Tom seems to want Mary to stay.
5852156	eng	I've been working all my life.
5852157	eng	I have brown eyes.
5852158	eng	How can you argue with logic like that?
5852159	eng	I had to smile.
5852160	eng	Do I look sleepy to you?
5852161	eng	I haven't even thought about doing that yet.
5852162	eng	Tom said that I looked annoyed.
5852163	eng	I've got to start working out.
5852164	eng	I have black hair.
5852165	eng	How can you be sure that never happens?
5852166	eng	I had to hurry.
5852167	eng	Can you help me do this?
5852168	eng	I just wish you could've been there with me.
5852169	eng	Tom said I was being obnoxious.
5852170	eng	I've tried doing that already.
5852171	eng	I have a fast car.
5852172	eng	How can you not love someone like that?
5852173	eng	I had jeans on.
5852174	eng	Aren't we going do that?
5852175	eng	I promise you that I'll never do that again.
5852176	eng	Tom rode his bike to the store.
5852177	eng	I've tried everything already.
5852178	eng	I can't do it all.
5852179	eng	How can you turn down a deal like that?
5852180	eng	I had a choice.
5852181	eng	Are you still on a diet?
5852182	eng	I sometimes have trouble remembering things.
5852183	eng	Tom put his hand over his face.
5852184	eng	I almost never have nightmares.
5852185	eng	I brought a salad.
5852186	eng	How come the guys I want never want me?
5852187	eng	I got very mad.
5852188	eng	You're pretty stubborn.
5852189	eng	I suppose I'll get used to it after a while.
5852190	eng	Tom didn't give an explanation.
5852191	eng	I always knew it was important.
5852192	eng	I always get lost.
5852193	eng	How common are these kinds of problems?
5852194	eng	I got no reply.
5852195	eng	Why would anyone leave?
5852196	eng	I was just pretending I was enjoying myself.
5852197	eng	That's probably what Tom meant.
5852198	eng	I always make a mess of things.
5852199	eng	I always eat well.
5852200	eng	How could something like that get lost?
5852201	eng	I got it wrong.
5852202	eng	Why shouldn't we leave?
5852203	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to make you happy.
5852204	eng	I've never told Tom about that.
5852205	eng	I always wanted to be a cowboy.
5852206	eng	I'm stressed out.
5852207	eng	How did the two of you meet each other?
5852208	eng	I got it right.
5852209	eng	Why is truth important?
5852210	eng	I'm very busy and don't have much free time.
5852211	eng	I've already told Tom about it.
5852212	eng	I always wanted to be a writer.
5852213	eng	I'm really drunk.
5852214	eng	How did you become interested in music?
5852215	eng	I got into bed.
5852216	eng	Why can't we do it now?
5852217	eng	I've already sung three folks songs tonight.
5852218	eng	I'm very young compared to Tom.
5852219	eng	I appreciate you talking to me.
5852220	eng	I'm not that old.
5852221	eng	How did you get that scar on your chin?
5852222	eng	I got a tattoo.
5852223	eng	Why aren't you cooking?
5852224	eng	I've caused everyone enough trouble already.
5852225	eng	I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
5852226	eng	I believe the opposite is true.
5852227	eng	I'm not that bad.
5852228	eng	How did you know I needed one of these?
5852229	eng	I glanced back.
5852230	eng	Who's going to do what?
5852231	eng	I ate all the cookies that were on the plate.
5852232	eng	I'm glad that Tom wasn't there.
5852233	eng	I can remember it very vividly.
5852234	eng	I'm not so smart.
5852235	eng	How did you know I wanted one of these?
5852236	eng	I glanced away.
5852237	eng	Who wouldn't want that?
5852238	eng	I can't figure out how to say this in French.
5852239	eng	I would like to go and see Tom.
5852240	eng	I can't get my tractor started.
5852241	eng	I'm not prepared.
5852242	eng	How do things like this keep happening?
5852243	eng	I finally left.
5852244	eng	Who wouldn't like that?
5852245	eng	I do my best to avoid talking about politics.
5852246	eng	I told Tom not to believe Mary.
5852247	eng	I can't let you do this for me.
5852248	eng	I'm not homeless.
5852249	eng	How do you choose which projects to do?
5852250	eng	I felt trapped.
5852251	eng	Where are your jackets?
5852252	eng	I had intended to go shopping this afternoon.
5852253	eng	I know his real name isn't Tom.
5852254	eng	I can't really comment on that.
5852255	eng	I'm not drinking.
5852256	eng	How do you decide what's right for you?
5852257	eng	I felt nothing.
5852258	eng	When should we do that?
5852259	eng	I hope the police catch the guy who did this.
5852260	eng	I didn't like the way Tom sang.
5852261	eng	I can't say any more than that.
5852262	eng	I'm not diabetic.
5852263	eng	How do you encourage people to do that?
5852264	eng	I felt foolish.
5852265	eng	What's the real reason?
5852266	eng	I know that you don't speak French very well.
5852267	eng	I didn't answer Tom's question.
5852268	eng	I can't speak to you right now.
5852269	eng	I'm not deranged.
5852270	eng	How do you find time to do the laundry?
5852271	eng	I felt awkward.
5852272	eng	What's happened so far?
5852273	eng	I never could've done this without your help.
5852274	eng	I complained to Tom about that.
5852275	eng	I could do that if I wanted to.
5852276	eng	I'm not demented.
5852277	eng	How do you prepare for a job like this?
5852278	eng	I felt ashamed.
5852279	eng	What'll the results be?
5852280	eng	I received a strange phone call this morning.
5852281	eng	I already know what Tom thinks.
5852282	eng	I decided that was a good sign.
5852283	eng	I'm not autistic.
5852284	eng	How has your experience been different?
5852285	eng	I felt amazing.
5852286	eng	What'll the outcome be?
5852287	eng	I spoke slowly, so everyone could understand.
5852288	eng	Do I seem very old to you, Tom?
5852289	eng	I did the same thing in Boston.
5852290	eng	I'm not an angel.
5852291	eng	How long do you think we can stay here?
5852292	eng	I fed the pigs.
5852293	eng	What was your strategy?
5852294	eng	I stood in line for more than thirty minutes.
5852295	eng	What would you have done, Tom?
5852296	eng	I didn't do my job well enough.
5852297	eng	I'm not a racist.
5852298	eng	How long have you been teaching tennis?
5852299	eng	I expect a lot.
5852300	eng	What do you do all day?
5852301	eng	I usually walk to school if it isn't raining.
5852302	eng	Tom would've liked to do that.
5852303	eng	I didn't know this at the time.
5852304	eng	I'm not a prince.
5852305	eng	How many bands will be playing tonight?
5852306	eng	I eat anything.
5852307	eng	What did we do with it?
5852308	eng	I want to become someone you can be proud of.
5852309	eng	Tom wants to come and see you.
5852310	eng	I didn't really think about it.
5852311	eng	I'm not a madman.
5852312	eng	How many inches did you grow last year?
5852313	eng	I drank a shot.
5852314	eng	What did the doctor do?
5852315	eng	I'll do whatever I can to protect all of you.
5852316	eng	Tom said that I was too noisy.
5852317	eng	I didn't sleep much that night.
5852318	eng	I'm not a killer.
5852319	eng	How many of us have actually done that?
5852320	eng	I drank a beer.
5852321	eng	We're all pretty tired.
5852322	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to achieve my goal.
5852323	eng	Tom said that I sounded tired.
5852324	eng	I didn't think I was that good.
5852325	eng	I'm not a farmer.
5852326	eng	How many of you don't have an umbrella?
5852327	eng	I did it wrong.
5852328	eng	We really enjoyed that.
5852329	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get my son back.
5852330	eng	Tom said that I can't come in.
5852331	eng	I didn't want to offend anyone.
5852332	eng	I won't bite you.
5852333	eng	How many people have I insulted so far?
5852334	eng	I cut the tape.
5852335	eng	We might as well leave.
5852336	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get what I want.
5852337	eng	Tom must be expecting company.
5852339	eng	I won't back off.
5852340	eng	How many times are we going to do this?
5852341	eng	I cut the rope.
5852342	eng	We aren't finished yet.
5852343	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to stay where I am.
5852344	eng	Tom is better known than Mary.
5852345	eng	I don't agree with that at all.
5852346	eng	I waved the flag.
5852347	eng	How much can you make delivering pizzas?
5852348	eng	I created this.
5852349	eng	Was I supposed to sing?
5852350	eng	I'm not as young as the rest of my teammates.
5852351	eng	Tom has improved a great deal.
5852352	eng	I don't agree with that myself.
5852353	eng	I wasn't pleased.
5852354	eng	How much does it cost to fly to Boston?
5852355	eng	I changed that.
5852356	eng	Those were tough times.
5852357	eng	I've finally gotten used to living on a boat.
5852358	eng	They say Tom is very peculiar.
5852359	eng	I don't believe we can do that.
5852360	eng	I was mesmerized.
5852361	eng	How much longer do you want me to wait?
5852362	eng	I changed jobs.
5852363	eng	They might not do that.
5852364	eng	I always eat something before going to school.
5852365	eng	Perhaps Tom has fallen asleep.
5852366	eng	I don't care how much you make.
5852367	eng	I was in trouble.
5852368	eng	How much more of this do we need to do?
5852369	eng	I can't say no.
5852370	eng	They all made mistakes.
5852371	eng	I didn't arrive until it was already too late.
5852372	eng	I seldom speak to Tom anymore.
5852373	eng	I don't care who wins the game.
5852374	eng	I was in a fight.
5852375	eng	How much oil has actually been spilled?
5852376	eng	I can't refuse.
5852377	eng	That happened long ago.
5852378	eng	I don't have any friends who can speak French.
5852379	eng	I know his middle name is Tom.
5852380	eng	I don't care who wins the race.
5852381	eng	I was hypnotized.
5852382	eng	How much do we actually have to pay?
5852383	eng	I can't decide.
5852384	eng	Our plans have changed.
5852385	eng	I don't want to go upstairs alone in the dark.
5852386	eng	I gave Tom a key to my office.
5852387	eng	I don't care who you voted for.
5852388	eng	I was badly hurt.
5852389	eng	How often do you change your passwords?
5852390	eng	I can run fast.
5852391	eng	Nobody is stopping you.
5852392	eng	I never wanted to go there in the first place.
5852393	eng	I discussed the plan with Tom.
5852394	eng	I don't charge for my services.
5852395	eng	I wanted revenge.
5852396	eng	How often do you check your smartphone?
5852397	eng	I can go first.
5852398	eng	Life is difficult here.
5852399	eng	I should come to Boston to visit you sometime.
5852400	eng	How did you and Tom get along?
5852401	eng	I don't feel frustrated at all.
5852402	eng	I turned the key.
5852403	eng	How old were you when you were adopted?
5852404	eng	I brought that.
5852405	eng	Let me help you choose.
5852406	eng	I think we should stop doing what we're doing.
5852407	eng	I don't feel the least bit sad.
5852408	eng	I tried to smile.
5852409	eng	How would you feel if you lost $30,000?
5852410	eng	I bought a dog.
5852411	eng	Leave the windows open.
5852412	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to feed my children.
5852413	eng	What are Tom's children like?
5852414	eng	I don't follow politics at all.
5852415	eng	I sure am hungry.
5852416	eng	It's time for me to tell you the truth.
5852417	eng	I bought a car.
5852418	eng	It's not too expensive.
5852419	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get my kids back.
5852420	eng	Tom was too excited to sleep.
5852421	eng	I don't have a house in Boston.
5852422	eng	I stood up again.
5852423	eng	Let's see if we can get some work done.
5852424	eng	I began to run.
5852425	eng	It wasn't an easy race.
5852426	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to make that happen.
5852427	eng	Tom said I looked a bit pale.
5852428	eng	I don't have a lot of problems.
5852429	eng	I stifled a grin.
5852430	eng	What job are you going to tackle first?
5852431	eng	I began to eat.
5852432	eng	It was pretty exciting.
5852433	eng	I go jogging before breakfast almost every day.
5852434	eng	Tom must be somewhere around.
5852435	eng	I don't have a phone right now.
5852436	eng	I sliced the ham.
5852437	eng	When was last time you washed your car?
5852438	eng	I began pacing.
5852439	eng	It sure is windy today.
5852440	eng	I haven't yet deleted all the duplicate photos.
5852441	eng	Tom meant it as a compliment.
5852442	eng	I don't have a problem with it.
5852443	eng	I sipped my wine.
5852444	eng	Apparently, it's not too early to apply.
5852445	eng	I began crying.
5852446	eng	How do you really feel?
5852447	eng	I see no reason why you shouldn't go to Boston.
5852448	eng	Their names are Tom and Mary.
5852449	eng	I don't have to be nice to you.
5852450	eng	I shut the trunk.
5852451	eng	How am I going to get this accomplished?
5852452	eng	I arrived late.
5852453	eng	Here's the translation.
5852454	eng	I still have the first letter you ever sent me.
5852455	eng	It's time for Tom to go home.
5852456	eng	I don't like dancing very much.
5852457	eng	I seldom do that.
5852458	eng	How are we supposed to fix these issues?
5852459	eng	I arrived last.
5852460	eng	Go put some clothes on.
5852461	eng	I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
5852462	eng	I won't be able to catch Tom.
5852463	eng	I don't want to move to Boston.
5852464	eng	I sat very still.
5852465	eng	How are you going to deal with this one?
5852466	eng	I agreed to go.
5852467	eng	Doors open at 2:30 p.m.
5852468	eng	I thought you said we weren't going to be here.
5852469	eng	I wasn't sure what Tom meant.
5852470	eng	I have to do everything myself.
5852471	eng	I sat on the bed.
5852472	eng	How can I avoid making the same mistake?
5852473	eng	I've resigned.
5852474	eng	Do you plan to do that?
5852475	eng	I usually order the cheapest thing on the menu.
5852476	eng	I think Tom agrees with Mary.
5852477	eng	I haven't had any problems yet.
5852478	eng	I sat down again.
5852479	eng	How can so many things go wrong at once?
5852480	eng	I'm well paid.
5852481	eng	Come visit us sometime.
5852482	eng	I want to go to Boston just as badly as you do.
5852483	eng	I parked my car behind Tom's.
5852484	eng	I hope I don't starve to death.
5852485	eng	I sat at the bar.
5852486	eng	How can we live longer, healthier lives?
5852487	eng	I'm very thin.
5852488	eng	Can you jump that high?
5852489	eng	I was advised to stay out of that part of town.
5852490	eng	I lived with Tom for a while.
5852491	eng	I hope we'll get together soon.
5852492	eng	I said it was OK.
5852493	eng	How can we put a stop to this injustice?
5852494	eng	I'm very tall.
5852495	eng	Both men were executed.
5852496	eng	I wish I had enough money to buy a new bicycle.
5852497	eng	I don't think Tom was joking.
5852498	eng	I hope you'll have a good time.
5852499	eng	I resigned today.
5852500	eng	How can you be so calm about everything?
5852501	eng	I'm very sick.
5852502	eng	Both girls were crying.
5852503	eng	I wonder how much time we will have to do that.
5852504	eng	Tom said I looked beautiful.
5852505	eng	I just have to get out of here.
5852506	eng	I remained still.
5852507	eng	How come nobody ever hitchhikes anymore?
5852508	eng	I'm very rich.
5852509	eng	Be prepared to do that.
5852510	eng	I'll do whatever I can to make it easy for you.
5852511	eng	Tom has worked hard all day.
5852512	eng	I just wish I could find a job.
5852513	eng	I remained quiet.
5852514	eng	How come you never ask simple questions?
5852515	eng	I'm very fast.
5852516	eng	You voted, didn't you?
5852517	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get this job done.
5852518	eng	Tom did that all by himself.
5852519	eng	I lit a candle so we could see.
5852520	eng	I put on my coat.
5852521	eng	How could you still be upset about that?
5852522	eng	I'm unpopular.
5852523	eng	Will you be my friend?
5852524	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to make it up to you.
5852525	eng	I taught Tom how to do that.
5852526	eng	I made an omelet for breakfast.
5852527	eng	I owe you dinner.
5852528	eng	How did you become interested in design?
5852529	eng	I'm tone deaf.
5852530	eng	Where's your bathroom?
5852531	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to make things right.
5852532	eng	I showed Tom how to do that.
5852533	eng	I never wanted to study French.
5852534	eng	I opened the lid.
5852535	eng	How did you get the idea for this movie?
5852536	eng	I'm the chief.
5852537	eng	We should consider it.
5852538	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to protect my family.
5852539	eng	Tom teaches law at Harvard.
5852540	eng	I never wore those shoes again.
5852541	eng	I opened the box.
5852542	eng	How did you get those scars on your arm?
5852543	eng	I'm shivering.
5852544	eng	We do this every year.
5852545	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to save our marriage.
5852546	eng	Tom said I sounded worried.
5852547	eng	I sometimes sing in the shower.
5852548	eng	I opened the bag.
5852549	eng	How did you know where to look for that?
5852550	eng	I'm paralyzed.
5852551	eng	There's no water left.
5852552	eng	I'm not as busy this month as I was last month.
5852553	eng	Tom said I looked stunning.
5852554	eng	I sometimes sleep on the couch.
5852555	eng	I never was rich.
5852556	eng	How did you make the decision to retire?
5852557	eng	I'm on a roll.
5852558	eng	There's no money left.
5852559	eng	I'm sure you understand why we have to do this.
5852560	eng	Tom said I looked horrible.
5852561	eng	I stayed there for a long time.
5852562	eng	I never was poor.
5852563	eng	How do you keep cats out of your garden?
5852564	eng	I'm off today.
5852565	eng	That's still not true.
5852566	eng	I've been singing a lot of folk songs recently.
5852567	eng	Tom said I looked confused.
5852568	eng	I stayed there for three hours.
5852569	eng	I never was neat.
5852570	eng	Is there something you don't understand?
5852571	eng	I'm not weird.
5852572	eng	That sounds expensive.
5852573	eng	I've caused everybody a lot of trouble already.
5852574	eng	Is that man over there Tom?
5852575	eng	I think I was wrong about that.
5852576	eng	I might get lost.
5852577	eng	Is this the program you wanted to watch?
5852578	eng	I'm not tough.
5852579	eng	Somebody's in trouble.
5852580	eng	I didn't know we were supposed to be quiet here.
5852581	eng	I stole something from Tom.
5852582	eng	I think we'll have a good team.
5852583	eng	I might be right.
5852584	eng	Let's sit next to each other on the bus.
5852585	eng	I'm not petty.
5852586	eng	Please say that again.
5852587	eng	I don't know how I could've made such a mistake.
5852588	eng	Tom says he can't do that.
5852590	eng	I looked outside.
5852591	eng	Please put this back where you found it.
5852592	eng	I'm not naked.
5852593	eng	Please come back soon.
5852594	eng	I don't think I'll be able to eat anything else.
5852595	eng	Tom says Mary is a genius.
5852596	eng	I used to play piano at a club.
5852597	eng	I loaded the van.
5852598	eng	That's what I meant to discuss with you.
5852599	eng	I'm no genius.
5852600	eng	Mary is a brave woman.
5852601	eng	I know Mary is pretty, but she's not very smart.
5852602	eng	Tom said I seemed shocked.
5852603	eng	I walked all the way to Boston.
5852604	eng	I live there now.
5852605	eng	There are a lot of things I need to buy.
5852606	eng	I'm moving on.
5852607	eng	Let's keep doing this.
5852608	eng	I looked back to see if anyone was following me.
5852609	eng	Tom said I seemed puzzled.
5852610	eng	I was a waiter for a few years.
5852611	eng	I liked the idea.
5852612	eng	There are a lot of things I want to buy.
5852613	eng	I'm moving in.
5852614	eng	How deep is this pool?
5852615	eng	I might need this again, so don't throw it away.
5852616	eng	Tom said I seemed nervous.
5852617	eng	I was hoping you would help me.
5852618	eng	I kept whistling.
5852619	eng	There's a law that allows us to do that.
5852620	eng	I'm just fine.
5852621	eng	Everyone's interested.
5852622	eng	I really think you should stop drinking so much.
5852623	eng	Tom said I seemed excited.
5852624	eng	I went downtown this afternoon.
5852625	eng	I kept shoveling.
5852626	eng	Would you like to come with us tomorrow?
5852627	eng	I'm improving.
5852628	eng	Don't leave me behind.
5852629	eng	I recommend that you don't go there by yourself.
5852630	eng	Tom said I seemed annoyed.
5852631	eng	I went to bed early last night.
5852632	eng	I kept screaming.
5852633	eng	Do you plan on attending today's meeting?
5852634	eng	I'm happy now.
5852635	eng	Are your eyes hurting?
5852636	eng	I think I should refer you to another therapist.
5852637	eng	Tom said I looked unhappy.
5852638	eng	I won't be busy this afternoon.
5852639	eng	I just ate lunch.
5852640	eng	How many times have you done that so far?
5852641	eng	I'm giving up.
5852642	eng	Are you still thirsty?
5852643	eng	I think it'd be better if you didn't drink that.
5852644	eng	Tom said I looked stunned.
5852645	eng	I wonder how heavy that box is.
5852646	eng	I hit the target.
5852647	eng	How many times have you done this so far?
5852648	eng	I'm from here.
5852649	eng	We might not do that.
5852650	eng	I think we still need to work on this some more.
5852651	eng	Tom said I looked shocked.
5852652	eng	I'd rather walk home by myself.
5852653	eng	I hit a home run.
5852654	eng	It'll take a while for the cement to dry.
5852655	eng	I'm flustered.
5852656	eng	They may not be home.
5852657	eng	I use to never worry about how much things cost.
5852658	eng	Tom said I looked serious.
5852659	eng	I'll be coming with my brother.
5852660	eng	I have wavy hair.
5852661	eng	Please don't forget to bring a sandwich.
5852662	eng	I'm delighted.
5852663	eng	They just ignored me.
5852664	eng	I want to thank you for what you've done for us.
5852665	eng	Tom said I looked relaxed.
5852666	eng	I'm concentrating on something.
5852667	eng	I have seniority.
5852668	eng	That isn't likely to happen anytime soon.
5852669	eng	I'm coming in.
5852670	eng	That's the hard part.
5852671	eng	I'll already be asleep by the time you get here.
5852672	eng	Tom said I looked puzzled.
5852673	eng	I'm feeling a lot better today.
5852674	eng	I have long legs.
5852675	eng	That's not likely to happen anytime soon.
5852676	eng	I'm back home.
5852677	eng	People say I'm obese.
5852678	eng	I'll do whatever I can to help you get that job.
5852679	eng	Tom said I looked pleased.
5852680	eng	I'm glad they caught the thief.
5852681	eng	I have long hair.
5852682	eng	Things are changing so fast it scares me.
5852683	eng	I'm at school.
5852684	eng	Maybe we should quit.
5852685	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to correct my mistake.
5852686	eng	Tom said I looked healthy.
5852687	eng	I'm not interested in that job.
5852688	eng	I have flat feet.
5852689	eng	We all seem to be getting on pretty well.
5852690	eng	I'm angry now.
5852691	eng	Mary isn't beautiful.
5852692	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get you to love me.
5852693	eng	Tom said I looked furious.
5852694	eng	I'm not really sure what it is.
5852695	eng	I have dark hair.
5852696	eng	We need to reform our immigration system.
5852697	eng	I'm an intern.
5852698	eng	It's easy to do that.
5852699	eng	I'm sure I can find something to complain about.
5852700	eng	Tom said I looked annoyed.
5852701	epo	Sub la protekto de familio festi Kristnaskon, estas nuntempe verŝajne la plej bela el ĉiuj donacoj!
5852702	eng	I'm not talking to you anymore.
5852703	eng	I have arthritis.
5852704	eng	Do you really think you're better than me?
5852705	eng	I'm an ex-con.
5852706	eng	It sure is hot today.
5852707	eng	I'm worried about what other people might think.
5852708	eng	Tom is a very likable guy.
5852709	eng	I'm sure someone was just here.
5852710	eng	I have a new job.
5852711	eng	Let's see if we can get this done by 2:30.
5852712	eng	I'm a widower.
5852713	eng	Do I seem old to you?
5852714	eng	I do hope there'll be people I know at the party.
5852715	eng	Tom has many friends here.
5852716	eng	I'm the one who has to do that.
5852717	eng	I have a new car.
5852718	eng	That isn't the only thing that worries me.
5852719	eng	I'm a veteran.
5852720	eng	Can we talk with you?
5852721	eng	I don't think I should go out on a day like this.
5852722	eng	Tom does that really well.
5852723	eng	I'm the one who washed the car.
5852724	eng	I have a license.
5852725	eng	That's not worth the price they're asking.
5852726	eng	I'm a trucker.
5852727	eng	Are you still single?
5852728	eng	I don't understand why you like baseball so much.
5852729	eng	I'm one of Tom's teachers.
5852730	eng	I think that that won't work.
5852731	eng	I have a hot tub.
5852732	eng	We can't afford to make any more mistakes.
5852733	eng	I'm a surgeon.
5852734	eng	You've paid already.
5852735	eng	I thought the prices at that store were too high.
5852736	eng	I'm one of Tom's brothers.
5852737	eng	I've already washed the dishes.
5852738	eng	I have a fake ID.
5852739	eng	You're not afraid to sleep alone, are you?
5852740	eng	I'm a soldier.
5852741	eng	Why should we leave?
5852742	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to keep you next to me.
5852743	eng	I'm Tom's younger brother.
5852744	eng	I've been doing this for years.
5852745	eng	I had a good job.
5852746	eng	Has anyone ever told you anything about me?
5852747	eng	I'm a skeptic.
5852748	eng	Why did you stab me?
5852749	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to protect my children.
5852750	eng	I sat at the bar with Tom.
5852751	eng	I almost forgot to pay the rent.
5852752	eng	I got very drunk.
5852753	eng	Have you ever been up in a hot air balloon?
5852754	eng	I'm a regular.
5852755	eng	Who's idea was that?
5852756	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to protect what's mine.
5852757	eng	I know his name isn't Tom.
5852758	eng	I already know a lot about that.
5852759	eng	I got very angry.
5852760	eng	How did you expect me to know it was wrong?
5852761	eng	I'm a refugee.
5852762	eng	What's the big fuss?
5852763	eng	I'm interested in learning how to play the banjo.
5852764	eng	His name isn't really Tom.
5852765	eng	I always do things the same way.
5852766	eng	I got up at 6:30.
5852767	eng	If you don't hurry, we're going to be late.
5852768	eng	I'm a redneck.
5852769	eng	What's on your iPod?
5852770	eng	I'm not as drunk now as the last time you saw me.
5852771	eng	Even Tom didn't know that.
5852772	eng	I always get home at about 6:00.
5852773	eng	I got on the bus.
5852774	eng	Let me help you choose which dress to wear.
5852775	eng	I'm a realist.
5852776	eng	What's next for you?
5852777	eng	I didn't know we were supposed to be here by 2:30.
5852778	eng	What does Tom do all day?
5852779	eng	I always leave for work at 8:00.
5852780	eng	I got in the car.
5852781	eng	No matter what happens, I'll stay with you.
5852782	eng	I'm a psychic.
5852783	eng	What's my next step?
5852784	eng	I didn't think there was anybody I knew in Boston.
5852785	eng	Tom says I'm very stingy.
5852786	eng	I always wanted to study French.
5852787	eng	I got in the cab.
5852788	eng	That's not likely to happen in my lifetime.
5852789	eng	I'm a plumber.
5852790	eng	What's left to lose?
5852791	eng	I know that you don't want to do that by yourself.
5852792	eng	Tom says I look like you.
5852793	eng	I always worry about everything.
5852794	eng	I found the leak.
5852795	eng	There's no way you can do that by yourself.
5852796	eng	I'm a painter.
5852797	eng	What'll you live on?
5852798	eng	I must hurry back home before my mother misses me.
5852799	eng	I asked the same question again.
5852800	eng	I figured it out.
5852801	eng	They kept me waiting for over half an hour.
5852802	rus	Том сказал, что я не могу зайти.
5852803	eng	I'm a gymnast.
5852804	eng	We've already voted.
5852805	eng	I often eat things that my doctor tells me not to.
5852806	eng	Tom said I looked scared.
5852807	eng	I can easily wait till tomorrow.
5852808	eng	I felt all alone.
5852809	eng	This well is the deepest well in this area.
5852810	eng	I'm a florist.
5852811	eng	We must work harder.
5852812	eng	I thought I told you I didn't want you to be here.
5852813	eng	Tom said I looked pretty.
5852814	eng	I can't go into too much detail.
5852815	eng	I fell backwards.
5852816	eng	We'll have plenty of time to do that later.
5852817	eng	I'm a dreamer.
5852818	eng	That'll be possible.
5852819	eng	I thought I told you not to sing so late at night.
5852820	eng	Tom said I looked hungry.
5852821	eng	I can't paint as well as you do.
5852822	eng	I fed the horses.
5852823	eng	We're going to have an interesting evening.
5852824	eng	I'm a dentist.
5852825	eng	Sorry, I was a jerk.
5852826	eng	I thought it might be fun to eat out for a change.
5852827	eng	Tom didn't look offended.
5852828	eng	I can't play with you right now.
5852829	eng	I drank too much.
5852830	eng	We've been lucky that no one has been hurt.
5852831	eng	I'm a blogger.
5852832	eng	Please don't go yet.
5852833	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to make you proud of me.
5852834	eng	Tom did that really well.
5852835	eng	I can't remember how to do this.
5852836	eng	I did well today.
5852837	eng	We've been together for almost three years.
5852838	eng	I'm a big guy.
5852839	eng	Please be my friend.
5852840	eng	I've already done everything you've told me to do.
5852841	eng	Tom did that all himself.
5852842	eng	I can't say much more right now.
5852843	eng	I complain a lot.
5852844	eng	Do you know where we could get one of those?
5852845	eng	I'll go alone.
5852846	eng	My wife is a lawyer.
5852847	eng	I've been wanting to do this for a very long time.
5852848	eng	Tom badly needs our help.
5852849	eng	I can't see any need to do that.
5852850	eng	I closed the lid.
5852851	eng	It looks like you've gained a little weight.
5852852	eng	I wore gloves.
5852853	eng	Let's go over there.
5852854	eng	I've been wanting to learn French for a long time.
5852855	eng	I'm one of Tom's sisters.
5852856	eng	I can't see the need to do that.
5852857	eng	I can't swim yet.
5852858	eng	It's not as hot here as I expected it to be.
5852859	eng	I wore a mask.
5852860	eng	Let's begin at 2:30.
5852861	eng	I've finally gotten used to living here in Boston.
5852862	eng	I'm Tom's younger sister.
5852863	eng	I can't wait until I have a kid.
5852864	eng	I can't hurt you.
5852865	eng	Mary is just as beautiful as Alice, I think.
5852866	eng	I won't budge.
5852867	eng	It's still not over.
5852868	eng	I don't have enough money to buy everything I need.
5852869	eng	I'm Tom's French teacher.
5852870	eng	I can't wait until that happens.
5852871	eng	I called in sick.
5852872	eng	The man at the door didn't tell me his name.
5852873	eng	I winked back.
5852874	eng	It was a great idea.
5852875	eng	I don't often make mistakes when writing in French.
5852876	eng	I think I frightened Tom.
5852877	eng	I don't have to do that anymore.
5852878	eng	I broke that one.
5852879	eng	There are a lot of things I want to ask you.
5852880	eng	I went skiing.
5852881	eng	How did you respond?
5852882	eng	I don't think I'll have the time to help you today.
5852883	eng	How old are Tom and Mary?
5852884	eng	I don't like baseball very much.
5852885	eng	I began coughing.
5852886	eng	We have to be more aware of what's going on.
5852887	eng	I went abroad.
5852888	eng	Have we done enough?
5852889	eng	I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
5852890	eng	You can't depend on Tom.
5852891	eng	I don't like swimming very much.
5852892	eng	I became nervous.
5852893	eng	We need to be more aware of what's going on.
5852894	eng	I wasn't sick.
5852895	eng	Does your head ache?
5852896	eng	I haven't even thought about what needs to be done.
5852897	eng	Tom says I'm too skinny.
5852898	eng	I don't often talk on the phone.
5852899	eng	I became curious.
5852900	eng	It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
5852901	eng	I wasn't hurt.
5852902	eng	Who's next in line?
5852903	eng	I think it would be a good idea for you to do that.
5852904	eng	Tom says I'm pig-headed.
5852905	eng	I don't think I was disobedient.
5852906	eng	I ate your candy.
5852907	eng	There are a lot of things I need to tell you.
5852908	eng	I was unlucky.
5852909	eng	Who was that woman?
5852910	eng	I used to sing professionally, but I don't anymore.
5852911	eng	Tom says I eat too fast.
5852912	eng	I fell down and bruised my knee.
5852913	eng	I always says no.
5852914	eng	There are a lot of things I want to do today.
5852915	eng	I was unhappy.
5852916	eng	What are the risks?
5852917	eng	I wouldn't have done something like this last year.
5852918	eng	Tom said I looked tired.
5852919	eng	I hardly ever come here anymore.
5852920	eng	I always do this.
5852921	eng	We have to make sure people get back to work.
5852922	eng	I was thirsty.
5852923	eng	We're not safe yet.
5852924	eng	I'll put the kettle on and we'll have a cup of tea.
5852925	eng	Tom said I looked happy.
5852926	eng	I hardly ever go shopping alone.
5852927	eng	I almost laughed.
5852928	eng	We need to keep getting better at everything.
5852929	eng	I was talking.
5852930	eng	We can't just quit.
5852931	eng	I've already decided who to give my old bicycle to.
5852932	eng	Tom is fatter than Mary.
5852933	eng	I have a few gray hairs already.
5852934	eng	I almost fainted.
5852935	eng	You've already told me what I wanted to know.
5852936	eng	I was stabbed.
5852937	eng	This isn't helpful.
5852938	eng	I always pay for dinner whenever we go out together.
5852939	eng	Tom is a very kind man.
5852940	eng	I have trouble making decisions.
5852941	eng	I've just moved.
5852942	eng	Mary is even more beautiful than I remembered.
5852943	eng	I was spot on.
5852944	eng	That was dangerous.
5852945	eng	I can't afford to buy a new pair of shoes right now.
5852946	eng	Everybody looked at Tom.
5852947	eng	I have trouble talking to women.
5852948	eng	I've been fired.
5852949	eng	That's not worth the price they're asking for.
5852950	eng	I was so busy.
5852951	eng	My dad inspired me.
5852952	eng	I don't understand how I could've made this mistake.
5852953	eng	Tom says I'm too picky.
5852954	eng	I hope someone comes to help us.
5852955	eng	I'm your driver.
5852956	eng	The meeting didn't last as long as I expected.
5852957	eng	I was selfish.
5852958	eng	Isn't that our job?
5852959	eng	I have dozens of apps on my phone that I seldom use.
5852960	eng	Tom says I'm too nosey.
5852961	eng	I hope that doesn't ever happen.
5852962	eng	I'm very strong.
5852963	eng	The windows were already open when I got here.
5852964	eng	I was puzzled.
5852965	eng	Is it still Monday?
5852966	eng	I think it'd be better if you didn't go out tonight.
5852967	eng	Tom says I'm too bossy.
5852968	eng	I hope they catch the kidnapper.
5852969	eng	I'm unimpressed.
5852970	eng	They don't sell these kinds of things anymore.
5852971	eng	I was praying.
5852972	eng	How common is that?
5852973	eng	I was hoping the ice cream wouldn't melt so quickly.
5852974	eng	Tom said I looked pale.
5852975	eng	I never wanted to get a divorce.
5852976	eng	I'm the copilot.
5852977	eng	What color are you going to paint the ceiling?
5852978	eng	I was patient.
5852979	eng	Here are some tips.
5852980	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get the results I want.
5852981	eng	Tom is nicer than Mary.
5852982	eng	I never was a very good student.
5852983	eng	I'm still woozy.
5852984	eng	Everybody is hungry, so let's go ahead and eat.
5852985	eng	I was panting.
5852986	eng	Go clean your room.
5852987	eng	I don't know how you can work under these conditions.
5852988	eng	Tom has improved a lot.
5852989	eng	I never was very good at French.
5852990	eng	Last night, I went to sleep with the lights on.
5852991	eng	I was on time.
5852992	eng	Everyone's thirsty.
5852993	eng	I just remembered that I have something I have to do.
5852994	eng	Tom did it all himself.
5852995	eng	I often feel drowsy after lunch.
5852996	eng	I'm sick in bed.
5852997	eng	Now that I'm here, everything's going to be OK.
5852998	eng	I was on duty.
5852999	eng	Every box was full.
5853000	eng	I know that you won't be able to do that by yourself.
5853001	eng	Tom always looks tired.
5853002	eng	I often wear a black cowboy hat.
5853003	eng	I'm seldom late.
5853004	eng	That's what you should've done a long time ago.
5853005	eng	I was naughty.
5853006	eng	Doors open at 2:30.
5853007	eng	I make it a rule never to ask a woman how old she is.
5853008	eng	I'm Tom's older sister.
5853009	eng	I said good morning to everyone.
5853010	eng	I'm really sick.
5853011	eng	What's the real reason you didn't go to Boston?
5853012	eng	I was lenient.
5853013	eng	Don't make excuses.
5853014	eng	I thought you said you weren't going to smoke anymore.
5853015	eng	I was very mean to Tom.
5853016	eng	I should've been more assertive.
5853017	eng	I'm really rich.
5853018	eng	Do you remember what happened the day I met you?
5853019	eng	I was in pain.
5853020	eng	Don't feel too bad.
5853021	eng	I'll do whatever I can to make things easier for you.
5853022	eng	How's your mother, Tom?
5853023	eng	I suggest that you dress warmly.
5853024	eng	I'm quite timid.
5853025	eng	Everything in the store is half price this week.
5853026	eng	I was in love.
5853027	eng	Don't ever give in.
5853028	eng	I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to sing tonight.
5853029	eng	Tom swims really well.
5853030	eng	I think I can dance pretty well.
5853031	eng	I'm quite drunk.
5853032	eng	First, we're all going to have something to eat.
5853033	eng	I was in jail.
5853034	eng	Don't believe this.
5853035	eng	I couldn't swim as well as the other kids in my class.
5853036	eng	Tom said I looked old.
5853037	eng	I think we can do that tomorrow.
5853038	eng	I'm pretty rich.
5853039	eng	This is definitely more fun than doing homework.
5853040	eng	I was hurting.
5853041	eng	Don't believe them.
5853042	eng	I don't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen.
5853043	eng	Tom might not do that.
5853044	eng	I was a janitor a few years ago.
5853045	eng	I'm pigeon-toed.
5853046	eng	You didn't need to tell me that. I already knew.
5853047	eng	I was frantic.
5853048	eng	Don't believe that.
5853049	eng	I don't think there's any way I can get there on time.
5853050	eng	Tom asked us to leave.
5853051	eng	I was beginning to feel nervous.
5853052	eng	I'm not winning.
5853053	eng	Do you really think this is worth thirty dollars?
5853054	eng	I was foolish.
5853055	eng	Do I need to go on?
5853056	eng	I don't understand how I could've made such a mistake.
5853057	eng	I'm very close to Tom.
5853058	eng	I was famous when I was younger.
5853059	eng	I'm not violent.
5853060	eng	That's not worth the price they're asking for it.
5853061	eng	I was focused.
5853062	eng	Ask for more money.
5853063	eng	I don't want to discourage you from trying to do that.
5853064	eng	I left after Tom left.
5853065	eng	I was provoked into saying that.
5853066	eng	I'm intoxicated.
5853067	eng	There are a lot of things I have to do this week.
5853068	eng	I was defiant.
5853069	eng	Are you still cold?
5853070	eng	I haven't even thought about what I might do tomorrow.
5853071	eng	Everyone calls me Tom.
5853072	eng	I was very rich three years ago.
5853073	eng	I'm in mourning.
5853074	eng	There's plenty of whipped cream left in the bowl.
5853075	eng	I was crushed.
5853076	eng	Are you ever happy?
5853077	eng	I received three threatening phone calls this morning.
5853078	eng	Why is Tom on a diet?
5853079	eng	I was very shy when I was a kid.
5853080	eng	I'm happier now.
5853081	eng	Wouldn't it be nice to live in a house like that?
5853082	eng	I was content.
5853083	eng	Why can't we walk?
5853084	eng	I think we would've lost if our team had played yours.
5853085	eng	Tom says I'm selfish.
5853086	eng	I wasn't in yesterday afternoon.
5853087	eng	I'm getting wet.
5853088	eng	There was a birch tree in our garden, but it died.
5853089	eng	What'll that cost?
5853090	eng	I wish my parents would let me stay up later at night.
5853091	eng	Tom looked skeptical.
5853092	eng	I won't say anything about that.
5853093	eng	I'm coming, too.
5853094	eng	What's the real reason you didn't want to do that?
5853095	eng	I was bullied.
5853096	eng	We're out of food.
5853097	eng	I'd be grateful if you could help me move these boxes.
5853098	eng	I helped Tom do that.
5853099	eng	I wonder what we should do next.
5853100	eng	I'm chewing gum.
5853101	eng	If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.
5853102	eng	I was beat up.
5853103	eng	We can't use that.
5853104	eng	I'll do whatever I can to prevent that from happening.
5853105	eng	Tom was in an agony.
5853106	eng	I'd love to go fishing with you.
5853107	eng	I'm bored stiff.
5853108	eng	It won't be long before you get used to doing this.
5853109	eng	I was baffled.
5853110	eng	Try to act normal.
5853111	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to keep our family together.
5853112	eng	I stole Tom's money.
5853113	eng	I'll be happy when this is over.
5853114	eng	I'm at my place.
5853115	eng	How do you punish your children when they misbehave?
5853116	eng	I was alarmed.
5853117	eng	This tastes awful.
5853118	eng	I don't think it's safe to go out at night by yourself.
5853119	eng	We all respect Tom.
5853120	eng	I'll be the first to admit that.
5853121	eng	I'm an outsider.
5853122	eng	How many times have I told you not to use that word?
5853123	eng	I was adopted.
5853124	eng	This isn't unique.
5853125	eng	I don't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
5853126	eng	I was Tom's mentor.
5853127	eng	I'm a thirty-year-old housewife.
5853128	eng	I'm a therapist.
5853129	eng	You don't need to tell me what to do. I already know.
5853130	eng	I was a loner.
5853131	eng	The storm was bad.
5853132	eng	I haven't done that since I graduated from high school.
5853133	eng	I shook Tom's hand.
5853134	eng	I'm already thirty minutes late.
5853135	eng	I'm a sophomore.
5853136	eng	If you fail this class, you won't be able to graduate.
5853137	eng	I was a coach.
5853138	eng	My plan is better.
5853139	eng	I think we have enough time to finish doing that today.
5853140	eng	I liked Tom's idea.
5853141	eng	I'm coming to Boston in October.
5853142	eng	I'm a professor.
5853143	eng	It's so easy to be happy on a day like this, isn't it?
5853144	eng	I wanted that.
5853145	eng	It's not too cold.
5853146	eng	I thought it might be fun to go to Boston this weekend.
5853147	eng	How do I look, Tom?
5853148	eng	I'm going to ask you a question.
5853149	eng	I'm a paramedic.
5853150	eng	Many people have told me that they think I'm handsome.
5853151	eng	I wanted more.
5853152	eng	Everyone's sleepy.
5853153	eng	I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
5853154	eng	What will Tom say?
5853155	eng	I'm looking for a place to live.
5853156	eng	I'm a communist.
5853157	eng	You didn't have to tell me why because I already knew.
5853158	eng	I want it now.
5853159	eng	Don't harm anyone.
5853160	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to get you back into my life.
5853161	eng	I'm thirty minutes late already.
5853162	eng	I'm a chauffeur.
5853163	eng	The man waiting in the lobby wouldn't give me his name.
5853164	eng	I want advice.
5853165	eng	Do I look nervous?
5853166	eng	I've asked you repeatedly not to sing so late at night.
5853167	eng	I'm Tom's dentist.
5853168	eng	I've already decided what to do.
5853169	eng	I'm a cameraman.
5853170	eng	The man waiting in the lobby wouldn't tell me his name.
5853171	eng	I want a kiss.
5853172	eng	What caused this?
5853173	eng	I thought you said we weren't going to complain anymore.
5853174	eng	I wasn't with Tom.
5853175	eng	I've always wanted one of these.
5853176	eng	I wouldn't quit.
5853177	eng	The movie wasn't as interesting as I expected it to be.
5853178	eng	I walk slowly.
5853179	eng	We'll begin soon.
5853180	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to keep my children in school.
5853181	eng	How's Tom tonight?
5853182	eng	I've been very busy all morning.
5853183	eng	I won't say yes.
5853184	eng	The man I was talking to earlier never told me his name.
5853185	eng	I took a seat.
5853186	eng	We might do that.
5853187	eng	I can think of a lot of reasons why we shouldn't do that.
5853188	eng	Tom isn't stingy.
5853189	eng	I've never been late for school.
5853190	eng	I won't be back.
5853191	eng	There are many things that I don't understand very well.
5853192	eng	I tire easily.
5853193	eng	We demand change.
5853194	eng	I started working six days a week about three months ago.
5853195	eng	I won't help Tom.
5853196	eng	I almost never stay up all night.
5853197	eng	I won the match.
5853198	eng	We have to leave now if we want to get home before dark.
5853199	eng	I sweat a lot.
5853200	eng	Now is my chance.
5853201	eng	I think there's a good possibility that that will happen.
5853202	eng	I made Tom angry.
5853203	eng	I already have plans for tonight.
5853204	eng	I went upstairs.
5853205	eng	You're half a head taller than when you were here before.
5853206	eng	I surrendered.
5853207	eng	Nobody's singing.
5853208	eng	I think we've got enough money to buy everything we need.
5853209	eng	I left Tom alone.
5853210	eng	I can't do anything without help.
5853211	eng	I waved goodbye.
5853212	eng	Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
5853213	eng	I stole a gun.
5853214	eng	It's not too hot.
5853215	eng	I'm afraid we must go if we want to get home before dark.
5853216	eng	I laughed at Tom.
5853217	eng	I caught three fish this morning.
5853218	eng	I wasn't amused.
5853219	eng	It would be better if we just kept doing what we're doing.
5853220	eng	I stayed late.
5853221	eng	It was so boring.
5853222	eng	I don't think this is an appropriate time to discuss this.
5853223	eng	I helped Tom win.
5853224	eng	I confess I was wrong about that.
5853225	eng	I was very sick.
5853226	eng	On a hot day like this, the laundry will be dry in no time.
5853227	eng	I stayed home.
5853228	eng	Everyone's tired.
5853229	eng	I have a son who goes to the same school as your daughter.
5853230	eng	I got mad at Tom.
5853231	eng	I did that as quickly as I could.
5853232	eng	I was very poor.
5853233	eng	There are a lot of things I need to do before I can go home.
5853234	eng	I stayed cool.
5853235	eng	Don't be so mean.
5853236	eng	I remember when you could buy three of these for a dollar.
5853237	eng	I gave Tom a job.
5853238	eng	I don't think I ought to do that.
5853239	eng	I was very late.
5853240	eng	There are lots of things we could do to help those families.
5853241	eng	I stayed calm.
5853242	eng	We all felt bad.
5853243	eng	I think there's a real good possibility of that happening.
5853244	eng	I can't help Tom.
5853245	eng	I get along with all my brothers.
5853246	eng	I was shivering.
5853247	eng	You don't need to explain it to me. I already understand it.
5853248	eng	I stared back.
5853249	eng	Now's my chance.
5853250	eng	I thought I told you I didn't want you to do that anymore.
5853251	eng	I almost hit Tom.
5853252	eng	I hated spinach when I was a kid.
5853253	eng	I was sent home.
5853254	eng	If anybody had asked me if I were married, I'd have said yes.
5853255	eng	I spoke first.
5853256	eng	Do I look drunk?
5853257	eng	I wore glasses when I was a teenager, but I don't anymore.
5853258	eng	What'll Tom say?
5853259	eng	I have friends in many countries.
5853260	eng	I was plastered.
5853261	eng	When I was thirteen years old, I couldn't speak French at all.
5853262	eng	I smelled gas.
5853263	eng	Did you get wet?
5853264	eng	I'll do whatever it takes to keep our customers satisfied.
5853265	eng	Tom looked hurt.
5853266	eng	I haven't eaten steak in a while.
5853267	eng	I was perplexed.
5853268	eng	If anybody had asked me if I were married, I'd have said I was.
5853269	eng	I slowed down.
5853270	eng	What's changed?
5853271	eng	I'm about the same weight as I was at this time last year.
5853272	eng	I'm nice to Tom.
5853273	eng	I hope you've enjoyed yourselves.
5853274	eng	I was in a coma.
5853275	eng	If you fail this class, you'll have to take it again next year.
5853276	eng	I sleep a lot.
5853277	eng	We deserved it.
5853278	eng	I'm not going to tell you anything you don't already know.
5853279	eng	I'm leaving Tom.
5853280	eng	I know you want to quit your job.
5853281	eng	I was depressed.
5853282	eng	You didn't have to tell me about what happened. I already knew.
5853283	eng	I don't drive.
5853284	eng	Let's sit here.
5853285	eng	I've already told you everything I think you need to know.
5853286	eng	I'm Tom's niece.
5853287	eng	I meant to ask you that question.
5853288	eng	I was delirious.
5853289	eng	You're half a head taller than you were the last time I saw you.
5853290	eng	Everybody sang.
5853291	eng	I've often heard of these, but I've never seen one before.
5853292	eng	I'll assist Tom.
5853293	eng	I might come to Boston next week.
5853294	eng	I was courteous.
5853295	eng	Sometimes it seems to me that you just don't really want to be here.
5853296	eng	We had doubts.
5853297	eng	I knew you wouldn't like the food at Chuck's Bar and Grill.
5853298	eng	I'm Tom's twin.
