7544651	eng	I couldn't tell Tom what was going to happen.
7544652	eng	I don't know how to play the clarinet very well, but I'm pretty good at playing the flute.
7544653	eng	Tom was afraid of failure.
7544654	eng	We could probably make more money if we lowered the price since we could sell more.
7544655	eng	Tom should've been dancing with Mary.
7544656	eng	I didn't want to get married, but my parents really wanted me to, so I got married.
7544657	eng	I couldn't explain to Tom what was happening.
7544658	eng	We could probably make more money by lowering the price since we could sell more.
7544659	eng	Tom turned down the music.
7544660	eng	Which would you rather do, stay at home and watch TV or go out and see a movie?
7544661	eng	Tom should wait until Mary gets here.
7544662	eng	Instead of just the two of us, let's invite the whole class to do that with us.
7544663	eng	I could probably convince Tom not to do that.
7544664	eng	I don't play the clarinet very well, but I'm pretty good at playing the flute.
7544665	eng	Tom tried to fix it himself.
7544666	eng	We could see the flames coming toward us, so we ran in the other direction.
7544667	eng	Tom seemed really worried about Mary.
7544668	eng	I don't often eat in restaurants that have pictures of food on their menus.
7544669	eng	I chose not to do that the way Tom suggested.
7544670	eng	I usually eat two or three eggs for breakfast at least three times a week.
7544671	eng	Tom swept the living room.
7544672	eng	I've never been the kind of person who complains about things like that.
7544673	eng	Tom left Mary a message on the table.
7544674	eng	I was the only one at the meeting who didn't think that was a good idea.
7544675	eng	All Tom does all day long is play the guitar.
7544676	eng	I don't usually eat breakfast because I'd rather sleep as late as I can.
7544677	eng	Tom spent the night alone.
7544678	eng	I can't believe that you aren't at least willing to consider doing that.
7544679	eng	Tom is waiting for Mary on the porch.
7544680	eng	I wouldn't worry about unpacking. You probably won't be here very long.
7544681	eng	We won't do what Tom said he wants us to do.
7544682	eng	I don't want to have to explain this again, so please listen carefully.
7544683	eng	Tom slept on a park bench.
7544684	eng	Mr. Jackson is in the hospital, so I'll be teaching his classes today.
7544685	eng	Tom is the boss when Mary isn't home.
7544686	eng	I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to find my way out of the cave.
7544687	eng	We found Tom drunk sleeping on a park bench.
7544688	eng	I don't often eat in restaurants with pictures of food on their menus.
7544689	eng	Tom should do that inside.
7544690	eng	Some of the trees in our neighborhood were knocked down by the storm.
7544691	eng	Tom is planning to meet Mary at 2:30.
7544692	eng	If you don't do this now, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
7544693	eng	Until yesterday, I had never seen Tom dance.
7544694	eng	I could probably save myself a lot of time by just doing that myself.
7544695	eng	Tom seemed ready to leave.
7544696	eng	You can't have this kitten, but you can have any of the other ones.
7544697	eng	Tom is interfering with Mary's plans.
7544698	eng	My curtains were closed, so I didn't see what was happening outside.
7544699	eng	The decisive goal was scored by Tom Jackson.
7544700	eng	Let's forget about our differences and focus on how we're the same.
7544701	eng	Tom says he's feeling bad.
7544702	eng	I read somewhere that short people need more sleep than tall people.
7544703	eng	Tom is apologizing to Mary right now.
7544704	eng	I almost always take a shower in the morning before going to school.
7544705	eng	Letting Tom do that wasn't such a good idea.
7544706	eng	We won't have another chance to do that anytime in the near future.
7544707	eng	Tom says he wants to buy that.
7544708	eng	Please get here at least fifteen minutes before the meeting starts.
7544709	eng	Tom has been giving Mary good advice.
7544710	eng	Please get here at least fifteen minutes before the concert starts.
7544711	eng	It doesn't matter to me where Tom does that.
7544712	eng	I wouldn't have believed that if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
7544713	eng	Tom says he needs to buy a new pair of shoes.
7544714	eng	I won't go to all the meetings, but I'll try to go to some of them.
7544715	eng	Tom has been emailing Mary every day.
7544716	eng	How many people do you think are studying French here in Australia?
7544717	eng	It doesn't look like Tom is there right now.
7544718	eng	We won't get another chance to do that anytime in the near future.
7544719	eng	Tom quite often does that.
7544720	eng	I'd rather have this and not need it than need it and not have it.
7544721	eng	Tom has already decided to tell Mary.
7544722	eng	I wouldn't worry about unpacking. You probably won't be here long.
7544723	eng	I've known Tom since he was three years old.
7544724	eng	When I was in high school, I was the tallest student in my class.
7544725	eng	Tom pushed the plate away.
7544726	eng	We don't have enough time to do everything that needs to be done.
7544727	eng	Tom has already decided to help Mary.
7544728	eng	My curtains were open, so I could see what was happening outside.
7544729	eng	I've been waiting for Tom to do that for me.
7544730	eng	If you continue doing that that way, you'll probably get injured.
7544731	eng	Tom played pool with John.
7544732	eng	I wrote a message on the piece of paper and put it in the bottle.
7544733	eng	Tom has already decided to fire Mary.
7544734	eng	I've been drinking a lot more coffee recently than I usually do.
7544735	eng	I'm waiting for Tom to get back from Boston.
7544736	eng	We didn't get the chance to do that while we were in Australia.
7544737	eng	Tom paid that bill for me.
7544738	eng	I'm looking for a job that pays better than the one I have now.
7544739	eng	Tom drove Mary back to her apartment.
7544740	eng	I love playing basketball, but I don't enjoy watching it on TV.
7544741	eng	I'm not sure if it's Tom who should do that.
7544742	eng	I have to leave early today because I have to attend a funeral.
7544743	eng	Tom ought to be back soon.
7544744	eng	I don't know how to play the flute, but I can play the trumpet.
7544745	eng	Tom doesn't need to do that for Mary.
7544746	eng	When I was in high school, I was the best student in my class.
7544747	eng	I'm not planning to meet Tom at the airport.
7544748	eng	We had a lot of chances to do that while we were in Australia.
7544749	eng	Tom often went to parties.
7544750	eng	My weight now is the same as it was when I was in high school.
7544751	eng	Tom doesn't have to do that for Mary.
7544752	eng	Is it true that short people need more sleep than tall people?
7544753	eng	I'm not going to tell Tom what he should do.
7544754	eng	If you continue doing that that way, you'll likely get killed.
7544755	eng	Tom often goes to parties.
7544756	eng	I'm sorry, but I really don't have time to do that right now.
7544757	eng	I loved my ex-wife, but I just couldn't live with her anymore.
7544758	eng	I'd expected Tom to do that on October 20th.
7544759	eng	I kneeled down to get a better look at what was on the ground.
7544760	eng	Tom noticed a few changes.
7544761	eng	Do you know the names of all eight of your great-grandparents?
7544762	eng	Tom didn't expect Mary to be so tall.
7544763	eng	Could you please check the door to make sure that it's locked?
7544764	eng	I wondered if Tom should do that by himself.
7544765	eng	It's my job to tell everyone what was decided at the meeting.
7544766	eng	Tom needs a bottle opener.
7544767	eng	An opportunity like this only comes along once in a lifetime.
7544768	eng	Tom could see Mary sitting with John.
7544769	eng	We were just getting ready to leave when it started raining.
7544770	eng	I wondered if Tom had to do that by himself.
7544771	eng	We didn't get the chance to do that while we were in Boston.
7544772	eng	Tom must be really lonely.
7544773	eng	I want to know where I can buy something to eat around here.
7544774	eng	Tom can't help Mary do that tomorrow.
7544775	eng	I immediately ran downstairs to find out what was happening.
7544776	eng	I wonder who Tom thinks is going to do that.
7544777	eng	I don't want you to do anything about this until I get back.
7544778	eng	Tom likes going for walks.
7544779	eng	I don't spend a lot of time thinking about things like that.
7544780	eng	Tom called Mary to cancel their date.
7544781	eng	You're not allowed to have pets in this apartment building.
7544782	eng	I wonder who Tom sold his first painting to.
7544783	eng	You'll likely get another chance to do that this afternoon.
7544784	eng	Tom likes Australia a lot.
7544785	eng	We had a lot of chances to do that while we were in Boston.
7544786	eng	Tom bought Mary a bouquet of flowers.
7544787	eng	I suggest you keep your opinions to yourselves from now on.
7544788	eng	I told Tom where I'd learned how to do that.
7544789	eng	I can't afford to eat at an expensive restaurant every day.
7544790	eng	Tom liked the movie a lot.
7544791	eng	Why don't you tell us a little something about yourselves?
7544792	eng	Tom asked me for Mary's phone number.
7544793	eng	Who do you think is the best French speaker in your class?
7544794	eng	I told Tom what he should wear to the party.
7544795	eng	We need to decide what's important and what's unimportant.
7544796	eng	Tom just bought a new car.
7544797	eng	The best thing would be for you to do the work yourselves.
7544798	eng	Tom asked Mary where she'd done that.
7544799	eng	It would probably be a good idea not to do that right now.
7544800	eng	I told Tom about what I did over the summer.
7544801	eng	If I ever see you doing that again, I'll tell your father.
7544802	eng	Tom isn't a perfectionist.
7544803	eng	I'm sick of listening to the same kind of music every day.
7544804	eng	Tom asked Mary to take the trash out.
7544805	eng	I wanted to give you a chance to explain why you did that.
7544806	eng	I realize that Tom was the one who did that.
7544807	eng	I haven't eaten or drunk anything since yesterday morning.
7544808	eng	Tom isn't a good sculptor.
7544809	eng	I had a chance to do that yesterday, but I decided not to.
7544810	eng	Tom asked Mary to play drums with us.
7544811	eng	I don't want my parents to find out what we did yesterday.
7544812	eng	I haven't talked to Tom in a very long time.
7544813	eng	I could draw fairly well by the time I began kindergarten.
7544814	eng	Tom isn't a good salesman.
7544815	eng	You're old enough to take care of yourselves, aren't you?
7544816	eng	Tom asked Mary to get out of his way.
7544817	eng	You won't get another chance to do that until next month.
7544818	eng	I have no intention of giving Tom any money.
7544819	eng	Why on earth did you not do what you were supposed to do?
7544820	eng	Tom isn't a good musician.
7544821	eng	What's the spookiest thing that has ever happened to you?
7544822	eng	Tom asked Mary to get a hold of John.
7544823	eng	We were just starting to do that when it started raining.
7544824	eng	I don't usually eat the same thing Tom does.
7544825	eng	I'm not interested in learning how to fix a broken table.
7544826	eng	Tom isn't a good gardener.
7544827	eng	I wasn't very sleepy, so I stayed up and watched a movie.
7544828	eng	Tom asked Mary to explain her answer.
7544829	eng	I thought I told you not to buy anything from that store.
7544830	eng	I don't fight with Tom as much as I used to.

7564584	eng	Coming from the sunlit meadows into the forest's mazes, it seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending delights.
7564585	eng	For hundreds of years the forest has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds.
7564586	epo	Tomo ne povis trovi sian ombrelon.
7564587	eng	Yet Burzee has its inhabitants. Nature peopled it in the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs.
7564588	eng	As long as the Forest stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths.
7564589	eng	Civilization has never yet reached Burzee. Will it ever, I wonder?
7564590	eng	Have you heard of the great Forest of Burzee? Nurse used to sing of it when I was a child. She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves.
7564591	eng	Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named Necile.
7564592	eng	She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak.
7564593	eng	Once every year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest.
7564594	eng	She was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace.
7564595	deu	Ich werde so oft wie möglich kommen.
7564596	eng	It was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees.
7564597	eng	Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard.
7564598	eng	Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur.
7564599	eng	Her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade.
7564600	deu	Ich weiß, dass Tom das jeden Morgen tut.
7564601	eng	Her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset.
7564602	eng	Her lips were full red, pouting and sweet.
7564603	deu	Tom will jetzt nicht nach Hause gehen.
7564604	eng	For costume, she adopted oak-leaf green.
7564605	eng	All the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable.
7564606	eng	Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses.
7564607	deu	Ich ging in eine Buchhandlung.
7564608	eng	Necile's duties were few and simple.
7564609	eng	She kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her charges.
7564610	eng	She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact.
7564611	eng	In dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents.
7564612	deu	Tom hat sich bereits entschlossen zu bleiben.
7564613	eng	The weeds learned to avoid the forests where wood-nymphs dwelt.

7564616	eng	The loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh.
7564617	eng	The trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when fresh-sprouted.
7564618	deu	Tom hat die ganze Welt bereist.
7564619	eng	Succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph's joyous spirit loved.
7564620	eng	The forest-dwellers did not lack amusement.
7564621	eng	Each full moon they danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen.
7564622	deu	Tom braucht keine drei Fahrräder.
7564623	eng	There were also the Feast of Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day. But these periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between.
7564624	eng	But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs.
7564625	eng	The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure.
7564626	eng	Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men.
7564627	eng	"We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades," said Ak, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, "that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth."
7564628	spa	A Tom no le gusta mucho Australia.
7564629	spa	Tom no necesita tres bicicletas.
7564630	eng	Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor thing's misery. Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.
7564631	eng	Not long ago, I found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death.
7564632	eng	Their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent. But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path, so they were long on the road.
7564633	eng	In the meantime, the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.
7564634	eng	"Poor things!" murmured the Queen softly. "What did you do?"
7564635	eng	I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay. Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.
7564636	spa	Apenas al doblar la esquina, Tom se quitó el gorro y lo escondió en el bolsillo.
7564637	eng	"I am glad you did thus," said the good Queen.
7564638	spa	Siempre voy sin gorro.
7564639	eng	Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: "I, too, am glad!"
7564640	spa	Ahora todavía no hace tanto frío.
7564641	eng	I looked about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously.
7564642	eng	Not far away, screened by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal.
7564643	eng	"And what did you do, Ak?" asked the Queen, breathlessly.
7564644	eng	I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger. And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.
7564645	eng	"I am glad you did thus," said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief.
7564646	eng	The nymph, filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group.
7564647	eng	Swiftly, her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of the forest.
7564648	eng	Never until now had she ventured so far.
7564649	eng	Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet.
7564650	eng	She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man.
7564651	eng	All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among them.
7564652	eng	Peering through the trees, Necile saw the child lying on the grass.
7564653	eng	The child was sleeping sweetly.
7564654	eng	The babe was newborn, chubby and pink.
7564655	eng	The child was entirely helpless.
7564656	eng	While the nymph gazed, the infant opened its eyes, smiled upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms.
7564657	eng	In another instant, Necile had caught the infant to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.
7564658	eng	"There is a strange presence in the Forest," he declared.
7564659	eng	Then the Queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes.
7564660	eng	"Let me keep the child!" she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication.
7564661	eng	What is your desire, Necile?
7564662	eng	Ak, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard slowly.
7564663	eng	The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight.
7564664	eng	"What shall we call him, Necile?" she asked, smiling. "He must have a name, you know."
7564665	eng	He must have a name, you know.
7564666	eng	"Let him be called Claus," answered Necile.
7564667	eng	Tom traveled the whole world.
7564668	eng	Tom was asked to return.
7564669	eng	The nymphs clapped their hands in delight.
7564670	eng	Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon.
7564671	eng	His thoughts and words were sweet and gentle, for the nymphs knew no evil and their hearts were pure and loving.
7564672	eng	The Ryls are required to watch over the flowers and plants, as the nymphs watch over the forest trees.
7564673	eng	The brilliant colors possessed by the full-blown flowers are due to the dyes placed in the soil by the Ryls, which are drawn through the little veins in the roots and the body of the plants, as they reach maturity.
7564674	eng	The Knooks' duty is to watch over the beasts of the world, both gentle and wild.
7564675	eng	The Fairies are the guardians of mankind.
7564676	eng	There are instances on record where the Fairies have shown themselves to human beings, and have even conversed with them; but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind unseen and unknown.
7564677	eng	The Fairies are very just and impartial.
7564678	eng	The idea had never occurred to Tom.
7564679	eng	The idea had never occurred to him.
7564680	eng	The idea had never occurred to her.
7564681	eng	No forest flower was trampled beneath his feet, lest the friendly Ryls should be grieved.
7564682	eng	He never interfered with the beasts of the forest, lest his friends the Knooks should become angry.
7564683	eng	To him, the forest was the world.
7564684	eng	He had no idea that millions of toiling, striving human creatures existed.
7564685	eng	And he was happy and content.
7564686	eng	Years pass swiftly in Burzee, for the nymphs have no need to regard time in any way. Even centuries make no change in the dainty creatures; ever and ever they remain the same, immortal and unchanging.
7564687	eng	Claus, however, being mortal, grew to manhood day by day.
7564688	eng	His stout legs carried him far into the forest's heart, where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries, as well as several sweet and wholesome roots.
7564689	eng	I haven't been feeling great since this morning.
7564690	eng	She followed him through the forest paths, as did many of her sister nymphs, explaining as they walked all the mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature of the living things which dwelt beneath its shade.
7564691	eng	The language of the beasts became clear to little Claus; but he never could understand their sulky and morose tempers.
7564692	eng	Only the squirrels, the mice and the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures.
7564693	eng	He could sing the songs of the bees, recite the poetry of the wood-flowers and relate the history of every blinking owl in the forest.
7564694	eng	Bid good bye, for a time, to Necile and her sisters; for you shall accompany me on my journey through the world.
7564695	eng	Necile wept for the first time in her life, and clung to the boy's neck as if she could not bear to let him go.
7564696	eng	Until now, he had thought himself the only one of his kind upon the earth.
7564697	eng	Then the vast forest seemed to fall away from their feet, and the youth found himself passing swiftly through the air at a great height.
7564698	eng	One of the first laws of the Forest is obedience, and Claus had no thought of disobeying the Master's wish.
7564699	eng	"So long as you hold fast to my girdle, you will remain unseen by all mankind, though seeing clearly yourself.
7564700	eng	The immortals are few; but the mortals are many.
7564701	eng	Ragged little ones rolled in the dust of the streets, playing with scraps and pebbles. Other children, gaily dressed, were propped upon cushions and fed with sugar-plums. Yet the children of the rich were not happier than those playing with the dust and pebbles, it seemed to Claus.
7564702	eng	"Childhood is the time of man's greatest content," said Ak. "'Tis during these years of innocent pleasure that the little ones are most free from care."
7564703	eng	The difference in the wealth of the parents determines the lot of the child. Some are carefully tended and clothed in silks and dainty linen; others are neglected and covered with rags.
7564704	eng	"Then why, if man must perish, is he born?" demanded the boy.
7564705	eng	Why, if man must perish, is he born?
7564706	eng	Everything perishes except the world itself.
7564707	eng	While life lasts everything on earth has its use. The wise seek ways to be helpful to the world, for the helpful ones are sure to live again.
7564708	eng	Much of this Claus failed to understand fully, but a longing seized him to become helpful to his fellows.
7564709	eng	He remained grave and thoughtful while they resumed their journey.
