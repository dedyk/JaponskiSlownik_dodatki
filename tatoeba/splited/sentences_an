704136	jbo	mi nelci lo xunre rozgu
704137	eng	Sentences can teach us a lot. And a lot more than just words.
704138	eng	So we love sentences. But, even more, we love languages.
704139	eng	And what we really want is to have many sentences in many — and any — languages.
704140	eng	This is why Tatoeba is multilingual. But not that kind of multilingual. Not the kind where languages are simply being paired up together, and where some pairs are left behind.
704141	eng	Tatoeba is really multilingual. All the languages are interconnected.
704142	eng	If an Icelandic sentence has a translation in English, and the English sentence has a translation in Swahili, then indirectly, this will provide a Swahili translation for the Icelandic sentence.

704148	ita	Quella è la donna che voleva vederti.

704157	ita	Vorrei che conoscessi i miei genitori.
704158	eng	And actually, this project needs everyone.
704159	eng	Languages are not carved in stone. Languages live through all of us.
704160	eng	We want to capture all the uniqueness of each language. And we as well want to capture their evolution through time.
704161	eng	But you know, it would be sad to collect all these sentences, and keep them for ourselves. Because there's so much you can do with them. Which is why Tatoeba is open. Our source code is open. Our data is open.
704162	jbo	ko na jai daspo lo selnu'e ca da
704163	eng	We're releasing all the sentences we collect under the Creative Commons Attribution license.
704164	eng	This means you can reuse them freely for a textbook, for an application, for a research project, for anything!

704168	jbo	.i poi'i la .tato'ebas. ku kau ke'a ckaji
704169	eng	But that's not the whole picture. Tatoeba is not just an open, collaborative, multilingual dictionary of sentences. It's part of an ecosystem that we want to build.
704170	eng	We want to bring language tools to the next level. We want to see innovation in the language learning landscape. And this cannot happen without open language resources which cannot be built without a community which cannot contribute without efficient platforms.
704171	ita	Cosa vuoi comprare per lei?
704172	eng	So ultimately, with Tatoeba we are only building the foundations… to make the Web a better place for language learning.
